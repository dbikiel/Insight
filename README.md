# Ninjas versus Puppies

This project ws developed during the Jan-2020 to Feb-2020 as part of the Insight Data Science Fellows Programs. 

Context:
People tend to watch content in groups. For example, couples watch shows and movies. When personal tastes are similar, there is no conflict on what to see. However, in a IPSO's survey for Netflix it was pointed out that 71% of the couples that watch Netflix engage in some sort of negotiation over what to watch. If the tastes are dissimilar, this negotiation can be very long and unproductive, leading to the "I pick this, you pick next strategy" which potentally doesn't maximize overall happiness.

Need:
How to recommend an item (in this case a movie) to a couple given their particular tastes? How we find a potential "middle" item that goes from the ideal one for one user to the ideal of the second?

Vision:
A recommender system based in content-similarity, leveraged by user-filtering capable to recommend the best item to both users simultaneously.

Outcome:
A webapp capable to provide an item given the input of both users.
