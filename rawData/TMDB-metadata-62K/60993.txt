It witnesses the rise and fall of one family of entrepreneurs, the Kuukkanen family from Salla, Lapland, side-by-side with the current changes in the values of our society. In combining private and personal family memories with ongoing changes in the scenery, the documentary asks: How to avoid irreversible changes in the nature when earning your living?  Selling the Silence is a journey to the North, past and present. Sometimes the journey can be surprising, sometimes sad, sometimes absurd in a black Finnish way. When the film asks: \u201dWhat is the price of the wilderness?\u201d, it is also a question of identity: Who you really are? What is your real nature?", "popularity": 0.624, "poster_path": null, "production_companies": [{"id": 6882, "logo_path": null, "name": "Filmimaa", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FI", "name": "Finland"}], "release_date": "2011-03-11", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 70, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fi", "name": "suomi"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Salla - Selling the Silence", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4640c3a368484e0866d1", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 232105, "job": "Director", "name": "Markku Tuurna", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe4640c3a368484e0866d7", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 232106, "job": "Writer", "name": "Tarja Kylm\u00e4", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe4640c3a368484e0866dd", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 232105, "job": "Writer", "name": "Markku Tuurna", "profile_path": null}]}}
