After the young man runs away from being shackled to a cabin, he spends the winter in a cave and emerges as a bear (obviously a man wearing a bear suit). He is taken in by a writer who teaches him how to use a computer, which somehow poses no problem. The bear speaks like the young man and for awhile tries working as a computer operator, undoubtedly raising questions about the standards in that field. While invited to tea one afternoon, the bear kills a dog in self-defense and is forced to head back to his cave for the winter -- where he emerges after a long hibernation as the young man. In retrospect, contact with the computing world had quite a transforming effect.", "popularity": 0.708, "poster_path": "/xbJGR8sLJBEHJo9zaNxhpTIZBvZ.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 12009, "logo_path": null, "name": "El\u00edas Querejeta Producciones Cinematogr\u00e1ficas S.L.", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "ES", "name": "Spain"}], "release_date": "1984-04-05", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 115, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "es", "name": "Espa\u00f1ol"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Ferocious", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.5, "vote_count": 2, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "", "credit_id": "56f83887c3a3686a6e007ea9", "gender": 2, "id": 965, "name": "Fernando Fern\u00e1n G\u00f3mez", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/imdGxyxOGfbVPCQsutPI5StAncv.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "", "credit_id": "56f83896c3a3686a61007353", "gender": 2, "id": 15185, "name": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Pasquale", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/sRa3X7UkMCT9Je068Q6N5b1mwoX.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "", "credit_id": "56f838a59251412fdd00352b", "gender": 0, "id": 1576863, "name": "Javier Garc\u00eda", "order": 3, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "", "credit_id": "56f838b39251410c170019ac", "gender": 0, "id": 1382975, "name": "Elene Lizarralde", "order": 4, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "", "credit_id": "5a240b2e0e0a264cbe0c54a2", "gender": 0, "id": 1934135, "name": "Julio C\u00e9sar Sanz", "order": 5, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 6, "character": "Voz en off en la TV", "credit_id": "5a240b64c3a3680b8a0c5057", "gender": 0, "id": 1423053, "name": "Rafael Taibo", "order": 6, "profile_path": null}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "5a240bc692514103330c4e07", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 13833, "job": "Producer", "name": "El\u00edas Querejeta", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5a240b75c3a3680b9a0d1e6d", "department": "Crew", "gender": 0, "id": 37736, "job": "Cinematography", "name": "Teo Escamilla", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "56f837dc9251410a31000ba2", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 649147, "job": "Director", "name": "Manuel Guti\u00e9rrez Arag\u00f3n", "profile_path": null}]}}
