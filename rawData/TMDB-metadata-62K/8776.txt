Directed by Louis Mouchet, La Constellation Jodorowsky includes a lengthy on-camera interview with Jodorowsky in Spanish with subtitles. Marcel Marceau, Fernando Arrabal, Peter Gabriel, Jean \"Moebius\" Giraud, and Jean Pierre Vignau make appearances discussing their various projects with the director. In addition to the interview and film clips, Mouchet features some bizarre footage from Jodorowsky\u2019s absurdist plays in which topless women splattered with paint writhe around the stage in a theatrical production meant to represent The Panic Movement, i.e., an artistic expression in which reason cannot fully express the human experience.", "poster_path": "/tnhJK6rc864Ztt2ArSuShGmrmDH.jpg", "release_date": "1994-01-01", "title": "The Jodorowsky Constellation", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 9, "popularity": 2.781}, {"id": 263112, "video": false, "vote_count": 6, "vote_average": 7.1, "title": "Current", "release_date": "1964-04-12", "original_language": "hu", "original_title": "Sodr\u00e1sban", "genre_ids": [18], "backdrop_path": "/rmxWzTMhAlXcafbQ8cGF51WgRlo.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A group of students cope with the disappearance of their friend.", "poster_path": "/hlNTzhxYH15YIFmlIlRJcKXgW9p.jpg", "popularity": 1.597}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 12}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 5, "character": "Major", "credit_id": "52fe44b8c3a36847f80a668f", "gender": 2, "id": 56292, "name": "Zolt\u00e1n Latinovits", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/fYVilRy8MhVxzjgBD2RWv3QwT37.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 8, "character": "Lajos T\u00f3t, chief fireman", "credit_id": "52fe44b8c3a36847f80a669b", "gender": 2, "id": 56295, "name": "Sinkovits Imre", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/dyanBNucUeEa5k6f62zzbqjB9RL.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 9, "character": "Mrs. T\u00f3t", "credit_id": "52fe44b8c3a36847f80a669f", "gender": 0, "id": 56296, "name": "M\u00e1rta F\u00f3nay", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/hNJZOrT5WcUN7g2cqyjocTO0h0.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 7, "character": "\u00c1gika T\u00f3t", "credit_id": "52fe44b8c3a36847f80a6697", "gender": 1, "id": 56294, "name": "Venczel Vera", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/jZUyVu0gCVTKtTdEQIIfhbO9yG5.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 6, "character": "Gyuri, postman", "credit_id": "52fe44b8c3a36847f80a6693", "gender": 2, "id": 56293, "name": "Istv\u00e1n D\u00e9gi", "order": 4, "profile_path": "/go97jJmvEMe5x7p7rR9gAny0b8A.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 14, "character": "Parson", "credit_id": "52fe44b9c3a36847f80a66bb", "gender": 2, "id": 125192, "name": "Antal P\u00e1ger", "order": 5, "profile_path": "/theqKHTgHYL62dU5xodT5a7zAE8.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 15, "character": "Narrator", "credit_id": "52fe44b9c3a36847f80a66bf", "gender": 2, "id": 586274, "name": "Darvas Iv\u00e1n", "order": 6, "profile_path": "/ua24yKAM24dp9PwcdLW2L4XYvhS.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 16, "character": "S\u00f3sk\u00fati, g\u00e9p\u00e9sz", "credit_id": "5497c1ec92514132ed005bf0", "gender": 0, "id": 125196, "name": "J\u00e1nos Rajz", "order": 7, "profile_path": "/6kvJPzxgrsdzcgYzkO1ZXl9O14c.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 17, "character": "", "credit_id": "5497c20692514173150029c2", "gender": 1, "id": 1402407, "name": "Ter\u00e9z Bod", "order": 8, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 18, "character": "L\u0151rincke", "credit_id": "5497c22ec3a3686ae9007bac", "gender": 2, "id": 1177343, "name": "\u00c1rp\u00e1d Gyenge", "order": 9, "profile_path": "/qoBVsbqAMbNuciLC85kDHA6PYal.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 19, "character": "", "credit_id": "5497c244c3a3680511000be9", "gender": 0, "id": 1402408, "name": "S\u00e1ndor Szemere", "order": 10, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 20, "character": "", "credit_id": "5497c271c3a368054b000c30", "gender": 0, "id": 1402409, "name": "G\u00e1bor Torday", "order": 11, "profile_path": null}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe44b8c3a36847f80a6685", "department": "Writing", "gender": 2, "id": 55969, "job": "Screenplay", "name": "Zolt\u00e1n F\u00e1bri", "profile_path": "/7vJaFMt9miqQRKMTAw72W7QwJvg.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "52fe44b8c3a36847f80a667f", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 55969, "job": "Director", "name": "Zolt\u00e1n F\u00e1bri", "profile_path": "/7vJaFMt9miqQRKMTAw72W7QwJvg.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "52fe44b8c3a36847f80a668b", "department": "Camera", "gender": 2, "id": 56290, "job": "Director of Photography", "name": "Gy\u00f6rgy Ill\u00e9s", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe44b9c3a36847f80a66b7", "department": "Sound", "gender": 0, "id": 56291, "job": "Original Music Composer", "name": "Andr\u00e1s Mih\u00e1ly", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe44b8c3a36847f80a66a5", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 56297, "job": "Novel", "name": "Istv\u00e1n \u00d6rk\u00e9ny", "profile_path": "/xRUUuAvkFE5YJM7mo8R1aRuHMZM.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "52fe44b8c3a36847f80a66ab", "department": "Editing", "gender": 1, "id": 56305, "job": "Editor", "name": "Ferencn\u00e9 Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9nyi", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe44b9c3a36847f80a66b1", "department": "Art", "gender": 2, "id": 1038611, "job": "Production Design", "name": "J\u00f3zsef Romv\u00e1ri", "profile_path": null}]}}
