A \"dissection of the male psyche\", the production commanded a large of amount of Greek press attention, not least for its open references to homosexuality. 2 proved a commercial success; its run was extended twice and over 100,000 tickets were sold in total. The work seems to draw upon a range of influences, including the work of Jean Genet, Rene Magritte and Robert Wilson. Inspiration for the show also came partly from Papaioannou's experiences as a gay man in Greece. Contemporary magazine described 2 as an \"inspiring\" work that \"captures the zeitgeist\".", "popularity": 0.6, "poster_path": null, "production_companies": [{"id": 118939, "logo_path": null, "name": "HAOS Films", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GR", "name": "Greece"}], "release_date": "2007-12-11", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 96, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "el", "name": "\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "2", "video": true, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 0, "character": "", "credit_id": "547dbef2c3a3685af30049b5", "gender": 0, "id": 1392802, "name": "Altin Huta", "order": 1, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 1, "character": "", "credit_id": "547dbefb9251412d6d0055fc", "gender": 2, "id": 929254, "name": "George Kopsidas", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/1EASaekUomrf2RBsD3WDPU0kmOI.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "", "credit_id": "547dbf0bc3a3685af0005e1e", "gender": 0, "id": 1392804, "name": "Euripides Laskaridis", "order": 3, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "", "credit_id": "547dbf14c3a3685af9004dcd", "gender": 2, "id": 1392806, "name": "Drosos Skotis", "order": 4, "profile_path": "/koRYjT7Jfm0SrLTopsPW1BYSp3b.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "547dbfdbc3a3685af0005e39", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1351129, "job": "Director", "name": "Dimitris Papaioannou", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "547dbf5cc3a3685b00005e20", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 1351129, "job": "Writer", "name": "Dimitris Papaioannou", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5bb5cfda9251410ddd00a756", "department": "Sound", "gender": 2, "id": 1392819, "job": "Original Music Composer", "name": "Konstantinos Vita", "profile_path": null}]}}
