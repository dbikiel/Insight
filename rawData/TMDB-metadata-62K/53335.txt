It quickly moves from the crash victim into a candy striper. Among the patients at the hospital are some rather short high school basketball players. It is through them that we watch the events unfold. The infected, or inhabited, candy striper becomes predatory. She goes after men for sex and after women to spread. Infected women develop an incredible sweet tooth and devour anything sweet they can find. The horror then spreads. As the horror takes over more of the hospital and the CDC locks it down, the basketball players and a few friends do everything they can to try and get out of the hospital. But soon it becomes evident that the problem has spread too far. Now if they manage to escape it will only be to delay the inevitable if they cannot halt the spread of aliens before they get out and take over the whole world.", "popularity": 6.492, "poster_path": "/mOmojlfiVGL3npcNnq2Q0SxhH8H.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 23632, "logo_path": null, "name": "Snowfall Films", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 46198, "logo_path": null, "name": "Wind Chill Films", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 26249, "logo_path": null, "name": "Bay Bridge Productions Inc.", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2006-06-27", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 89, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "They're Running Out Of Patients", "title": "Candy Stripers", "video": false, "vote_average": 3.6, "vote_count": 15, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 572, "name": "sex"}, {"id": 156389, "name": "diabetic"}, {"id": 176740, "name": "candy striper"}, {"id": 176745, "name": "blind girl"}, {"id": 176746, "name": "basketball team"}, {"id": 176752, "name": "basketball player"}, {"id": 187056, "name": "woman director"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/xOGEw8iywxcFMolV6SF6YdTdJTb.jpg", "genre_ids": [10402, 10749], "id": 52371, "original_language": "nl", "original_title": "LelleBelle", "overview": "19-year old Belle practices playing the violin diligently, but is unable to impart her music with a sensitive undertone.
