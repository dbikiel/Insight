Gospel music also walked in step with the story of African-American culture \u2013 from slavery, hardscrabble rural existence and plantation work, the exodus to major cities, the Depression, World War II, to the civil rights movement and empowerment. REJOICE AND SHOUT connects the history of African-American culture with Gospel as it first impacted popular culture at large \u2013 and continues to do so. Years in the making, REJOICE AND SHOUT captures so much of what is special about this music and African-American Christianity \u2013 the sermonizing, the heartfelt testimonials, getting \u201cslain in the spirit,\u201d the hard hollerin\u2019, and of course the inspiring music.
