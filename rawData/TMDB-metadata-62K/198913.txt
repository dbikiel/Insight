From the attractions of the West Coast including Disneyland to the skyscrapers of New York, Reichenbach is curious about everything. A prison rodeo (later to come under closer and more critical scrutiny in the '90s), culturally and ethnically mixed neighborhoods, religions outside the mainstream, ghost towns, and the unique world of the American teen are all given a peek. These views of the U.S. are informative though absent of critical analysis.", "popularity": 1.124, "poster_path": "/fEaLZfDSQELxWttU66s5AYmNPBB.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1960-06-08", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "America As Seen By a Frenchman", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4d8a9251416c91119cff", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 1146725, "job": "Director", "name": "Fran\u00e7ois Reichenbach", "profile_path": null}]}}
