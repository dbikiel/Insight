He enlists the help of the Duchess of Burwood (Alcoholic Aristocrat played by Rose Alba) as a teacher and Hector (Cockney Geezer played by Nosher Powell) as fitness instructor. A probation officer friend supplies the first batch of pupils fresh from Holloway prison via a clapped out old mini bus. Suspicious neighbours and police together with newspaper reports naming the prison girls now hobnobbing in high society results in a raid and new court appearance for Lord Wingate. The Judge sentences him but plots to start up his own 'school for sex'.", "popularity": 2.213, "poster_path": "/ws917IRBmYBJnAtZrVscf1vj5mt.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1969-01-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 77, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "The went to learn about love the easy way!", "title": "School for Sex", "video": false, "vote_average": 3.6, "vote_count": 4, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 2, "character": "Giles Wingate", "credit_id": "52fe4b769251416c75103979", "gender": 2, "id": 139688, "name": "Derek Aylward", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/6nM0oXGe12UZ5PcSg2qmeAinF33.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "Countess of Burwash", "credit_id": "52fe4b769251416c7510397d", "gender": 1, "id": 990420, "name": "Rose Alba", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/91iNqlDtDHffqYUS94nl2M8eT1L.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Sgt.
