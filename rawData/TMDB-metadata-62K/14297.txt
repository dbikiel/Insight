He describes his astonishment that, at the start of the 21st century, religious faith is gaining ground in the face of rational, scientific truth. Science, based on scepticism, investigation and evidence, must continuously test its own concepts and claims. Faith, by definition, defies evidence: it is untested and unshakeable, and is therefore in direct contradiction with science.  In addition, though religions preach morality, peace and hope, in fact, says Dawkins, they bring intolerance, violence and destruction. The growth of extreme fundamentalism in so many religions across the world not only endangers humanity but, he argues, is in conflict with the trend over thousands of years of history for humanity to progress to become more enlightened and more tolerant.", "popularity": 5.61, "poster_path": "/tpvE6cNPNaCUZIHHtL2a0e3gpLq.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}, {"iso_3166_1": "IL", "name": "Israel"}, {"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}, {"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "2006-01-09", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 93, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Root of All Evil?", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.7, "vote_count": 35, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 161198, "name": "skepticism"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 11881, "video": false, "vote_count": 341, "vote_average": 7.4, "title": "Miracle on 34th Street", "release_date": "1947-06-11", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Miracle on 34th Street", "genre_ids": [35, 18, 10751], "backdrop_path": "/i90947b0zLbH1P4qjAxqiQdRfiZ.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Kris Kringle, seemingly the embodiment of Santa Claus, is asked to portray the jolly old fellow at Macy's following his performance in the Thanksgiving Day parade.
