The scene is an actual one, showing Mr. Edison in working dress engaged in an interesting chemical experiment in his great Laboratory. There is sufficient movement to lead the spectator through the several processes of mixing, pouring, testing, etc. as if he were side by side with the principal. The lights and shadows are vivid, and the apparatus and other accessories complete a startling picture that will appeal to every beholder.\u201d (Edison Catalog)", "poster_path": "/movfhAfTwEFnCoLacLsaAPUzk1g.jpg", "release_date": "1897-05-31", "title": "Mr. Edison at Work in His Chemical Laboratory", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.1, "vote_count": 18, "popularity": 1.262}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/tj7xXnxWjqlSAPu7aNzo9zHCWyU.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 10402], "id": 43594, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Emperor Jones", "overview": "Unscrupulously ambitious ,Brutus Jones escapes from jail after killing a guard and, through bluff and bravado, finds himself the emperor of a Caribbean island.", "poster_path": "/6qZ2b5MF0D1gN4cxEfq103QjKg1.jpg", "release_date": "1933-09-29", "title": "The Emperor Jones", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 9, "popularity": 2.22}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 212101, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Midnight Party", "overview": "Part of The Children's Trilogy.

While he was running the film, though, he noticed how beautiful the colored strips of film looked as they ran through the projector. So, he turned a camera on the projector and filmed the colored film gorgeously winding its way through the projector's machinery.\" - Noel Black, Colorado Springs Independent", "poster_path": "/jQCMXLYezcKSdDFk74hhzKypomb.jpg", "release_date": "1971-12-31", "title": "Color Film", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 11, "popularity": 1.244}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [27, 35], "id": 105303, "original_language": "xx", "original_title": "Explosion of a Motor Car", "overview": "An early trick film where a car explodes and parts keep falling out of the sky onto a bystander.", "poster_path": "/wi8sxMp2kDVnleYl3o71NIDPh7q.jpg", "release_date": "1900-07-01", "title": "Explosion of a Motor Car", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.8, "vote_count": 16, "popularity": 1.491}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 146565, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Rip Passing Over the Mountain", "overview": "", "poster_path": "/nu4gXbaLSOXXcZ5hhG3uHSFOnhX.jpg", "release_date": "1896-09-30", "title": "Rip Passing Over the Mountain", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.5, "vote_count": 14, "popularity": 2.203}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 146808, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Scratch and Crow", "overview": "Scratch and Crow is a student film by Helen Hill made at the California Institute of the Arts.
