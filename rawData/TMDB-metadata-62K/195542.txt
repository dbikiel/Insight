Arriving at the scene of desolation shortly after the storm had swept over the city, our party succeeded, at the risk of life and limb, in taking about a thousand feet of motion pictures, although Galveston was under martial law and photographers were shot down at sight by the excited police. The series, taken as a whole, gives a definite idea of the most terrible disaster since the Johnstown flood of 1889.", "popularity": 0.673, "poster_path": null, "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1900-09-21", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 1, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Bird's-Eye View of Dock Front, Galveston", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4d149251416c91109f57", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 1173774, "job": "Director", "name": "Albert E.
