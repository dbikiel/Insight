Rather than work with Turek, Ot\u00edk decides to accept an offer of employment in Prague, but finds he does not fit in to the city life. After discovering that the transfer of Ot\u00edk to Prague was a trick by a crooked politician to get a deal on Ot\u00edk's large inherited house, P\u00e1vek agrees to give Ot\u00edk a second chance and retrieves him from the city to resume their work together.", "popularity": 3.662, "poster_path": "/zHliFDhZ9brANaN0ND7DCGT7I9H.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 101956, "logo_path": null, "name": "Fifth Group", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 1931, "logo_path": null, "name": "Filmov\u00e9 Studio Barrandov", "origin_country": "XC"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CZ", "name": "Czech Republic"}], "release_date": "1985-08-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 98, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "cs", "name": "\u010cesk\u00fd"}, {"iso_639_1": "sk", "name": "Sloven\u010dina"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "My Sweet Little Village", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.8, "vote_count": 32, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/t3l9aooChyt4VtDAeIWkbFd5gtG.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 10751], "id": 25907, "original_language": "cs", "original_title": "Sn\u011b\u017eenky a mach\u0159i", "overview": "A quarter century after the release of the original film, this sequel brings us a drama about platonic love, life retrospective and memories.
