Describing the enormous success of that telecast, Cyril Ritchard (Captain Hook) noted \"...it was not just a TV performance, it was a stage production brought to the cameras.\" A year later, in preparation for the second PETER PAN live telecast, essentially the same cast reunited for several performances at the Ambassador Theater in New York City for invited audiences of children. This gave the 1956 telecast the same fresh theatrical quality as the first.", "poster_path": "/aAqtZBIM7guHaj2INN1OeBENuXg.jpg", "release_date": "1956-01-09", "title": "Peter Pan", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.3, "vote_count": 16, "popularity": 2.747}, {"id": 141423, "video": false, "vote_count": 40, "vote_average": 5.7, "title": "The Legend of Mor'du", "release_date": "2012-11-13", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Legend of Mor'du", "genre_ids": [16, 10751], "backdrop_path": "/msvcbZnT7EXU3nk8SqyjWsf1aep.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "The witch from Pixar's Brave uses magical illustrations to tell the legend of a power-obsessed prince who sought a magic spell that would allow him to wrest control of a kingdom from his brothers, only to destroy that kingdom and his own fate as well.", "poster_path": "/8FKR6880g0JRiblbTQEijGlq3Qj.jpg", "popularity": 6.307}, {"id": 512218, "video": false, "vote_count": 19, "vote_average": 6.1, "title": "Transformer", "release_date": "2018-04-27", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Transformer", "genre_ids": [99], "backdrop_path": null, "adult": false, "overview": "In the summer of 2015, former US Marine and world record weightlifter Matt \"Kroc\" Kroczaleski was publicly outed as being transgender.
