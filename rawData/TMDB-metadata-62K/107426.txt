The film echoes this ambiguous situation in its dialectical poetic style, interweaving the daily life reality (of 1963) with the history of the city and changing from black and white to colour, finally leaving us with hopeful perspective for the children who are playing on the stairs and hills of this beautiful town.", "poster_path": "/cbQiSPZ2S1SZqHFuH4k1ISGwuDZ.jpg", "release_date": "1963-06-07", "title": "Valparaiso", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.5, "vote_count": 13, "popularity": 2.137}, {"id": 190659, "video": false, "vote_count": 15, "vote_average": 5.3, "title": "The Terrible Eruption of Mount Pelee and Destruction of St. Pierre, Martinique", "release_date": "1902-10-23", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "\u00c9ruption volcanique \u00e0 la Martinique", "genre_ids": [], "backdrop_path": null, "adult": false, "overview": "This picture depicts the eruption of the volcano by which over 30,000 souls were hurled into eternity.
