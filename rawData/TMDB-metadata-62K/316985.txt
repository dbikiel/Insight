There she meets Donald's upstairs neighbors, his ex-fianc\u00e9e Cynthia and her father, roguish David Slader. Both men are determined to bed the young woman, but they quickly discover Patty is more interested in engaging in spirited discussions about the pressing moral and sexual issues of the day than surrendering her virginity to either one of them. After resisting their amorous advances throughout the night, Patty leaves and returns to the Empire State Building, where Donald finds her and proposes marriage.", "popularity": 0.88, "poster_path": "/hqeRVigcGH1juSPEeSJrIIy3XgC.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1953-12-16", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Girl on The Roof", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "Donald Gresham", "credit_id": "54b1a34392514107e000136e", "gender": 2, "id": 37777, "name": "Hardy Kr\u00fcger", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/mCAYIY4DDIaYnCEoGdRL7t1sw4Z.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "David Slader", "credit_id": "54b1a356c3a3680939002cf3", "gender": 2, "id": 47352, "name": "Johannes Heesters", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/apoldT6v1s7WvCgHzie3U3kq06V.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "Patty O'Neill", "credit_id": "54b1a37292514114a2000144", "gender": 1, "id": 51126, "name": "Johanna Matz", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/g6yDVBVkA02OUkqm021X0xKMu3f.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Michael O'Neill", "credit_id": "54b1a387925141746c00271c", "gender": 2, "id": 19414, "name": "Tom Tully", "order": 4, "profile_path": "/reBpi3E34yudxU7mxtiZBolJovi.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Cynthia Slader", "credit_id": "54b1a39692514107e0001375", "gender": 0, "id": 72717, "name": "Dawn Addams", "order": 5, "profile_path": "/rNQtgnahRE9y0BpFbBwbFiZpRux.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "54b1a32f925141746c002716", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 834, "job": "Director", "name": "Otto Preminger", "profile_path": "/9LIVKYnCSBox6HnWHCk3rupg9zq.jpg"}]}}
