The film follows the life of an ordinary dike keeper, J\u00f3zsef Pelik\u00e1n, who has been caught for illegally slaughtering his pig, Dezs\u00f5. Instead of doing hard time for his \"heinous\" crime, Pelik\u00e1n is elevated into an important position, generally reserved for the communist elite. His new benefactor, the mysterious Comrade Vir\u00e1g, is reluctant to reveal the real reason behind Pelik\u00e1n's preferential treatment. Thus, begins Pelik\u00e1n's hilarious adventure deep within the \"sophisticated\" communist society...
