Jhally's starting point is the breakthrough work of the late sociologist Erving Goffman, whose 1959 book The Presentation of the Self in Everyday Life prefigured the growing field of performance studies. Jhally applies Goffman's analysis of the body in print advertising to hundreds of print ads today, uncovering an astonishing pattern of regressive and destructive gender codes. By looking beyond advertising as a medium that simply sells products, and beyond analyses of gender that tend to focus on either biology or objectification, The Codes of Gender offers important insights into the social construction of masculinity and femininity, the relationship between gender and power, and the everyday performance of cultural norms.", "popularity": 1.351, "poster_path": "/kyJDDx87MQrWRpShw4ATaBppLUm.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 27072, "logo_path": null, "name": "Media Education Foundation", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2010-10-13", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 73, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "Identity and performance in popular culture", "title": "The Codes of Gender", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.9, "vote_count": 5, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 1740, "name": "pop culture"}, {"id": 3258, "name": "beauty"}, {"id": 11921, "name": "sociology"}, {"id": 15086, "name": "advertising"}, {"id": 34214, "name": "gender"}, {"id": 34221, "name": "gender roles"}, {"id": 171468, "name": "femininity"}, {"id": 190204, "name": "socialization"}, {"id": 193554, "name": "power relations"}, {"id": 194226, "name": "masculinity"}, {"id": 201063, "name": "social science"}, {"id": 201064, "name": "hierarchy"}, {"id": 201065, "name": "western society"}, {"id": 201066, "name": "social structures"}, {"id": 201067, "name": "ervig goffman"}, {"id": 201068, "name": "analysis"}, {"id": 201069, "name": "commercialism"}, {"id": 201070, "name": "gender ideals"}, {"id": 201071, "name": "ritualized cultural performance"}, {"id": 201072, "name": "objectification"}, {"id": 201073, "name": "subordination"}, {"id": 201074, "name": "infantilization"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 91356, "video": false, "vote_count": 29, "vote_average": 6.7, "title": "Comic-Con Episode IV: A Fan's Hope", "release_date": "2011-09-10", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Comic-Con Episode IV: A Fan's Hope", "genre_ids": [99], "backdrop_path": "/9jEhi26UTbZXn2QFzcYtiPyYkWB.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A behind-the-scenes look at San Diego Comic-Con, the world's largest comic book convention, and the fans who attend every year.", "poster_path": "/axltQJKHxolLfbGwuTKZZlLbBsZ.jpg", "popularity": 8.754}, {"id": 13532, "video": false, "vote_count": 500, "vote_average": 6.1, "title": "Fanboys", "release_date": "2009-02-06", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Fanboys", "genre_ids": [12, 35], "backdrop_path": "/89udmMtxl8AuQHYoFdSgB5e6xYs.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "In 1999, Star Wars fanatics take a cross-country trip to George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch so their dying friend can see a screening of The Phantom Menace before its release.", "poster_path": "/ywI92p2x7D96nuEayGVOMll35SF.jpg", "popularity": 13.772}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/oJ5LIvOKpPZvYQOOqUsRXq02L7c.jpg", "genre_ids": [99, 10751], "id": 251471, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "A LEGO Brickumentary", "overview": "A look at the global culture and appeal of the LEGO building-block toys.", "poster_path": "/4cGnjZriMY3uv11gIrMhHT4CWHV.jpg", "release_date": "2014-11-09", "title": "A LEGO Brickumentary", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 74, "popularity": 9.073}, {"id": 515841, "video": false, "vote_count": 641, "vote_average": 6.3, "title": "I Am Not an Easy Man", "release_date": "2018-04-13", "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "Je ne suis pas un homme facile", "genre_ids": [35], "backdrop_path": "/xyl9E3Bph0AZzqwwM6RFMI8WNJi.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "The chauvinist Damien wakes up in a world where women and men have their roles reversed in society, and everything is dominated by women.", "poster_path": "/jnAtRqnP4mVZZmrJd2AOtU6t1zu.jpg", "popularity": 13.115}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/5JqfbGd425PRS6BQ5MMfzT3g1Wy.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 15800, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Trekkies", "overview": "A hilarious look at the universe's most fervent fans.", "poster_path": "/bXfxkQnoq9xDegq7dmJpJXSMRYf.jpg", "release_date": "1997-10-18", "title": "Trekkies", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 32, "popularity": 6.057}, {"id": 224972, "video": false, "vote_count": 52, "vote_average": 8.2, "title": "The Mask You Live In", "release_date": "2015-01-01", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Mask You Live In", "genre_ids": [99], "backdrop_path": "/bDT2JJSVduTPvJJHtUE7EYARgT4.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Compared to girls, research shows that boys in the U.S. are more likely to be diagnosed with a behavior disorder, prescribed stimulant medications, fail out of school, binge drink, commit a violent crime, and/or take their own lives.
