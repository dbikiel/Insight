When criticism of his alienated behavior come from her and a father figure too often, he runs to the streets or to his grandmother's rural house in Virginia. Her criticism and his memories of the past both send him fleeing again to Los Angeles, where he is surrounded by superficial people who have forgotten how to be compassionate human beings. It is here that the advice of his friends and grandmother combine to transform him from an embittered ex-soldier to a strong and confident man.", "poster_path": "/dBzFEF5ashyOBOv1kaYg2bd3rzR.jpg", "release_date": "1982-11-17", "title": "Ashes and Embers", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.3, "vote_count": 4, "popularity": 2.104}, {"id": 199617, "video": false, "vote_count": 7, "vote_average": 5.8, "title": "Nat Turner: A Troublesome Property", "release_date": "2003-02-16", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Nat Turner: A Troublesome Property", "genre_ids": [99], "backdrop_path": "/8cnUfLoaPd3rmlrQAmFFDdnRLq6.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "In 1831, Nat Turner led a slave rebellion in the United States that resulted in the murder of local slave owners and their families, the eventual execution of 55 rebels and the retribution lynching of more than 200 innocent slaves. Nat Turner: A Troublesome Property examines how the story of Turner\u2019s revolt has been interpreted throughout history and how it continues to raise new questions about the nature of terrorism and other forms of violent resistance to oppression.  The film adopts an innovative structure by interspersing documentary footage and interviews with dramatizations of these different versions of Turner\u2019s story. A unique collaboration between MacArthur Genius Award feature director Charles Burnett, acclaimed historian of slavery Kenneth S. Greenberg and Academy Award-nominated documentary producer Frank Christopher, Nat Turner is a compelling look at one of history\u2019s most mysterious figures.", "poster_path": "/ojT5PRnrVMTzPWYW3cSMtmw15s8.jpg", "popularity": 2.405}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/bTVwreYdmHbXPBRldjK32V9ptJ9.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 18], "id": 61435, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Livin' Large!", "overview": "A young black reporter begins to lose his identity.", "poster_path": "/4wCKNZXRwJbuZM3kt0sjjh1NEi8.jpg", "release_date": "1991-09-20", "title": "Livin' Large!", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 8, "popularity": 2.78}, {"id": 83588, "video": false, "vote_count": 11, "vote_average": 6.5, "title": "Middle of Nowhere", "release_date": "2012-01-20", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Middle of Nowhere", "genre_ids": [18], "backdrop_path": "/f6oMZGJE1d9bzEG62dCd0Z75Ru1.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "When her husband is sentenced to eight years in prison, Ruby drops out of medical school in order to focus on her husband's well-being while he's incarcerated - leading her on a journey of self-discovery in the process.", "poster_path": "/7VXkSTd0MKhB0CJBCrd4R8zZaKh.jpg", "popularity": 3.216}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/8kazHaW6zDnRO8jMq2zPfcO0Cw8.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 10749], "id": 51970, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "I'm Through with White Girls", "overview": "Jay Brooks is that black guy who digs indie rock, graphic novels, and dates white chicks.
