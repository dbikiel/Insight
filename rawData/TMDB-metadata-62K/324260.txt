Nat Turner: A Troublesome Property examines how the story of Turner\u2019s revolt has been interpreted throughout history and how it continues to raise new questions about the nature of terrorism and other forms of violent resistance to oppression.  The film adopts an innovative structure by interspersing documentary footage and interviews with dramatizations of these different versions of Turner\u2019s story. A unique collaboration between MacArthur Genius Award feature director Charles Burnett, acclaimed historian of slavery Kenneth S. Greenberg and Academy Award-nominated documentary producer Frank Christopher, Nat Turner is a compelling look at one of history\u2019s most mysterious figures.", "poster_path":
