But central for the plot are three persons: a male waiter who is never named (here called W), the female waiter Anna, and \"the count\", a self-invented nickname by a man cleaning plates. The count is skilled in making others do what he wants. Half a dozen of the personnel assist in a poorly planned and failed attempt to liberate a man whom the police move from one arrest to another. The event involves stealing a motorcycle and threatening policemen with a gun. Anna strongly tries to make contact with W. Finally it turns out that she need his help to break her sexual relation to the count, a relation that from her part is not motivated by positive feelings. W rejects her attempts. And then Anna has suddenly gone. She has got a pleasant job in another town. And then W's feelings awaken.", "poster_path": "/3OQwCJmg2MR662dlld2VyGxKgMv.jpg", "release_date": "1975-11-16", "title": "Giliap", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.9, "vote_count": 10, "popularity": 2.614}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/wTr4nJkfbIzq3ZTwxaupwb3Q830.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 145147, "original_language": "ru", "original_title": "\u041a\u0440\u0443\u0433 \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439", "overview": "A man tries to come to terms with his father's death and to deal with the mundane details of his burial in a society cut off from spirituality.", "poster_path": "/A5TOMVsom8zExaCV6dDr7XMlIZq.jpg", "release_date": "1990-09-11", "title": "The Second Circle", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.4, "vote_count": 11, "popularity": 2.121}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/dID3IWs7aIrwFwq1X19lYOE3mm7.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 304081, "original_language": "sv", "original_title": "F\u00e5r\u00f6dokument 1969", "overview": "Bergman\u2019s documentary is a time machine, bringing us back to the small island of F\u00e5r\u00f6 in the late sixties.
