Not only must he navigate the usual social and academic pitfalls of high school, but he has to contend with his young twin sisters, serving as de facto parent in the absence of his deceased mother and deadbeat father. The pressure mounts when the bank calls with a foreclosure warning, and Seth's frustrations spill over into various altercations with the school football team.  An exasperated coach exiles Seth to work after school with Abel the eccentric groundskeeper (Kevin Sorbo). Their relationship starts off cold and rocky, but as the two spend more time together, they realize they have more in common than either thought. The downside: it's pretty much pain and sadness that they share. The upside: God loves them.", "popularity": 2.497, "poster_path": "/q0u3rtbqapSRHJuhfDb7K5pyq1L.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2012-09-14", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 104, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "Sometimes the heroes are on the sidelines", "title": "Abel's Field", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.7, "vote_count": 10, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "Seth McArdle", "credit_id": "52fe4c2cc3a36847f822144d", "gender": 2, "id": 1129413, "name": "Samuel Davis", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/aAOyhZjymZhIvh2HM6qL6M7P7dw.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "Abel", "credit_id": "52fe4c2cc3a36847f8221451", "gender": 2, "id": 51965, "name": "Kevin Sorbo", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/a6rDi3tkNJwaVoP7VGbdGelwtYw.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Katie", "credit_id": "567ff4ea9251412e5200b174", "gender": 0, "id": 1429567, "name": "Nicole Elliott", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/mUDTe3r9wszQJclMuUSN5veXonD.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Ms. Hern\u00e1ndez", "credit_id": "567ff504c3a36860e900c9ba", "gender": 0, "id": 1554272, "name": "Yesenia Garcia", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/eII2atOHrFLLLuedpMK9rrHqGkj.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 6, "character": "Courtney", "credit_id": "567ff517c3a3684bcc00dd13", "gender": 1, "id": 1411601, "name": "Katie Sarife", "order": 4, "profile_path": "/oQLQZ58uvGgpdtCUpOcoiF5zYJW.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4c2cc3a36847f8221457", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 1149788, "job": "Director", "name": "Gordie Haakstad", "profile_path": null}]}}
