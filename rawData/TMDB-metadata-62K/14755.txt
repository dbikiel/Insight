Dobbs is also having trouble at home with his errant wife, whom he very much loves, having frequent affairs. He's also pleased to see an old friend, Dieter Frey, who he recruited after the war. With the assistance of a colleague and a retired policeman, Dobbs tries to piece together just who is the spy and who in fact assassinated Fennan.", "popularity": 5.171, "poster_path": "/7UNbXips8TUZ1RTrRudRZ3FTRSh.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 2964, "logo_path": null, "name": "Sidney Lumet Film Productions", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "1966-05-13", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 115, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Deadly Affair", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 28, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/2oFyyidaGE00XZkNgEllX65vbdl.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 53, 9648], "id": 45888, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "A Murder of Quality", "overview": "At the request of his old war time colleague Ailsa Brimley, George Smiley agrees to look into the murder of Stella Rode.
