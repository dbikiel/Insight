BROKEN SIDE OF TIME is the story of Dolce, one of the models who've made a career of it. But now 30, and tired of competing with 18-year-olds, Dolce realizes what makes her feel most alive is also killing her. Before starting a new career behind the camera, she embarks on a long road trip home, shooting with her favorite photographers one last time, and shedding her lifestyle-acquired vices along the way. Combing real photoshoots shot cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9-style with a narrative based on some very real-life adventures in front of the lens, BROKEN SIDE OF TIME is a dark, sexual glimpse into a world never before captured in a film. A world where any woman can play the role of a model, and any man can be a photographer, and where even the best of them must consider whether the fame and money is worth the cost.", "popularity": 1.624, "poster_path": "/bUNQobUACsC2azYrGYiBcUWMKgG.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2013-06-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 126, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "When what makes you feel most alive is killing you.", "title": "Broken Side of Time", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.5, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 0, "character": "Dolce / Jane", "credit_id": "5359ebd0c3a3684780000d30", "gender": 0, "id": 558059, "name": "Lynn Mancinelli", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/rjKB3FnwfoFuahq9AtcNfFN2xye.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 1, "character": "Viral", "credit_id": "5359ebd9c3a3684780000d34", "gender": 1, "id": 1313367, "name": "Audria Ayers", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/lz6B39jltjC9OYm0x8VnWcfH0ld.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "Maggie Stinson", "credit_id": "5359ebe2c3a3684772000cc3", "gender": 0, "id": 1313368, "name": "Olivia Whelan", "order": 3, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "Alisa", "credit_id": "5359ebecc3a3684780000d39", "gender": 1, "id": 1313369, "name": "Jessica Mazo", "order": 4, "profile_path": "/3OSWEGMJcCBuRaBCu7Z2awYiF0.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Zach", "credit_id": "5359ebf3c3a3684790000da5", "gender": 0, "id": 1299436, "name": "Marcin Paluch", "order": 5, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Bathroom hookup", "credit_id": "5359ebfec3a3684799000d39", "gender": 0, "id": 558056, "name": "Alex Brown", "order": 6, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 6, "character": "Fresh", "credit_id": "5359ec09c3a36847a9000d31", "gender": 0, "id": 1313370, "name": "Monique Demopoulos", "order": 7, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 7, "character": "Guy With Camera #2", "credit_id": "5359ec15c3a3684779000d75", "gender": 0, "id": 1313371, "name": "Peter Lynch", "order": 8, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 8, "character": "Gary", "credit_id": "5359ec1cc3a3684780000d43", "gender": 0, "id": 1313372, "name": "Kevin Gilligan", "order": 9, "profile_path": null}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "5359ec2ec3a3684799000d3d", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 558062, "job": "Director", "name": "Gorman Bechard", "profile_path": "/bpwfHFX1AH9BtLA1zQkh7Nytf0K.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "5359ec3ac3a3684799000d3f", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 558062, "job": "Writer", "name": "Gorman Bechard", "profile_path": "/bpwfHFX1AH9BtLA1zQkh7Nytf0K.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "5359ec44c3a3684799000d43", "department": "Crew", "gender": 0, "id": 558059, "job": "Additional Dialogue", "name": "Lynn Mancinelli", "profile_path": "/rjKB3FnwfoFuahq9AtcNfFN2xye.jpg"}]}}
