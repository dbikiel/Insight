An otter trapped in a burrow is rescued by 10-year-old Anders and his six-year-old brother, Kjell. In secret, the boys cage the animal and finally domesticate it. They obtain food for the Otter by fishing through the ice on a frozen lake. The boys manage to keep their secret from their family. On the eve of the May Day festival, Kjell reveals to family and friends the otter's presence. Anders is so distressed that he runs into the woods with the otter. The otter breaks away and returns to its life of natural freedom.

Rouqier concentrates on a single French farm family, following them through the four seasons. As in the works of Robert Flaherty, the human characters and the land surrounding them are \"one\", and Rouqier never misses an opportunity to parallel their lives with the eons-old phases of nature. The final symbolic images of Spring, achieved through time-lapse photography, are almost unbearably beautiful. The winner of several festival awards, Farrebique nonetheless did not immediately result in an outpouring of financing for Rouqier's follow-up films (this was a common problem in the financially strapped French film industry of the 1940s). Perhaps as a result, Rouqier did not make his sequel, Biquefarre (filmed in the same region, with some of the same \"actors\"), until 1983.", "poster_path": "/rx81Dh44AxQnTtDJqrlFPptvJk5.jpg", "release_date": "1946-09-01", "title": "Farrebique, or the Four Seasons", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 1.586}], "total_pages": 2, "total_results": 22}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 2, "character": "Sigmund Freud", "credit_id": "52fe45b69251416c9103bd7f", "gender": 2, "id": 12151, "name": "Montgomery Clift", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/estinnbIcY6j45EcRWBKzY1DC9R.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "Cecily Koertner", "credit_id": "52fe45b69251416c9103bd83", "gender": 1, "id": 13326, "name": "Susannah York", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/z21rG8L8RsDOEl2iG467cWPud3T.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "le docteur Joseph Breuer", "credit_id": "52fe45b69251416c9103bd87", "gender": 2, "id": 34316, "name": "Larry Parks", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/dkk0HXspSaeX3HPRcqq8zZlAfTp.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Martha Freud", "credit_id": "52fe45b69251416c9103bd8b", "gender": 1, "id": 131742, "name": "Susan Kohner", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/eEQP12ACOi3rmC1CSWJ7EaXJ6VH.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 17, "character": "le professeur Jean-Martin Charcot", "credit_id": "52fe45b69251416c9103bdcb", "gender": 2, "id": 34583, "name": "Fernand Ledoux", "order": 4, "profile_path": "/vOsGoZOEeJdx65iFv5rz2INDTlT.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 18, "character": "Frau Ida Koertner", "credit_id": "52fe45b69251416c9103bdcf", "gender": 1, "id": 232127, "name": "Eileen Herlie", "order": 5, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 19, "character": "Carl von Schlossen", "credit_id": "52fe45b69251416c9103bdd3", "gender": 2, "id": 24813, "name": "David McCallum", "order": 6, "profile_path": "/po7qYZYW0RMTl4BavHIZCxqopCD.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 20, "character": "Frau Freud", "credit_id": "52fe45b69251416c9103bdd7", "gender": 1, "id": 39001, "name": "Rosalie Crutchley", "order": 7, "profile_path": "/3GeycPOd4LHV1tSaRErb8tHT67q.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 21, "character": "Jacob Freud", "credit_id": "52fe45b69251416c9103bddb", "gender": 2, "id": 29675, "name": "David Kossoff", "order": 8, "profile_path": "/d5xMGFITkes230NjLQ8F5u7RU3f.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 22, "character": "Herr Jacob Koertner", "credit_id": "52fe45b69251416c9103bddf", "gender": 2, "id": 10196, "name": "Joseph F\u00fcrst", "order": 9, "profile_path": "/zn5emLVEi907TNXC4Buusp370rr.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 26, "character": "Chairman of Medical Profession in Vienna", "credit_id": "5a1fda0fc3a3680b8d08b492", "gender": 2, "id": 87457, "name": "Stefan Schnabel", "order": 10, "profile_path": "/JBoPajYNk0fo2HyW1SMgNCWO0U.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 27, "character": "Nora Wimmer", "credit_id": "5a1fda2a925141032608f74c", "gender": 1, "id": 124737, "name": "Moira Redmond", "order": 11, "profile_path": "/p9wFwo4UJfjODWgcW0hdP7jrcJ8.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 28, "character": "Narrator", "credit_id": "5a1fda44925141032c08cbe6", "gender": 2, "id": 6593, "name": "John Huston", "order": 12, "profile_path": "/1YV2m0943zGmgQaHHgtFuQhOEKl.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe45b69251416c9103bd9d", "department": "Camera", "gender": 2, "id": 666, "job": "Director of Photography", "name": "Douglas Slocombe", "profile_path": "/sluvyktacpqv02GzGYRW3ZB6Qst.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "52fe45b69251416c9103bda9", "department": "Sound", "gender": 2, "id": 1760, "job": "Original Music Composer", "name": "Jerry Goldsmith", "profile_path": "/e6sd10VuwFXkgRFrCTCygbhMq2q.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "52fe45b69251416c9103bd7b", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 6593, "job": "Director", "name": "John Huston", "profile_path": "/1YV2m0943zGmgQaHHgtFuQhOEKl.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "52fe45b69251416c9103bdaf", "department": "Editing", "gender": 2, "id": 6604, "job": "Editor", "name": "Ralph Kemplen", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe45b69251416c9103bdbb", "department": "Costume & Make-Up", "gender": 1, "id": 6607, "job": "Costume Design", "name": "Doris Langley Moore", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe45b69251416c9103bdc1", "department": "Production", "gender": 2, "id": 7690, "job": "Production Manager", "name": "C.O.
