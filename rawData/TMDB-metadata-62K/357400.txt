A second Digi-Egg appears in the sky to reveal an evil digimon, Parrotmon. Agumon then Digivolves to Greymon but isn't strong enough to beat Parrotmon and is knocked out. Tai grabs Kari's whistle and wakes up Greymon, who defeats Parrotmon and disappears with him.", "poster_path": "/1LA0Eh611QCcjM7sUqfDSjSQNZx.jpg", "popularity": 11.035}], "total_pages": 1,
