In Switzerland there's a company which has developed the art to perfection - Nestl\u00e9. This company dominates the global business in bottled water. Swiss journalist Res Gehringer has investigated this money-making phenomena. Nestl\u00e9 refused to cooperate, on the pretext that it was \"the wrong film at the wrong time\".

Now, he sits on one of the upper floors of an empty bank building in the middle of Frankfurt, overlooking a skyline of glass and steel. And talks. In an extended mix of a monologue and an in-depth interview, which is as frightening as it is fascinating, he shares his inside knowledge from a megalomaniac parallel world where illusions are the market's hardest currency. Marc Bauder's 'Master of the Universe' is based on meticulous research and provides us with geniune insight into the notoriously secretive and self-protective 'universe' of which our nameless protagonist experiences himself a master. Where other films on the financial meltdown have focused on the epic nature of larger-than-life business, Bauder probes the mentality that made it possible in the first place. A tense drama where psychology meets finance - two things that are more closely linked than you would like to believe.", "poster_path": "/Aav3aRcU2470zul1MOgLW509mw1.jpg", "release_date": "2013-11-07", "title": "Master of the Universe", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.3, "vote_count": 20, "popularity": 1.464}, {"id": 13294, "video": false, "vote_count": 15, "vote_average": 6.8, "title": "The Story of Little Mook", "release_date": "1953-12-23", "original_language": "de", "original_title": "Die Geschichte vom kleinen Muck", "genre_ids": [14, 10751], "backdrop_path": "/9hTEdGBxqI8XvO4kEQSYR2iMQVq.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "An old man living in an oriental city tells the story of his life to a group of kids: He too was once a young boy by the name of Little Muck - much like them, but with better manners and a heap of problems.

Amidst the dunes of sand he comes across a small house owned by a wicked woman and her many cats.
