Sergeant Gerry Boyle is an eccentric small-town cop with a confrontational and crass personality and a subversive sense of humor. A longtime policeman in County Galway, Boyle is a maverick with his own moral code. He has seen enough of the world to know there isn't much to it and has had plenty of time to think about it. When a fellow police officer disappears and Boyle's small town becomes key to a large drug trafficking investigation, he is forced to at least feign interest when dealing with the humorless FBI agent Wendell Everett assigned to the case.", "poster_path": "/iUHePguAaumQGvf3rlXHHAkAMoh.jpg", "popularity": 15.21}, {"id": 27585, "video": false, "vote_count": 327, "vote_average": 6.8, "title": "Rabbit Hole", "release_date": "2010-12-16", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Rabbit Hole", "genre_ids": [18], "backdrop_path": "/mXKwU2ucrjMzKP2tC7ITrPp4WPz.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Life for a happy couple is turned upside down after their young son dies in an accident.", "poster_path": "/qBhDlqdLZzxqKIXO53vMjpqLgZu.jpg", "popularity": 10.675}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/fr3uHikLkQTeLfh1UeSQ1D9jY7H.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 18], "id": 118677, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Why Stop Now?", "overview": "When a college piano prodigy tries to check his mother into rehab, he is taken hostage by her drug dealer and swept along on a wild adventure.", "poster_path": "/jmvlLJMNVF0FmvNcnDCh0UnUaoO.jpg", "release_date": "2012-08-17", "title": "Why Stop Now?", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.6, "vote_count": 55, "popularity": 6.508}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/tb9YVWwfVFNUlTAZ6Rjg32g18bt.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 36, 10752], "id": 28089, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Messenger", "overview": "Will Montgomery (Ben Foster), a U.S. Army Staff Sergeant who has returned home from Iraq, is assigned to the Army\u2019s Casualty Notification service.
