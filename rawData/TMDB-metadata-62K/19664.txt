Bill Grice (David Niven) and some of his former soldiers. On the pretext of being on a fishing expedition, these seemingly drunken old men in civilian clothing must board and destroy 3 Nazi ships, whose radio transmissions have resulted in Nazi submarines sinking allied ships. While Stewart arranges a diversion on shore, Pugh and Grice carry out the dangerous raid on and destruction of the Nazi ships.", "popularity": 7.873, "poster_path": "/kb1YjjKpCrqqsmJDXnlbieJ3wC6.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 898, "logo_path": "/pBh5kde6mhGEMglYLwCdFnqK5zh.png", "name": "Lorimar Productions", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 21858, "logo_path": null, "name": "Richmond Light Horse Productions", "origin_country": "GB"}, {"id": 21859, "logo_path": null, "name": "Varius Entertainment Trading A.G.", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1980-07-03", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 120, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "The Last Charge of the Calcutta Light Horse", "title": "The Sea Wolves", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.9, "vote_count": 40, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 502, "name": "ambush"}, {"id": 658, "name": "sea"}, {"id": 1956, "name": "world war ii"}, {"id": 9672, "name": "based on a true story"}, {"id": 14643, "name": "battle"}, {"id": 160855, "name": "naval"}, {"id": 207883, "name": "1940s"}, {"id": 208878, "name": "british intelligence"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/qtD2lFLG5T7L8flbKSEIoSqcslI.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 10752], "id": 7862, "original_language": "de", "original_title": "Die F\u00e4lscher", "overview": "The story Jewish counterfeiter, Salomon Sorowitsch, coerced into assisting the Nazi operation of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp during World War II.", "poster_path": "/bRQddrgVemZtFdnrPy9AxTpkhpj.jpg", "release_date": "2007-02-09", "title": "The Counterfeiters", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.4, "vote_count": 261, "popularity": 8.902}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/pKawqrtCBMmxarft7o1LbEynys7.jpg", "genre_ids": [10752, 18, 28], "id": 228150, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Fury", "overview": "In the last months of World War II, as the Allies make their final push in the European theatre, a battle-hardened U.S. Army sergeant named 'Wardaddy' commands a Sherman tank called 'Fury' and its five-man crew on a deadly mission behind enemy lines.
