The show originally had a 4 week run, which was extended twice due to the popularity of the performance. Later released as his first video, titled \"Live at the Ambassadors\", the show lead to Izzard being invited to the Just For Laughs Montreal Comedy Festival, awarded a British Comedy Award for \"Top Stand Up Comedian\", and receiving an Olivier Award nomination for \"Outstanding Achievement\". Live at the Ambassadors is an example of Izzard's very early and less refined style of stand up. His bizarre sense of humour has remained the same throughout performances, and various themes and ideas that can be seen in later recordings can be identified in Live at the Ambassadors.", "poster_path": "/sonUxBASZNKBfqU7SKMJCJlwKB2.jpg", "release_date": "1993-01-01", "title": "Eddie Izzard: Live at the Ambassadors", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 7, "popularity": 3.678}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/lC21GKccfWtPoguonQfg2ZdehwD.jpg", "genre_ids": [35], "id": 21576, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Bill Maher: Be More Cynical", "overview": "BE MORE CYNICAL was originally aired on HBO, and offers viewers a chance to see Maher's full routine, which sees him tackling a wide array of topics, and leaving the audience recoiling in laughter.", "poster_path": "/6KRxspzHMj0sg5QvqtmW7QrQZmF.jpg", "release_date": "2000-06-10", "title": "Bill Maher: Be More Cynical", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.9, "vote_count": 12, "popularity": 5.456}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/uhf2Q7QuLsYdOnkjGg3Jaod1naV.jpg", "genre_ids": [35], "id": 110549, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Hannibal Buress: Animal Furnace", "overview": "Hannibal is a Chicago native, currently living in New York City where he regularly performs and lives alone with no pets.
