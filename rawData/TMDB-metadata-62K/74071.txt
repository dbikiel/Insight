Gogol's story deals with Toma, a reluctant theology student who is forced to read the Psalms over an (un)dead girl for three nights in a row. All the while supernatural forces are trying to grab him from the Holy Circle drawn on the church floor. Kadijevic adapts and enriches 'Viy' by inventing a new backstory for the witch-girl and her father. The dead girl, Catherine (unwittingly killed in the prologue, while in the shape of a hag), is referred to as a 'saint' and her father is a harsh and unpleasant man. Kadijevic departs further from the original story, and introduces an excess of perversity and horror more reminiscent of the Anglo-American gothic than the milder Slavic attempts in a similar mode.", "poster_path": "/y7dXtxdMLlBKvv6YRhi02JU8Jg4.jpg", "release_date": "1990-09-29", "title": "A Holy Place", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 8, "popularity": 1.4}, {"id": 64992, "video": false, "vote_count": 12, "vote_average": 6.4, "title": "Human Lanterns", "release_date": "1982-07-14", "original_language": "zh", "original_title": "Ren pi deng long", "genre_ids": [28, 27], "backdrop_path": "/8uaEZMUvWZukMgTDWBCTWeaYmfa.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "This is it: one of the most talked about cult films ever made -- a maniacal masterpiece of the macabre, the martial arts, and the just plain weird.
