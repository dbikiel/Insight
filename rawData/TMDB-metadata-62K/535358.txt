With their trademark comic mayhem, expect hilarious stunts, chaos, technical hitches, flying mishaps and cast disputes on the way to Neverland with hilarious and disastrous results.", "poster_path": "/AlqhK60wK5W6OwszRbNQPveDhHQ.jpg", "release_date": "2016-12-31", "title": "Peter Pan Goes Wrong", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.3, "vote_count": 24, "popularity": 4.035}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/2VKjd1JRLR93cvBqP4fqLmPgdXP.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 10402, 10749, 10770], "id": 15199, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Rent: Filmed Live on Broadway", "overview": "Rent: Filmed Live on Broadway is a 2008 film of the final performance of the original Broadway production of the musical Rent on September 7, 2008, with some footage of the closing night celebration.
