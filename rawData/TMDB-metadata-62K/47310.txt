Robeson committed his support to Paul Strand and Leo Hurwitz\u2019s political semidocumentary Native Land. With Robeson\u2019s narration and songs, this beautifully shot and edited film exposes violations of Americans\u2019 civil liberties and is a call to action for exploited workers around the country. Scarcely shown since its debut, Native Land represents Robeson\u2019s shift from narrative cinema to the leftist documentaries that would define the final chapter of his controversial film career.", "poster_path": "/xdI7oIeL9aYBWK60gLt9AUAXjPU.jpg", "release_date": "1942-05-11", "title": "Native Land", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.4, "vote_count": 7, "popularity": 2.374}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/AaWTAAuofsJFFDmsoCMnPbYupkU.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 36], "id": 84274, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Disraeli", "overview": "Prime Minister of Great Britain Benjamin Disraeli outwits the subterfuge of the Russians and chicanery at home in order to secure the purchase of the Suez Canal.", "poster_path": "/eVJpfh42k1SXkwyAQGzEdM3xSvf.jpg", "release_date": "1929-11-01", "title": "Disraeli", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.9, "vote_count": 7, "popularity": 3.419}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/xUtmO7pDhDYdxBcfuEpYgaENSL5.jpg", "genre_ids": [35], "id": 186268, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Angels in Disguise", "overview": "Slip and the gang (Bowery Boys) stray from newspaper work to detective work.", "poster_path": "/zzhtLkTvvbLxaOxsnXFVb59skxV.jpg", "release_date": "1949-09-25", "title": "Angels in Disguise", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.7, "vote_count": 3, "popularity": 3.127}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/vv4qI01lpbuN19VKLDq3AWsYFDK.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 36, 10749, 37], "id": 233117, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Gold Is Where You Find It", "overview": "Colonel Ferris, a wealthy farmer in northern California, is strongly opposed to hydraulic mining, a new method developed during the gold rush of the 1870's, which is flooding the area's prosperous farmlands.
