After a tragic accident, Ian Fletcher, a 15-year old Floridian, moves far north to live with his aunt and uncle. Shortly after his arrival, Ian is shipped off to Camp Manna, a backwoods Evangelical Christian camp soaked in baffling religious sub-culture. Camp Manna is centered around the God Games, a Biblically-themed Olympiad focused on turning boys into \"men of faith\". But as a \"nonbeliever\", this is the last place in the world that Ian wants to spend a week. He is bunked up with the Passover Privates, the cabin of outcasts and misfits, and their zealous, un-cool counselor Bradley Sommers. But when Ian is introduced to Clayton Vance, the savvy and chiseled counselor of the Righteous Regiment, he has one focus: Ditch Bradley and join up with Clayton.", "popularity": 0.84, "poster_path": "/odqXgjozzM05RTHlyR4b0H1lSgp.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2018-06-05", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 91, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Camp Manna", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 0, "character": "Jack Cujo Parrish", "credit_id": "5b252ad99251410d54005e38", "gender": 2, "id": 2048, "name": "Gary Busey", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/n66ycv61ZoqusHthcQde1g3JY6T.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 1, "character": "Clayton Vance", "credit_id": "5b252aeec3a36841f0006c75", "gender": 2, "id": 1304335, "name": "Jimmy Tatro", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/ponYRa1b0oDQz5PHd5CLsXrKf9r.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "Gordo", "credit_id": "5b252af89251410d5c006298", "gender": 0, "id": 1326885, "name": "Joey Morgan", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/56BmgVznw18DdJIoBzAJuvuT4qD.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "Militant Counselor", "credit_id": "5b252b08c3a36841f3006751", "gender": 2, "id": 1585127, "name": "Brett Johnson", "order": 4, "profile_path": "/bHEuH4YsCgdGTzlCOGQUl3V4mTE.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Ian Fletcher", "credit_id": "5b252b1d0e0a26670d006526", "gender": 2, "id": 967781, "name": "Luke Kleintank", "order": 5, "profile_path": "/vIS6KZfeOeaZzTA2hhV6gVU43jA.jpg"}], "crew": []}}
