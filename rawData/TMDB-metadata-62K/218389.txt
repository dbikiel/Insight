At least that was producer Pandro S. Berman's reasoning when he cast Pons in the 1935 musical romance I Dream too Much. The actress plays Annette, a rural French musical student who marries struggling American composer Jonathan (Henry Fonda). Possessed of a splendid singing voice, our heroine rises to fame on the opera stage, while poor Jonathan continues struggling, supporting himself as a tour guide. Annette eventually saves her marriage by transforming her husband's \"masterpiece,\" a rather turgid modernistic opera, into a light-hearted musical comedy. Lucille Ball, who'd later co-star with Henry Fonda in The Big Street and Yours, Mine and Ours, has a funny minor role as a gum-snapping tourist. Though Lily Pons was at least 10 years older than Fonda, they make an attractive and believable screen couple, adding credibility to this somewhat contrived yarn", "popularity": 2.605, "poster_path": "/uLOcnN1Zv3sKQDVQ5hux96FKH5d.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 6, "logo_path": "/n53F7K9scQWFXYbrCablqLKqJdp.png", "name": "RKO Radio Pictures", "origin_country": "US"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1935-11-29", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 97, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "I Dream Too Much", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.6, "vote_count": 5, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 90, "name": "paris, france"}, {"id": 2199, "name": "opera"}, {"id": 4344, "name": "musical"}, {"id": 162262, "name": "movie star"}, {"id": 209406, "name": "cabaret performer"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 342473, "video": false, "vote_count": 1168, "vote_average": 7.1, "title": "Ballerina", "release_date": "2016-12-14", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Ballerina", "genre_ids": [12, 16, 35, 10751], "backdrop_path": "/wlLdcK3Sm7zp0w1ZuVvnFlmcchM.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Set in 1879 Paris.
