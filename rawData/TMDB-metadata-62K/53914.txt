The final symbolic images of Spring, achieved through time-lapse photography, are almost unbearably beautiful. The winner of several festival awards, Farrebique nonetheless did not immediately result in an outpouring of financing for Rouqier's follow-up films (this was a common problem in the financially strapped French film industry of the 1940s). Perhaps as a result, Rouqier did not make his sequel, Biquefarre (filmed in the same region, with some of the same \"actors\"), until 1983.", "poster_path": "/rx81Dh44AxQnTtDJqrlFPptvJk5.jpg", "release_date": "1946-09-01", "title": "Farrebique, or the Four Seasons", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 1.139}, {"id": 181537, "video": false, "vote_count": 6, "vote_average": 7.2, "title": "The Late George Apley", "release_date": "1947-03-19", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Late George Apley", "genre_ids": [35], "backdrop_path": "/cL9w1xal7hmfkPmfKioHX4dOblA.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "George and Catherine Apley of Boston lead a proper life in the proper social circle, as did the Apleys before them.
