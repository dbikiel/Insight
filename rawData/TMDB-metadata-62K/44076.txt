He's working on a documentary, for Japanese TV, on Iranian burial practices. On the anniversary of his wife's death, a hitchhiker tells him a story of spousal abuse and infant mortality, he discovers that someone has been buried in his plot next to his wife, and he needs the help of his attorney, a well-connected fixer. He dreams of death, even as he investigates it for his film. His niece's husband, a well-known writer, fails to return home; he searches hospitals for an unclaimed body. His heart disease is flaring up. Is he prepared for death? Is that all that's left?", "popularity": 1.4, "poster_path": "/q2Oruub4itcHD71CBDqmrRppUDK.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 23698, "logo_path": null, "name": "Hedayat Film", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "IR", "name": "Iran"}], "release_date": "2000-09-08", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 93, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fa", "name": "\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Smell of Camphor, Fragrance of Jasmine", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 197057, "name": "fragrance"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 3, "character": "Bahman Farjami", "credit_id": "59c21383925141768a009005", "gender": 0, "id": 1081566, "name": "Bahman Farmanara", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/yb1J03NkD1P71M8Nh8Ohgctbe56.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Farzaneh", "credit_id": "59c2138f92514176910089fd", "gender": 0, "id": 1418891, "name": "Parivash Nazarieh", "order": 2, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Dr. Arasteh (The Attorney)", "credit_id": "59c213a0c3a3682caf0084bc", "gender": 2, "id": 1433731, "name": "Reza Kianian", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/jcB2AtpV5WWa5yBVpfcr6Hn7Ztz.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 6, "character": "Woman Hitch-Hiker", "credit_id": "59c213ac925141768a009024", "gender": 1, "id": 1074044, "name": "Roya Nonahali", "order": 4, "profile_path": "/yr33nsJB2DiZQHkVPesj45adwun.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 7, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "59c213bd92514176ad008ed7", "gender": 0, "id": 1098646, "name": "Mohammad Khatami", "order": 5, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 8, "character": "Abdollah (The Servant)", "credit_id": "59c213c9c3a3682cd100903f", "gender": 0, "id": 1098597, "name": "Hossein Kazbian", "order": 6, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 9, "character": "Bahman's Sister", "credit_id": "59c213dec3a3682ca1008dae", "gender": 0, "id": 1698408, "name": "Mahtaj Nojoomi", "order": 7, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 10, "character": "Homayouni - The Actor", "credit_id": "59c213e492514176ef008dad", "gender": 0, "id": 1517189, "name": "Valiyollah Shirandami", "order": 8, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 11, "character": "Memorial Sign Rental", "credit_id": "59c213f092514176ef008dbe", "gender": 0, "id": 1351403, "name": "Firouz Behjat-Mohamadi", "order": 9, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 12, "character": "", "credit_id": "59c213f9c3a3682cd1009067", "gender": 0, "id": 1074042, "name": "Ebrahim Abadi", "order": 10, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 13, "character": "", "credit_id": "59c213fdc3a3682c84008d53", "gender": 0, "id": 1547306, "name": "Dariush Asadzade", "order": 11, "profile_path": "/h4LCn8RV3tA50trPu19RfMYjogl.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4675c3a36847f8100389", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1081566, "job": "Director", "name": "Bahman Farmanara", "profile_path": "/yb1J03NkD1P71M8Nh8Ohgctbe56.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "59c2135a92514176ef008d2c", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 1081566, "job": "Writer", "name": "Bahman Farmanara", "profile_path": "/yb1J03NkD1P71M8Nh8Ohgctbe56.jpg"}]}}
