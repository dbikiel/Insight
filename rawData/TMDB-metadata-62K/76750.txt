Emily is eccentric to the point of dangerous and its not long before the two sisters form a battle of wills with Kev caught in the crossfire (http://forum.movie-list.com).", "poster_path": "/coHra6JO5zsDqIPfMJ5otVEfojC.jpg", "release_date": "2012-07-06", "title": "Strawberry Fields", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.3, "vote_count": 6, "popularity": 2.339}, {"id": 73129, "video": false, "vote_count": 7, "vote_average": 4.1, "title": "Johanna", "release_date": "2005-05-18", "original_language": "hu", "original_title": "Johanna", "genre_ids": [18], "backdrop_path": "/9Q29QEDUxks77hTLF7ghdm2ccMr.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Johanna, a young drug addict, falls into a deep coma after an accident.
