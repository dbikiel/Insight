Produced with the world's leading orchestras and musicians, told through a 25,000 mile journey along every route Mozart followed, this detective story takes us to the heart of genius. Throughout, it is the music that takes center stage, with the jigsaw of Mozart's life fitting around it. With rigorous analysis from musicologists and experts such as Jonathan Miller, Cliff Eisen, Nicholas Till, Bayan Northcott and the late Stanley Sadie, a new, vivid impression of the composer emerges. It dispels the many common myths about Mozart's genius, health, relationships, death and character, to present a new image, very different from Milos Forman's 'Amadeus'.", "popularity": 1.657, "poster_path": "/l7Cw622d1agHCHcgRCOYiR7hdw.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2006-01-04", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 129, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "In Search of Mozart", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 4, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/cBAVsUbi5ktfbbZGT6BeSYwrqH6.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 10749], "id": 41839, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The War Bride", "overview": "Anna Friel stars in classy wartime drama The War Bride.
