In both films he plays a character who is Jewish, as Dalio was in real life. In fact, in most of the French films he's in the 1930s, he almost always plays shady characters, informers, blackmailers and gangsters. In other words, he is always \"the Jew.\" When the Nazis invaded France in 1940, he fled to America and appeared in CASABLANCA and TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT. In America, he was no longer the Jew but The Frenchman. He became, in dozens of films, America's idea of a typical Frenchman. His film career has these two strands in which he has two different identities. Are you defined by other people and their perceptions of who you are? Are you always a creation of the way people want to see you? Or can you exist outside of the arbitrary boundaries which are placed on you?", "poster_path": "/bnk04Njr8wu3YPdJLA6jDP9Ecxe.jpg", "release_date": "2015-04-30", "title": "I, Dalio", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 1.741}, {"id": 444043, "video": false, "vote_count": 5, "vote_average": 7.4, "title": "Histoire(s) du cin\u00e9ma", "release_date": "1989-03-12", "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "Histoire(s) du cin\u00e9ma", "genre_ids": [99], "backdrop_path": null, "adult": false, "overview": "Daunting, provocative, and very beautiful, this meditative essay looks at the history of the 20th century through cinema and vice versa, mainly through a rich assortment of clips (sometimes superimposing more than one), sound tracks (sometimes paired with visuals from other films), poetic commentary (with plenty of metaphors), and captions.", "poster_path": "/nP1SayeuzEqOufNxSIoroY9V5qo.jpg", "popularity": 1.318}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/tp4b2eFQ2KW1zAnKahLlBXTd7Oc.jpg", "genre_ids": [80], "id": 42838, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Whispering Footsteps", "overview": "An Ohio bank clerk's life becomes a nightmare when his descriptions is a fit of a maniac killer.", "poster_path": "/zCMaDRgbiUtBgmRN3SPNrCoSxd5.jpg", "release_date": "1943-12-30", "title": "Whispering Footsteps", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.6, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 5.061}, {"id": 65991, "video": false, "vote_count": 7, "vote_average": 6.0, "title": "Hunt the Man Down", "release_date": "1950-12-26", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Hunt the Man Down", "genre_ids": [80, 9648], "backdrop_path": "/vdFm47Y0En8NgYXHbI0NCg63Ua9.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A lawyer uncovers secrets behind a 12-year-old murder case.", "poster_path": "/jdFhPDswhOovFyxYBNEaaZwHqCh.jpg", "popularity": 2.792}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99], "id": 127293, "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "Lumumba : La Mort du proph\u00e8te", "overview": "Documentary about African political leader Patrice Lumumba, who was Prime Minister of Zaire (now Congo) when he was assassinated in 1961.", "poster_path": "/aLeWhBcgRMbOgG08SWfldVec3yS.jpg", "release_date": "1992-09-30", "title": "Lumumba: Death of a Prophet", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.3, "vote_count": 6, "popularity": 1.471}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/ekSI8N8VxGMHBu8nvqc4dAvmFkG.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 185078, "original_language": "it", "original_title": "Senza piet\u00e0", "overview": "An Italian sex worker falls in love with a black American soldier during World War II.", "poster_path": "/fETvnZMnVAGRqUYINZuWvrItZl.jpg", "release_date": "1948-08-04", "title": "Without Pity", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 2.198}, {"id": 173873, "video": false, "vote_count": 5, "vote_average": 5.8, "title": "Courage for Every Day", "release_date": "1964-01-01", "original_language": "cs", "original_title": "Ka\u017ed\u00fd den odvahu", "genre_ids": [18], "backdrop_path": "/zajakx3X4HlN7yvTMumPJHLwqQg.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A passionate communist worker is discouraged by the changing political climate and the failure of his peers to live up to his ideals.", "poster_path": "/qR1Wrk7CqXb9FYtOGUL96EwCqx2.jpg", "popularity": 1.649}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [36, 16, 99], "id": 208561, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Great", "overview": "An animated film about the British engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who spearheaded numerous engineering marvels of the early 19th century - including the Thames Tunnel, the Great Western Railway, and the Great Eastern steamship (for 40 years the world's largest steamship).
