When the serial murders seem to coincide with Isabel's touring schedule, ace reporter \"Scoop\" McClure gets on the mad scientist's trail.", "poster_path": "/vkIehOHwHwGC7kJmMquyu3zpTf5.jpg", "release_date": "1943-11-12", "title": "The Mad Ghoul", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 13, "popularity": 2.412}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/6MopPjK7zwWh5Q5Y1ulxVXDYROu.jpg", "genre_ids": [27], "id": 35911, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Cult of the Cobra", "overview": "While stationed in Asia, six American G.I.'s witness the secret ritual of Lamians (worshipers of women who can change into serpents).
