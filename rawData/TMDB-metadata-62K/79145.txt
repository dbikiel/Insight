In Cleese's very own words: \"it is an evening of well honed anecdotes, psychoanalytical tit-bits and unprovoked attacks on former colleagues, especially Michael Palin.\" Cleese has achieved a lot in his career which started as a sketch writer for BBC Radio's Dick Emery Show and then The Frost Report. After this stardom beckoned, and Monty Python was created with Cleese co-writing and starring in four series and three films. He went on to achieve further great success as the neurotic hotel manager Basil Fawlty in Fawlty Towers, which he co-wrote with then wife Connie Booth.", "popularity": 2.69, "poster_path": "/6dSLUJQx0Q1ZnMfCUIjsgEfcjmM.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "2011-08-11", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 79, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "John Cleese - The Alimony Tour Live", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.8, "vote_count": 2, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 161817, "name": "monty python"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 4543, "video": false, "vote_count": 1027, "vote_average": 7.4, "title": "The Meaning of Life", "release_date": "1983-03-31", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Meaning of Life", "genre_ids": [35], "backdrop_path": "/uBnZ4JxkHcDXL9CY7ekNoXZl9Y5.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Life's questions are 'answered' in a series of outrageous vignettes, beginning with a staid London insurance company which transforms before our eyes into a pirate ship.
