Contrary to the romanticized film version, the structures represent a period of terror, desperation, and death for over 16,000 POWs and 100,00 local slaves.  The Thailand - Burma Railway was the vision of the Japanese Imperial Army: a 250-mile track cut through dense jungle that would connect Bangkok and Rangoon. To accomplish this nearly impossible feat, the fanatical and ruthless Japanese engineers used POWs and local slaves as manpower.  Candid interviews with men who lived through the atrocity - including Dutch, Australian, British, and American POWs - illuminate the violence and horror of their three-and-a-half-year internment. From Britain's surrender of Singapore the enduring force of friendship, The True Story Of The Bridge On The River Kwai narrates a moving and unforgettable account of a period in history that must be remembered.", "popularity": 1.635, "poster_path": "/mr94NcSgwPVCcYVA1hSWm0wHzNf.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 24027, "logo_path": null, "name": "Greystone Communications", "origin_country": "US"}, {"id": 3507, "logo_path": null, "name": "History Channel", "origin_country": "US"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2000-09-26", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 93, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "ja", "name": "\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "The true story of what happened in World War 2 Thailand", "title": "The True Story of the Bridge on the River Kwai", "video": false, "vote_average": 8.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 1956, "name": "world war ii"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 424, "video": false, "vote_count": 8988, "vote_average": 8.6, "title": "Schindler's List", "release_date": "1993-11-30", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Schindler's List", "genre_ids": [18, 36, 10752], "backdrop_path": "/cTNYRUTXkBgPH3wP3kmPUB5U6dA.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "The true story of how businessman Oskar Schindler saved over a thousand Jewish lives from the Nazis while they worked as slaves in his factory during World War II.", "poster_path": "/yPisjyLweCl1tbgwgtzBCNCBle.jpg", "popularity": 25.457}, {"id": 293982, "video": false, "vote_count": 119, "vote_average": 6.9, "title": "Warsaw 44", "release_date": "2014-07-30", "original_language": "pl", "original_title": "Miasto 44", "genre_ids": [18, 36, 10749, 10752], "backdrop_path": "/wv4kNz9aJPO200vndn5Paczh12K.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "City of Warsaw, Poland, August 1, 1944.
