After the war, the poets live and work together with Coleridge's wife, Sara (Samantha Morton), and Wordsworth's sister, Dorothy (Emily Woof). At first this communal arrangement works to the advantage of Coleridge--who does some of his best writing while Wordsworth stagnates--until Coleridge becomes addicted to opium. Wordsworth, meanwhile, doesn't find his voice until he abandons his friend. In 20th-century vernacular, Wordsworth is the yuppie, Coleridge the hippie.", "poster_path": "/dO7wct6RAdDKEaQrA9IYD4BsKJL.jpg", "release_date": "2001-06-29", "title": "Pandaemonium", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.3, "vote_count": 3, "popularity": 2.962}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/dtO0EWZO2MZIFnMzPyfDoA3iuTL.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 167028, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Crossed Over", "overview": "Based on the book Crossed Over: A Murder/A Memoir by Beverly Lowry, Crossed Over tells the true story of a woman, Beverly Lowry, who after the tragic hit-and-run death of her teenage son, sinks into a deep depression.
