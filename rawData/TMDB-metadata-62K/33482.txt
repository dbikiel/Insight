As a publicity stunt, Slats plants an article about Molly claiming her ambition is to earn enough money to attend staid, all-girl Bixby College. Bixby's progressive dean offers Molly a scholarship. Molly accepts on the condition that Slats and Oliver come along too as campus caretakers. But the pompous Chairman threatens to foreclose on the school's mortgage if Molly isn't expelled. Together, the trio, with the help of some new friends, concocts a scheme to raise enough money to save the school. The plan involves a bet on the Bixby basketball team, which is playing in a game rated at 20 to 1 by the local bookie. But the bookie has other plans for their dough and hires a group of ringers to step in for the opponents. All is not lost, at least while Oliver has the chance to turn things around for his friends-one way or another.", "popularity": 3.754, "poster_path": "/6V3Qhpbv8CJZHc2YXf5ATPMaVrY.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 33, "logo_path": "/8lvHyhjr8oUKOOy2dKXoALWKdp0.png", "name": "Universal Pictures", "origin_country": "US"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1945-02-02", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Here Come the Co-eds", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.4, "vote_count": 12, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 4344, "name": "musical"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 224141, "video": false, "vote_count": 3144, "vote_average": 5.7, "title": "Into the Woods", "release_date": "2014-12-24", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Into the Woods", "genre_ids": [35, 14], "backdrop_path": "/lzJzB0QfkjpGCm9qUC4XpEIB6pm.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "In a woods filled with magic and fairy tale characters, a baker and his wife set out to end the curse put on them by their neighbor, a spiteful witch.", "poster_path": "/5h91odPFNlBuJbRBj5N4MEBfXDE.jpg", "popularity": 29.368}, {"id": 872, "video": false, "vote_count": 1617, "vote_average": 8.2, "title": "Singin' in the Rain", "release_date": "1952-04-10", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Singin' in the Rain", "genre_ids": [35, 10402, 10749], "backdrop_path": "/amW1YWQvcP8slDyDp1R652aVQZ7.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "In 1927 Hollywood, a silent film production company and cast make a difficult transition to sound.", "poster_path": "/s39odBPtyutGBnEfBIpdm0fpRwv.jpg", "popularity": 17.295}, {"id": 18126, "video": false, "vote_count": 1217, "vote_average": 6.4, "title": "Hannah Montana: The Movie", "release_date": "2009-04-10", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Hannah Montana: The Movie", "genre_ids": [35, 18, 10402, 10749, 10751], "backdrop_path": "/ezx3NkXNqf2KnJCP6Nfj1bfCFut.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "As Hannah Montana's popularity begins to take over her life, Miley Stewart, on the urging from her father takes a trip to her hometown of Crowley Corners, Tennessee to get some perspective on what matters in life the most.", "poster_path": "/8pwbnmvshHj2yYPYlyJ8K8Yzecy.jpg", "popularity": 12.479}, {"id": 2005, "video": false, "vote_count": 1806, "vote_average": 6.7, "title": "Sister Act", "release_date": "1992-05-28", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Sister Act", "genre_ids": [35, 10402], "backdrop_path": "/oaLqlJxt8TJSjsdfMpSkLexZ4l5.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A Reno singer witnesses a mob murder and the cops stash her in a nunnery to protect her from the mob's hitmen.
