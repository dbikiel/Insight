Throughout it all she is constantly in peril from one thing or another, crocodiles, hippos, car accidents, drowning, you name it. Even at the very end the crazed big game hunter is in a scuba suit sneaking up under the boat and drilling a hole in its hull.", "popularity": 1.4, "poster_path": "/rdpy2zwAmAnZvO79biVNWY8Ysuq.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1967-08-02", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 107, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Perils of Pauline", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "George Stedman", "credit_id": "52fe4d16c3a36847f824dfbd", "gender": 2, "id": 24810, "name": "Pat Boone", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/cJrvLDdFnQHjHxO0DxDVDQ1Oa5K.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "Pauline", "credit_id": "52fe4d16c3a36847f824dfc1", "gender": 1, "id": 163313, "name": "Pamela Austin", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/6ui0H7ZJ9rp5JchxBRXabSweBVH.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "Sten Martin", "credit_id": "52fe4d16c3a36847f824dfc5", "gender": 2, "id": 29427, "name": "Terry-Thomas", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/tdsN3NUsBNEPtHkWX5BskfG7yCi.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Caspar Coleman", "credit_id": "52fe4d16c3a36847f824dfc9", "gender": 2, "id": 2437, "name": "Edward Everett Horton", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/yf4MoiK7wnb2dafruUvnVgtuxSN.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Thorpe", "credit_id": "52fe4d16c3a36847f824dfcd", "gender": 2, "id": 101606, "name": "Hamilton Camp", "order": 4, "profile_path": "/tB43NEMeqmQM4zQQc5zk0IIcqg3.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 8, "character": "Pygmy Leader", "credit_id": "5d3fdfb99cc67b0013764b64", "gender": 2, "id": 12659, "name": "Billy Barty", "order": 5, "profile_path": "/h6Xf5csmdoIOUIFi8iRjtQMygQT.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4d16c3a36847f824dfd3", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 153772, "job": "Director", "name": "Herbert B.
