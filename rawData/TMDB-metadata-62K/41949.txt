An otter trapped in a burrow is rescued by 10-year-old Anders and his six-year-old brother, Kjell. In secret, the boys cage the animal and finally domesticate it. They obtain food for the Otter by fishing through the ice on a frozen lake. The boys manage to keep their secret from their family. On the eve of the May Day festival, Kjell reveals to family and friends the otter's presence. Anders is so distressed that he runs into the woods with the otter. The otter breaks away and returns to its life of natural freedom. The film was a prize winner at the 1954 Cannes Film Festival.", "poster_path": "/i7aFfpAsB7lsyG9MjGmP6pwbmA1.jpg", "release_date": "1953-09-28", "title": "The Great Adventure", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.5, "vote_count": 6, "popularity": 1.4}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/w4zgsAgfRoWQgjkO1nrraabmPu0.jpg", "genre_ids": [35], "id": 85420, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Movie Movie", "overview": "Three movie genres of the 1930s, boxing films, WWI aviation dramas, and backstage Broadway musicals, are satirized using the same cast.", "poster_path": "/ibbixbVqqAcs2fot7dUcyOALFsD.jpg", "release_date": "1978-11-01", "title": "Movie Movie", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.3, "vote_count": 6, "popularity": 2.524}, {"id": 67022, "video": false, "vote_count": 7, "vote_average": 5.6, "title": "Quartet", "release_date": "1981-10-25", "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "Quartet", "genre_ids": [18, 10749], "backdrop_path": "/gC5iO36KfH46iVdsCWmEH7X91Oh.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Quartet is the story of a girl who, adrift with her feckless husband amidst the literati of glittering Paris in the 1920s, becomes entrapped by a rich and sybaritic English couple.
