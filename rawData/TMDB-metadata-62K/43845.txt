Caroline (Anne Vernon) is his flibbertigibbet spouse. The two quarrel over an evening dress, they separate and then reunite. These farcical proceedings are counterpointed by Becker's naturalistic choice of settings, including Eduoard and Caroline's less-than-fashionable apartment and the prison-like confines of Caroline's uncle's mansion.", "poster_path": "/5NlZoqbXJTGQmBcFvhw4H07MZKh.jpg", "release_date": "1951-04-06", "title": "Edward and Caroline", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 7, "popularity": 2.712}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 10}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 2, "character": "Louis XVI King of France", "credit_id": "52fe4664c3a36847f80fc711", "gender": 2, "id": 25159, "name": "Pierre Renoir", "order": 0, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "Queen Marie-Antoinette", "credit_id": "52fe4664c3a36847f80fc715", "gender": 1, "id": 34824, "name": "Lise Delamare", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/cUehjq4u8ICjd1P9yJkfJ8SIZ0R.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Roederer", "credit_id": "52fe4664c3a36847f80fc719", "gender": 2, "id": 109345, "name": "Louis Jouvet", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/mPpkSTj83iUkxe0lqo58KK7ekFL.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "5ac6864592514162a4014c13", "department": "Writing", "gender": 2, "id": 11528, "job": "Writer", "name": "Jean Renoir", "profile_path": "/oN93wdY94BIVDQVbFfHGOBCk3L.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "5ac7738e0e0a264967029117", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 11528, "job": "Director", "name": "Jean Renoir", "profile_path": "/oN93wdY94BIVDQVbFfHGOBCk3L.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "5b6d7520925141034104ec91", "department": "Camera", "gender": 0, "id": 54364, "job": "Director of Photography", "name": "Alain Douarinou", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5b6d75290e0a267eeb15872c", "department": "Camera", "gender": 0, "id": 32293, "job": "Director of Photography", "name": "Jean Bourgoin", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5b6d75410e0a267ee7152ad8", "department": "Camera", "gender": 0, "id": 1580993, "job": "Director of Photography", "name": "Jean-Marie Maillols", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5b6d756c9251414068143a22", "department": "Camera", "gender": 0, "id": 960721, "job": "Director of Photography", "name": "Jean-Paul Alphen", "profile_path": null}]}}
