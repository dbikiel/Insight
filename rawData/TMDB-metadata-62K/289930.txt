But as the challenges and turmoil of each generation may differ as time changes, what was learned in the past cannot help but effect the choices that are made in the future as it is passed down from generation to generation. And that is the universal message that being true to yourself is precious. It is the source of strength that empowers one to become the person they want to be, to march forward as far as their hearts desire, into the future.", "popularity": 4.226, "poster_path": "/szMFnofjf6RZN596GVlDVmf1CSP.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 14714, "logo_path": "/oQHaOZEnPzlJACVTisV0FICrS82.png", "name": "China Film Group Corporation", "origin_country": "CN"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CN", "name": "China"}], "release_date": "2018-01-12", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 138, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "zh", "name": "\u666e\u901a\u8bdd"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Forever Young", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.1, "vote_count": 8, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 478, "name": "china"}, {"id": 10683, "name": "coming of age"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 84892, "video": false, "vote_count": 6553, "vote_average": 7.7, "title": "The Perks of Being a Wallflower", "release_date": "2012-09-20", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Perks of Being a Wallflower", "genre_ids": [18], "backdrop_path": "/uhLcaTPeBpUNgYhZXhDWkj7gMkp.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "15-year-old freshman Charlie is a wallflower, always watching life from the sidelines, until two charismatic senior students become his mentors.
