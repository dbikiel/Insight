If they pen a worthy horror script, Sarge will fund the entire project. But there is one condition - the script must be complete in two weeks. With the deadline looming and no fresh ideas, Todd and Bruce head to Shangri-La, a serene artist's retreat, with the hope that the peace and company of fellow artists will inspire greatness... or, failing greatness, at least enough for straight-to-DVD. Shangri-La proves to be anything but serene, as the artists die off one by one, seemingly by accident. Bruce convinces Todd to soak in this morbid atmosphere to help with the writing, but soon those two are fighting for their lives as well.", "popularity": 2.582, "poster_path": "/nC2QBCqCFvW3x8fDVikEYKWgCLi.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 93837, "logo_path": null, "name": "Lakeview Pictures", "origin_country": "US"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2014-05-03", "revenue": 0, "runtime": null, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Cabining", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.8, "vote_count": 6, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/qkvT9UBwaCnMaskWbzVXBDBO82P.jpg", "genre_ids": [53], "id": 109230, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Eves", "overview": "A group of students are en route to the beach for spring break when their car overheats near a crumbling hunting lodge, leaving them alone and defenseless while an unseen force attacks them from all sides.", "poster_path": "/uz2rQj9kWlVXI22rbjJbZFXe3bv.jpg", "release_date": "2011-04-30", "title": "The Eves", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.4, "vote_count": 9, "popularity": 3.305}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/7IMOYhlxFVJfoFsHrAAI1620J4R.jpg", "genre_ids": [27], "id": 38498, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Hard Ride to Hell", "overview": "A group of family and friends on a camping trip through the Texas badlands are taken on a on-way ride to Hell after they inadvertently witness a ritual sacrifice at a deserted campsite.
