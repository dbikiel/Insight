Unsuccessful in turning the movie into a yodeling extravaganza, they decide to fire the actress. This results in having her irate beau pull the plug on the film's financing. The beginning of the end is marked by cast members dropping like flies due to any number of reasons. Bad macaroni salad. Bad chili. Bad caterer. A camera dolly runs over a crew member, severing some key limb or another. Then since no cast member has survived, and the film's producers can't hire replacements, the 'Guns on Clackamas' makers must resort to solutions at once startling and hilarious.", "popularity": 0.6, "poster_path": "/dZIu4Me2KGXErKfkhO3ZWOozxUR.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1995-01-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": null, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Guns on the Clackamas", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 9454, "name": "frontier"}, {"id": 11800, "name": "mockumentary"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 50357, "video": false, "vote_count": 539, "vote_average": 5.0, "title": "Apollo 18", "release_date": "2011-07-20", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Apollo 18", "genre_ids": [27, 878, 53], "backdrop_path": "/aHE8y4A4mlRCQbJ5oLbPkr5iznx.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Officially, Apollo 17 was the last manned mission to the moon.
