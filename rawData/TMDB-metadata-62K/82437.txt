The city was awash with the trappings of America\u2019s cultural revolution-the San Francisco State University campus flooded with cops in riot gear, the Haight filled with drifters and idealists, and, on the third floor of Arlyck\u2019s building, a come-one-come-all crashpad apartment. It was from this top floor commune that the precocious 4-year-old Sean would occasionally wander downstairs to visit and talk-and one day Arlyck turned on his camera.  Sean\u2019s casual commentary on everything from smoking pot to living with speed freaks was delivered in simple sincerity throughout the soon-to-be famous 15-minute film. This First Child of the notorious decade may have shaken the audience with his simple sentence- \u201cSure, I smoke pot\u201d-but it was his barefoot impishness which would encapsulate the hope that lay in front of the nation: a promise of infinite possibility.", "popularity": 1.005, "poster_path": "/h0bOiz7VcmmcLoiOJVXLYuvt4bb.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 116489, "logo_path": null, "name": "Timed Exposures", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2006-05-05", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 87, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "The more things change, the more we're not the same", "title": "Following Sean", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.4, "vote_count": 7, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/nr5befSvGAX2504s3X4JXy4gzwQ.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 62325, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Bhutto", "overview": "BHUTTO is the definitive documentary that chronicles the life of one of the most complex and fascinating characters of our time.

The later discovery of a long-missing reel complicated earlier readings, showing the manipulations of camera crews in these \"everyday\" scenes.
