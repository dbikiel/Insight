Nevertheless, she was a staple in the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show and similar wild west companies. Because of her diminutive stature, she was billed as \"Little Sure Shot.\" The man assisting her is this appearance is probably her husband, Frank E. Butler. Annie had outshot Butler (a famous dead-eye marksman himself) in a shooting contest in the 1880's. Instead of nursing his bruised ego because he had been throughly outgunned by a woman, Butler fell in love, married Little Sure Shot, and became her manager.", "poster_path": "/onLyR1ktBBLWQjBBNcO78HalgJc.jpg", "release_date": "1894-11-01", "title": "Annie Oakley", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 20, "popularity": 1.126}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99], "id": 189054, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Luis Martinetti, Contortionist", "overview": "Luis Martinetti, a contortionist suspended from acrobatic flying rings, contorts himself for about thirty seconds.
