In the summer of 1944, 168 airmen from the US, England, Canada and other Allied countries were captured in Paris by the German Gestapo and sent to the infamous \"Koncentration Lager Buchenwald\" in Germany. Falsely accused of being \"terrorists and saboteurs,\" the airmen faced a terrifying fight for survival and a race against time to escape their execution. A controversial moment in history that their home countries tried to hush-up, Lost Airmen of Buchenwald tells this harrowing story through interviews with seven surviving members of the group, including their heroic commanding officer. The film follows them from their days hiding with the French Resistance to the darkest corners of the Holocaust, where they struggled to survive as Germany collapsed under the weight of the advancing Russian and Allied armies", "popularity": 0.6, "poster_path": "/18vaVmg1TVmkDgdXKIYM9kbsPHf.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 68001, "logo_path": null, "name": "Marauder Works", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2011-01-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": null, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "Allied airmen imprisoned at the Buchenwald Concentration Camp", "title": "Lost Airmen of Buchenwald", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 7, "character": "Narrator", "credit_id": "568097029251414ecb00041c", "gender": 0, "id": 1554671, "name": "Jared Gustafson", "order": 1, "profile_path": null}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "56809604c3a36860e900e5aa", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 1554661, "job": "Writer", "name": "Michael Dorsey", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5680961c9251412e5200cd3e", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 1554663, "job": "Writer", "name": "Gerald Baron", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5680963ac3a3682abc007abb", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1554665, "job": "Director", "name": "Michael Dorsey", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "568096979251414ecb0003fe", "department": "Editing", "gender": 0, "id": 1554668, "job": "Editor", "name": "Michael Dorsey", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "568096a8c3a3684be900e4cf", "department": "Sound", "gender": 0, "id": 1554669, "job": "Sound Editor", "name": "Michael Dorsey", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5968f8289251413418021b86", "department": "Camera", "gender": 0, "id": 935566, "job": "Director of Photography", "name": "Chris Baron", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5968f830c3a36879cb020095", "department": "Camera", "gender": 0, "id": 1554667, "job": "Director of Photography", "name": "Roderick E.
