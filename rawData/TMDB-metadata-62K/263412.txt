The witches are female and from the lower classes, the persecutors are wealthy white Christians. The story revolves around Garazi (Silvia Munt) whose grandmother is burned at the stake when convicted by the Spanish inquisitor of being a witch, something that brings Garazi under suspicion and eventually into prison. She is tortured in prison and raped by her rejected suitor, the vicious son of a local landlord. While Garazi is suffering her own pain, a struggle on a much broader scale is in the offing.", "popularity": 2.073, "poster_path": "/5x9erwDGDyflI3zQM6GrKU4ByX.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 64913, "logo_path": null, "name": "Amboto Producciones Cinematogr\u00e1ficas", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "ES", "name": "Spain"}], "release_date": "1984-03-08", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 109, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "es", "name": "Espa\u00f1ol"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Akelarre", "video": false, "vote_average": 3.7, "vote_count": 3, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 13006, "name": "torture"}, {"id": 177894, "name": "witch hunt"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/rPfyX0pkmn8Ea4gh3DfsmzFUf05.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 27, 80], "id": 74997, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence)", "overview": "Inspired by the fictional Dr. Heiter, disturbed loner Martin dreams of creating a 12-person centipede and sets out to realize his sick fantasy.", "poster_path": "/kFtAdkCO0vXN2RWu2oMcR9GZ9Hi.jpg", "release_date": "2011-10-06", "title": "The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence)", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.5, "vote_count": 674, "popularity": 14.216}, {"id": 15356, "video": false, "vote_count": 392, "vote_average": 6.5, "title": "The Girl Next Door", "release_date": "2007-07-19", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Girl Next Door", "genre_ids": [80, 18, 27, 53], "backdrop_path": "/u4ojeMIOYBTWyI32L9vIikKQUXX.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "In a quiet suburban town in the summer of 1958, two recently orphaned sisters are placed in the care of their mentally unstable Aunt Ruth.
