The film tells the story of an encounter with the Devil and various attendant phantoms. It is intended to evoke amusement and wonder from its audiences, rather than fear. However, because of its themes and characters, it has been considered to technically be the first horror film, as well as potentially the first vampire film.  The film opens with a large bat flying into a medieval castle, circling a room, and then suddenly changing into the Devil. Producing a cauldron, Mephistopheles conjures up a young girl and various supernatural creatures in an effort to scare two cavaliers, eventually succeeding in causing one to flee. Ultimately the remaining cavalier is confronted face-to-face by the Devil before reaching for and brandishing a large crucifix, which causes the Devil to vanish.", "popularity": 4.882, "poster_path": "/o61cxCGlLdPxzv7BPYitmbDfaeA.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 45867, "logo_path": null, "name": "Star Film Company", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "1896-12-24", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 3, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "xx", "name": "No Language"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Haunted Castle", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 70, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 6152, "name": "supernatural"}, {"id": 154802, "name": "silent film"}, {"id": 232797, "name": "early cinema"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/twGxeStlGooWV3gP6ZIcSNuQ6jf.jpg", "genre_ids": [12, 16, 10751, 14], "id": 81684, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Gruffalo's Child", "overview": "A follow up to the 2009 animated feature and adapted from the childrens' book by Julia Donaldson and Alex Scheffler.
