Gabrielle, his older sister, tells us of her brother's birth in Burma, childhood in Warwickshire, life at Cambridge and in London, then back to his parents' home in Tanworth. His parents describe his habits and personality. Two friends and the producer, arranger, sound engineer, and photographer for his three albums comment. His mother, a musician and poet, is an early influence. His quiet folk style made his one tour a disaster. His lack of success and gradual withdrawal end with his death at 26. Eleven of his recordings play on the soundtrack, usually as we see his room, a city, or the Warwickshire countryside.", "popularity": 1.86, "poster_path": "/n433IPeL37V4ofe5i1DJ5sAZ0O2.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "NL", "name": "Netherlands"}], "release_date": "2002-04-19", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 48, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "A Skin Too Few: The Days of Nick Drake", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.7, "vote_count": 12, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/6NdptzWczGVAIZPIi02qriRjVxW.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 76102, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "N Is a Number: A Portrait of Paul Erd\u00f6s", "overview": "In an age when genius is a mere commodity, it is useful to look at a person who led a rich life without the traditional trappings of success.
