Peter Weiss intended to create associative images that can not be deciphered completely. Beyond any logical interpretation, he wanted to show pure inner feelings. In a conversation with Harun Farocki from 1980, Peter Weiss admitted in retrospect that the images had very well developed a strong psychological effect.

Gogol's story deals with Toma, a reluctant theology student who is forced to read the Psalms over an (un)dead girl for three nights in a row. All the while supernatural forces are trying to grab him from the Holy Circle drawn on the church floor. Kadijevic adapts and enriches 'Viy' by inventing a new backstory for the witch-girl and her father. The dead girl, Catherine (unwittingly killed in the prologue, while in the shape of a hag), is referred to as a 'saint' and her father is a harsh and unpleasant man. Kadijevic departs further from the original story, and introduces an excess of perversity and horror more reminiscent of the Anglo-American gothic than the milder Slavic attempts in a similar mode.", "poster_path": "/y7dXtxdMLlBKvv6YRhi02JU8Jg4.jpg", "release_date": "1990-09-29", "title": "A Holy Place", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 8, "popularity": 1.4}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [16], "id": 117982, "original_language": "hr", "original_title": "Don Kihot", "overview": "\"Don Kihot\" is a satirical, Klee-esque meditation about Don Quijote in the contemporary militaristic and regimentistic world.", "poster_path": "/umMJknS900s0NAGq178hzUt2Ngf.jpg", "release_date": "1961-01-01", "title": "Don Quixote", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.2, "vote_count": 9, "popularity": 1.369}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/agSKjYAlrG25c6uCP3gUfCTBzRe.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 132851, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Black TV", "overview": "Black TV is the title of Tambellini\u2019s best-known videographic film, which is part of a large intermedia project about American television.
