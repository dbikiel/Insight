The dogs try and eat Emmo, but in order to save his life, the parrot promises them a new home with his owner, the wealthy Miss Lilly. The two dogs feel right at home at their new mansion, along with Miss Lilly's other pets (all strays): the beautiful Bella, the frisky Velvet, and the guard dog Sherman. Unfortuantely, it doesn't take long for Miss Lilly to \"kick the bucket\", and the dogs' future is in jeapordy, especially since Miss Lilly's scheaming niece &amp; nephew, Ronnie &amp; Hannie, have had their eyes on the estate for quite some time. When the will reveals that the pets are to inherit the estate (including the mansion and one million dollars!), the twins decide to take matters into their own hands to try and get what they think they deserve. It's up to JD, Chuffie, Emmo, Bella, Sherman, and Velvet to stop the twins.", "popularity": 1.754, "poster_path": "/kCVr9fgxUP915KjccagooP6uyYG.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 85146, "logo_path": "/2eG5vjJHl7woTbaqjVuWHcNHtGU.png", "name": "Ostdeutscher Rundfunk Brandenburg", "origin_country": "DE"}, {"id": 4606, "logo_path": "/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png", "name": "ZDF", "origin_country": "DE"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}], "release_date": "1999-04-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 84, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "Who wants to be a millionaire?", "title": "Millionaire Dogs", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.3, "vote_count": 3, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "Sherman (voice)", "credit_id": "58a71c929251413422000573", "gender": 0, "id": 1476706, "name": "Michael Chevalier", "order": 1, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "J.D.
