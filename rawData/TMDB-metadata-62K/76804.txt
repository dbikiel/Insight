She is recording the evidence of violence and massacre that is part of South Africa's recent history. Felix Teitelbaum, who features in Kentridge's first and fourth films as the humane and loving alter-ego to the ruthless capitalist white South African psyche, appears here semi-naked and alone in a foreign hotel room, brooding over Nandi's drawings of the damaged African landscape, which cover his suitcase and walls. Kentridge has commented: 'Felix in Exile was made at the time just before the first general election in South Africa, and questioned the way in which the people who had died on the journey to this new dispensation would be remembered'.", "poster_path": "/cOftNETL8xH04axyzu1TWVmNOwx.jpg", "release_date": "1994-06-15", "title": "Felix in Exile", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.3, "vote_count": 10, "popularity": 2.05}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99, 35], "id": 49176, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "O Dreamland", "overview": "Lindsay Anderson's early documentary film of a British amusement park, the irony of its manufactured fun on full display.", "poster_path": "/s76JNaWjxF5w2Rd3V3E8N6Jn6Je.jpg", "release_date": "1953-01-01", "title": "O Dreamland", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.3, "vote_count": 11, "popularity": 2.228}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 166709, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Pan 699", "overview": "A little boy celebrates his frog catch in this short film by Hollis Frampton.", "poster_path": "/k8Ud6e7ApQ4BHoiRZuMpWSf5fQ6.jpg", "release_date": "1974-01-01", "title": "Pan 699", "video": false, "vote_average": 3.8, "vote_count": 8, "popularity": 1.393}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 144943, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Machine of Eden", "overview": "Short film from Stan Brakhage", "poster_path": "/hpQ8vy0trlbfeVeqXHblnwmf07u.jpg", "release_date": "1970-09-23", "title": "The Machine of Eden", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.2, "vote_count": 10, "popularity": 2.906}], "total_pages": 2, "total_results": 40}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "Annabelle West", "credit_id": "52fe494ec3a368484e124c97", "gender": 1, "id": 43843, "name": "Laura La Plante", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/3gonRsNYBed3i4fDyXdEi2bRGZy.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "Paul Jones", "credit_id": "52fe494ec3a368484e124c9b", "gender": 2, "id": 97981, "name": "Creighton Hale", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/uqovtbUG2EYskIQjkLO95j6KdiK.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 6, "character": "Charles Wilder", "credit_id": "52fe494ec3a368484e124ca3", "gender": 2, "id": 148876, "name": "Forrest Stanley", "order": 2, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Roger Crosby", "credit_id": "52fe494ec3a368484e124c9f", "gender": 2, "id": 13359, "name": "Tully Marshall", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/zywfVcAvVfinpH4wI7f7wvgdDr9.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 8, "character": "Cecily", "credit_id": "54586dbac3a368399d001128", "gender": 1, "id": 141070, "name": "Gertrude Astor", "order": 4, "profile_path": "/jjIoqFS6mmfZFlhX8pcBhPVzIBJ.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 9, "character": "Susan", "credit_id": "54586dec0e0a26116f00117c", "gender": 1, "id": 998697, "name": "Flora Finch", "order": 5, "profile_path": "/s1JMktadQ0rWOhIUlPWxjtFphYf.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 10, "character": "Harry", "credit_id": "54586e000e0a26116a0010d0", "gender": 2, "id": 14486, "name": "Arthur Edmund Carewe", "order": 6, "profile_path": "/cplHs1q5RPXPFUkhcWjcz2Cd2cu.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 11, "character": "Mammy Pleasant", "credit_id": "54586e410e0a2611580011eb", "gender": 1, "id": 589729, "name": "Martha Mattox", "order": 7, "profile_path": "/8JaDf2VfQWL1ot5zR98wjP9AVUg.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 12, "character": "The Guard", "credit_id": "54586e610e0a261155001200", "gender": 2, "id": 8837, "name": "George Siegmann", "order": 8, "profile_path": "/uQme6Lt03wh2dzhWKcyov2tOMKg.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 13, "character": "Ira Lazar", "credit_id": "54586e750e0a2611620011c0", "gender": 2, "id": 34574, "name": "Lucien Littlefield", "order": 9, "profile_path": "/65jnSJmU2BC4Jrpg2Nfg6glU6wN.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe494ec3a368484e124ca9", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 48055, "job": "Director", "name": "Paul Leni", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "57e886f09251412ae3017332", "department": "Sound", "gender": 2, "id": 9079, "job": "Original Music Composer", "name": "Hugo Riesenfeld", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "57e886f7c3a368474300f605", "department": "Camera", "gender": 2, "id": 117734, "job": "Director of Photography", "name": "Gilbert Warrenton", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "57e886fd92514103410028f6", "department": "Editing", "gender": 0, "id": 131027, "job": "Editor", "name": "Martin G.
