Summits of My Life is the personal project of Kilian Jornet, in which for five years he has traveled to some of the most important peaks of the planet to try to establish FKT (fastest known time) of ascent and descent of some of the most emblematic mountains of the world.  The project is closely linked to values and a way of understanding the purist and minimalist mountain. The experiences lived in each challenge have been captured in different films.", "poster_path": "/z7ZbsCob3Tdb7NgnWX8xhq1pD5d.jpg", "release_date": "2018-03-01", "title": "Kilian Jornet, Path to Everest", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.4, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 3.343}, {"id": 475380, "video": false, "vote_count": 5, "vote_average": 5.9, "title": "Mi Mundial", "release_date": "2017-06-22", "original_language": "es", "original_title": "Mi Mundial", "genre_ids": [18, 10751], "backdrop_path": "/lEUNWSl8sR4mntMexLgJ45PHehZ.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "", "poster_path": "/kuHlEiRVQHLXR91gFpVEEgR9SOf.jpg", "popularity": 1.611}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/jaeFAKPbdCC1eXucHU5wX7FYh9J.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 494593, "original_language": "de", "original_title": "R\u00fcckenwind von vorn", "overview": "Young Berlin schoolteacher Charlie no longer wants to continue as usual on her chosen path and asks herself what she really wants and needs.", "poster_path": "/mRVJyqrukqpq0XdUW1VO1CdeLj0.jpg", "release_date": "2018-03-15", "title": "Away You Go", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.6, "vote_count": 10, "popularity": 3.2}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/8W3txaH2aJE0g0orDEnyChKuE5.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 498957, "original_language": "de", "original_title": "Eldorado", "overview": "Drawing inspiration from his personal encounter with the Italian refugee child Giovanna during World War II, Markus Imhoof tells how refugees and migrants are treated today: on the Mediterranean Sea, in Lebanon, in Italy, in Germany and in Switzerland.", "poster_path": "/f3SlYTKWtZVTPnixhILfp3iXMLc.jpg", "release_date": "2018-05-09", "title": "Eldorado", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.4, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 1.381}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/hVoPxSxQxui2VFsZ6ReKKrDjorR.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 18], "id": 543720, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Lost & Found", "overview": "'Lost and Found' is a film with 7 interconnecting stories set in and around a lost and found office of an Irish train station.", "poster_path": "/mZD6p5YNYCi5z6tWxBK4i4J0iYh.jpg", "release_date": "2018-07-13", "title": "Lost & Found", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.6, "vote_count": 11, "popularity": 1.578}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/qgbfK9MwuzQTvxhtpNKD3pgwVJl.jpg", "genre_ids": [27, 53], "id": 54942, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Night of the Cobra Woman", "overview": "Horror story of a beautiful girl turns into a man-eating cobra.", "poster_path": "/zFB1IRVdkSINYEmIGuAFrFK0kLI.jpg", "release_date": "1972-01-01", "title": "Night of the Cobra Woman", "video": false, "vote_average": 2.7, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 2.705}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/u56Hzp90j9AtPj4YTrEd5tGPPMQ.jpg", "genre_ids": [10749, 18], "id": 561605, "original_language": "sv", "original_title": "Eld & l\u00e5gor", "overview": "John and Ninni - both heirs to their own individual amusement parks - fall in love amidst the whirling world they both inhabit.
