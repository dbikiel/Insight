As historian John Lukacs explains, Churchill may not have won the War in 1940, but without him, the War most certainly would have been lost. Sir Martin Gilbert, historical consultant for the film and Churchill's official biographer, adds that had Churchill's warnings about Nazi Germany's racial policies towards Jews been heeded in the early 1930's, the Holocaust may never have occurred. The film examines why Winston Churchill's legacy continues to be relevant in the 21st Century and explores why his leadership remains inspirational to current day political leaders and diplomats.", "popularity": 1.463, "poster_path": "/jRx8XHNq1z8HFE3Q7TifK08tVl0.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2010-08-20", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 101, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "Seventy years ago, he kept hope alive.", "title": "Winston Churchill: Walking with Destiny", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 4, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "Narrator", "credit_id": "55ab9846c3a3682d63004d40", "gender": 2, "id": 2282, "name": "Ben Kingsley", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/n0cVP5K2VxlohkAf7LoRwPt4xhu.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "5407324f0e0a2618890015d9", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 1002149, "job": "Director", "name": "Richard Trank", "profile_path": null}]}}
