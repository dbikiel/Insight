However, the plan goes awry, and he finds himself deep in debt to two of his partners, gangster Sikander (Gulshan Grover) and hitman Kaif (Kay Kay Menon). In order to even the score and save his own skin, Arjun is forced to plan an even bigger con, with one of India's most powerful crime figures, Jehanghir Khan (Feroz Khan), as the target. Helping Arjun pull off the scam of a lifetime are his friends and cohorts Bhatia (Mukul Dev), a master forger; Jack (Amin Hajee), an all-purpose swindler; and Natasha (Koena Mitra), a beautiful psychiatrist whose passion for the nooks and crannies of the human mind had caused her to fall for Arjun.", "poster_path": "/6MAHEaFKiV7Kl31QqtOl81epqa2.jpg", "release_date": "2005-01-01", "title": "Ek Khiladi Ek Haseena", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.3, "vote_count": 6, "popularity": 2.042}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/pA3QA19JzZQV3q5DOZHOdwD1zIP.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 68876, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "32A", "overview": "This story is set in the \"in-between\" time of a girl's life, when she is no longer a child and not yet a woman.

They wear bras already (except Claire the feminist) and they've all had boyfriends. The new bra is a start but they really hope Maeve can find a fella, even offering kissing lessons to prepare her. What no one expects, least of all Maeve, is that she should snare the local sixteen-year old heartthrob.
