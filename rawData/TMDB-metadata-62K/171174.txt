Together with the short film Nutsa (1971) and the widely acclaimed Georgian Chronicle of the 19th Century (1979; SFIFF 1983), The Way Home closes a triptych of films that represent Rekhviashvili\u2019s poetic contemplation of Georgia\u2019s past. It makes extensive use of poems by Bella Akhmadulina (the major female poet of the cultural \u2018thaw\u2019 of the \u201950s and \u201960s and a Georgian by descent), and of sets by Amir Kakabadze.
