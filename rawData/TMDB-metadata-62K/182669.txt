He\u00b4s tired, a bit out of shape, and his conscience is drilling him. His career as a boxer ended abruptly when he killed his rival with one single punch. That\u00b4s why Marcos Wainsberg, the Inca of the Sinai, wants to quit fighting. But today is not the day to be thinking about that. Today his ex girlfriend will come, in peace. Today is a good day. But the doorbell rings and the person at the other side is his cousin, Huguito, the black sheep of the family. And Huguito always brings trouble. Family-sized trouble, of course. Today can be one of those days when everything changes. The only thing that is left to know is whether it will be for good or not\u2026 Diablo is an atypical film, to say the least. Regurgitated from the very insides of genre cinema, its furious and corrosive progression leaves you breathless, but also provokes a remarkable morbid pleasure with its accumulation of scenes featuring violence, black humor, and a pure, hardcore swagger.", "popularity": 0.6, "poster_path": "/5FpSBcsnxKJdu2I6199Xz3pWhgK.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "AR", "name": "Argentina"}], "release_date": "2011-11-05", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 85, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "es", "name": "Espa\u00f1ol"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Diablo", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.8, "vote_count": 3, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "", "credit_id": "52fe4c8a9251416c7511d9db", "gender": 2, "id": 1165749, "name": "Juan Palomino", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/9xu9GDegieb3oXCQFjc9GUIH8Wo.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "", "credit_id": "52fe4c8a9251416c7511d9df", "gender": 2, "id": 934904, "name": "Sergio Boris", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/kA3swDftUvCyCGRylCDpjxmtFis.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "", "credit_id": "52fe4c8a9251416c7511d9e3", "gender": 0, "id": 1262130, "name": "Luis Aranosky", "order": 2, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "", "credit_id": "52fe4c8a9251416c7511d9e7", "gender": 2, "id": 1028444, "name": "Luis Ziembrowski", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/zkrHNZJNn4lJX1zuRP74C6YvI5G.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "", "credit_id": "52fe4c8a9251416c7511d9eb", "gender": 2, "id": 1163564, "name": "Hugo Quiril", "order": 4, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 6, "character": "", "credit_id": "52fe4c8a9251416c7511d9ef", "gender": 2, "id": 1163565, "name": "Vic Cicuta", "order": 5, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 8, "character": "Noriega", "credit_id": "5bd690cdc3a36820f503a8b5", "gender": 2, "id": 1084678, "name": "Sebasti\u00e1n Mogordoy", "order": 6, "profile_path": "/yK0n6dBsY0qWyn5Rq3J0FU5Wch.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4c8a9251416c7511d9f5", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 1028438, "job": "Director", "name": "Nicanor Loreti", "profile_path": "/lXk6sOjNTghRzCyLFYhgxUrUxU0.jpg"}]}}
