The tent goes up. Schoolboys run to the tent. Village women come and watch an acrobat roll a hoop across a tightrope. A lion leaps from the edge of one stool - across darkness - on to another stool. A gap-toothed old woman gazes at a goat on a tight rope; her eyes are wide with curiosity.  For three days the circus makes small ripples in the life of this village. Municipal permits are required. At a toddy shop, a soldier befriends the circus strongman; a pump attendant sits on a rock each day watching a village girl bathe and dry her hair. The dwarf brings back to the circus a watermelon larger than his head. In the film's three days, we, the viewers, learn the geography of the village: the banyan treewith leaves like transparent film, the shining water, the light on the sand at sunset. When the circus leaves the village, it leaves us. The narrative says: The circus comes and leaves; life goes on.", "popularity": 0.62, "poster_path": "/2MV2K7LOkW4jOOgLuPaBmShrhPT.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 76002, "logo_path": null, "name": "General Pictures", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "IN", "name": "India"}], "release_date": "1978-01-18", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 129, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ml", "name": ""}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Circus Tent", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 291, "name": "circus"}, {"id": 5331, "name": "village"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 11360, "video": false, "vote_count": 3005, "vote_average": 6.9, "title": "Dumbo", "release_date": "1941-10-22", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Dumbo", "genre_ids": [16, 10751], "backdrop_path": "/sa5vHfu5n4NFqZbVf2hzqGr6bim.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Dumbo is a baby elephant born with over-sized ears and a supreme lack of confidence.
