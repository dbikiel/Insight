They loan him their last ten dollars so he can go start life anew, and for collateral, he gives them the deed to the Gulch. Unbeknownst to Wilson, the son of his longtime rival, Terry Turner (who's also in love with his daughter, Eva), has contacted the railroad to arrange for them to build through the land, making the old man rich and hopefully resolving the feud. But the evil Red Baxter, owner of a saloon, tricks the boys out of the deed, and it's up to them - as well as Quale, who naturally finds his way out west anyway - to save the day.", "popularity": 4.767, "poster_path": "/vcUY67n5qRlCeYjCi4Zwo22Hbv4.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 21, "logo_path": "/mjofSXiHpG5t6KYmU4l4FrUhT7m.png", "name": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "origin_country": "US"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1940-12-06", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 80, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "JUMP INTO YOUR BOOTS AND SADDLES...IT'S ROUND-UP TIME IN THE WILD AND WOOLY WEST!", "title": "Go West", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 39, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 4344, "name": "musical"}, {"id": 155291, "name": "cowboy"}, {"id": 190797, "name": "marx brothers"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 224141, "video": false, "vote_count": 3143, "vote_average": 5.7, "title": "Into the Woods", "release_date": "2014-12-24", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Into the Woods", "genre_ids": [35, 14], "backdrop_path": "/lzJzB0QfkjpGCm9qUC4XpEIB6pm.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "In a woods filled with magic and fairy tale characters, a baker and his wife set out to end the curse put on them by their neighbor, a spiteful witch.", "poster_path": "/5h91odPFNlBuJbRBj5N4MEBfXDE.jpg", "popularity": 28.397}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/90kmxuSwU28dVy1ghVSHI4x1wb8.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 18, 37], "id": 537996, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Ballad of Buster Scruggs", "overview": "Vignettes weaving together the stories of six individuals in the old West at the end of the Civil War.
