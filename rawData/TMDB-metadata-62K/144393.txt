Nevertheless, she was a staple in the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show and similar wild west companies. Because of her diminutive stature, she was billed as \"Little Sure Shot.\" The man assisting her is this appearance is probably her husband, Frank E. Butler. Annie had outshot Butler (a famous dead-eye marksman himself) in a shooting contest in the 1880's. Instead of nursing his bruised ego because he had been throughly outgunned by a woman, Butler fell in love, married Little Sure Shot, and became her manager.", "popularity": 1.126, "poster_path": "/onLyR1ktBBLWQjBBNcO78HalgJc.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 18758, "logo_path": "/fe3cMUJLhbkTM9PDxdDA8hQpAxp.png", "name": "Edison Manufacturing Company", "origin_country": "US"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1894-11-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 1, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "xx", "name": "No Language"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Annie Oakley", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 20, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 18105, "name": "sharpshooter"}, {"id": 155573, "name": "wild west"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 196, "video": false, "vote_count": 6115, "vote_average": 7.4, "title": "Back to the Future Part III", "release_date": "1990-05-25", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Back to the Future Part III", "genre_ids": [12, 35, 878], "backdrop_path": "/pP2a4MBQbIeZMbErBWMjxTT5Npb.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "The final installment of the Back to the Future trilogy finds Marty digging the trusty DeLorean out of a mineshaft and looking for Doc in the Wild West of 1885.
