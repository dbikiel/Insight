But two consecutive failures (real or imagined) lead her to believe that she has a real problem: she is useless in bed. Because she is more fragile than she appears, Emma hence decides to become... the best lay in Paris! She then sets out on a formidable plan of action (theory, practical, validation of acquired knowledge), which soon provokes a series of misunderstandings and disasters within her immediate vicinity. For one thing, her method doesn't turn out to be really adapted to her field of investigation. And Emma has probably also forgotten a little detail: love doesn't obey any plan. In this absurd and nutty quest, Emma will learn to let go, to lose control, and, to finally win her freedom.", "popularity": 4.028, "poster_path": "/ce0m5VOZ17jf03oKjJ9A15jbNRS.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 1546, "logo_path": null, "name": "Universal Pictures France", "origin_country": "FR"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "2014-01-15", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 91, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Best in Bed", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.1, "vote_count": 52, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/BsI3PzpQb03xZJkKPjB76hKgK8.jpg", "genre_ids": [35], "id": 253944, "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "Arr\u00eate ou je continue", "overview": "A couple goes on a hike in the woods, and the woman refuses to return.", "poster_path": "/am9vhMgJxfsnjoaGt9gBJFYnfb4.jpg", "release_date": "2014-03-05", "title": "If You Don't, I Will", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.8, "vote_count": 13, "popularity": 2.618}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/3UKPj8bs4V8rLE078YKHLSLNn0l.jpg", "genre_ids": [35], "id": 41179, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Pi\u00e8ce Mont\u00e9e", "overview": "The wedding of Vincent and Berenger does not begin well.
