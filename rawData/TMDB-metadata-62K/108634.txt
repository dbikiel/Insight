Rouqier concentrates on a single French farm family, following them through the four seasons. As in the works of Robert Flaherty, the human characters and the land surrounding them are \"one\", and Rouqier never misses an opportunity to parallel their lives with the eons-old phases of nature. The final symbolic images of Spring, achieved through time-lapse photography, are almost unbearably beautiful. The winner of several festival awards, Farrebique nonetheless did not immediately result in an outpouring of financing for Rouqier's follow-up films (this was a common problem in the financially strapped French film industry of the 1940s). Perhaps as a result, Rouqier did not make his sequel, Biquefarre (filmed in the same region, with some of the same \"actors\"), until 1983.", "poster_path": "/rx81Dh44AxQnTtDJqrlFPptvJk5.jpg", "release_date": "1946-09-01", "title": "Farrebique, or the Four Seasons", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 1.586}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/n8E93nYUgi1hOh6vTRBkhUmKlJZ.jpg", "genre_ids": [36, 99], "id": 98498, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Le Tombeau d'Alexandre", "overview": "A documentary on Soviet filmmaker Aleksandr Medvedkin, examining his tumultuous career, the rediscovery of his masterpiece Happiness, and Russia's struggles over the course of the 20th Century.", "poster_path": "/71V1hDhmyHe96587FPE4R4n1w0M.jpg", "release_date": "1993-03-25", "title": "The Last Bolshevik", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.6, "vote_count": 8, "popularity": 2.518}, {"id": 185579, "video": false, "vote_count": 11, "vote_average": 8.3, "title": "A Sixth Part of the World", "release_date": "1926-12-31", "original_language": "ru", "original_title": "\u0428\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u044f \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430", "genre_ids": [99], "backdrop_path": "/nLlI0t36cvtHz5KMeLraLYmZ6OO.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Through the travelogue format, it depicts the multitude of Soviet peoples in remote areas of USSR and details the entirety of the wealth of the Soviet land.
