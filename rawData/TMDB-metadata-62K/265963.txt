Solonitsyn was a favorite actor in Andrei Tarkovsky's films, and this was to be his penultimate role. This brief imaginary period in the famed Russian writer's life encapsulates one of his darker moments in 1866. At that time he was still a relatively unknown writer whose first widely acclaimed work, Crime and Punishment, was just on the horizon. His life was at a very low ebb as he struggled with debts he could not pay, and as he fought depression over the loss of his wife to tuberculosis, and the death of his brother, who was very close to him. His first literary journal had to be scrapped because of political reasons, and the second venture needed funding.", "poster_path": "/vApTks0PzougQ7xRXtMgb315DBL.jpg", "release_date": "1981-02-02", "title": "Twenty Six Days in the Life of Dostoevsky", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.8, "vote_count": 4, "popularity": 1.029}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/dQlKfGubTfQkk9MFsAASb8e5W2g.jpg", "genre_ids": [35], "id": 66078, "original_language": "ru", "original_title": "\u0414\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u0436\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0431\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0443", "overview": "A group of young motivated people are trying to convert old \"Oduvanchik\" restaurant in to a youth club.", "poster_path": "/pQzk0Ol5QY343NnaYlS4D1MEQYQ.jpg", "release_date": "1964-06-06", "title": "Give Me a Complaints Book", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.3, "vote_count": 6, "popularity": 1.357}, {"id": 37133, "video": false, "vote_count": 8, "vote_average": 6.8, "title": "Volga - Volga", "release_date": "1938-04-24", "original_language": "ru", "original_title": "\u0412\u043e\u043b\u0433\u0430-\u0412\u043e\u043b\u0433\u0430", "genre_ids": [35, 10402], "backdrop_path": "/9MDIY7yxRR8VjR8ZZgw33u3qygf.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Widely claimed to be Joseph Stalin's favorite movie, this classic musical comedy is a must-see.
