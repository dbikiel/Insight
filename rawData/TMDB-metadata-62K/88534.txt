While buying last-minute gifts at the supermarket, Radu thinks he spots ex-girlfriend Nadja, who he has never forgotten. In one small moment, Radu\u2019s insecurities about Adina come bubbling to the surface. No sooner have the corks begin to pop, the relationship comes to an abrupt end. This is followed by the perfectly timed offer from Radu\u2019s friend Alex to hit the town with him and his friends. Radu accepts the offer in the hope that Nadja is also out. Director Paul Negogescu draws a portrait of Radu with precision and subtle irony \u2013 and captures the atmosphere of a New Year\u2019s evening with great authenticity.", "poster_path": "/txTV4QLavST22Kki9L71LdQ50ZX.jpg", "release_date": "2012-11-16", "title": "A Month in Thailand", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 4, "popularity": 0.813}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/4EC0HdKkbolIFTUGwdDLBvumAYm.jpg", "genre_ids": [35], "id": 73705, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Professor", "overview": "Professor Bosco, a poor flea trainer, rents a bed in a flophouse.

To get the escapees back in their box again, the trainer resorts to... his whip! All is back to normal one more time. But not for long, as a stray dog enters the flophouse and very unwisely opens the box, thus creating new havoc.
