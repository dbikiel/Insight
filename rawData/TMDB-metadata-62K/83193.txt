Gogol's story deals with Toma, a reluctant theology student who is forced to read the Psalms over an (un)dead girl for three nights in a row. All the while supernatural forces are trying to grab him from the Holy Circle drawn on the church floor. Kadijevic adapts and enriches 'Viy' by inventing a new backstory for the witch-girl and her father. The dead girl, Catherine (unwittingly killed in the prologue, while in the shape of a hag), is referred to as a 'saint' and her father is a harsh and unpleasant man. Kadijevic departs further from the original story, and introduces an excess of perversity and horror more reminiscent of the Anglo-American gothic than the milder Slavic attempts in a similar mode.", "poster_path": "/y7dXtxdMLlBKvv6YRhi02JU8Jg4.jpg", "release_date": "1990-09-29", "title": "A Holy Place", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 8, "popularity": 1.7}, {"id": 82126, "video": false, "vote_count": 7, "vote_average": 4.5, "title": "Things", "release_date": "1989-09-01", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Things", "genre_ids": [27], "backdrop_path": "/nENgv5eEBtHi9uYKX9E6mT2kIaS.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "An impotent husband with a fanatical desire to father children, forces his wife to undergo a dangerous experiment.
