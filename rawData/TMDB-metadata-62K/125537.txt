Both are in relationships on rocky ground. As these emotions swirl, Tony meets his US Postal Service letter carrier, a single mom named Kathy who's come to LA from Wyoming with her daughter, a budding actress. Chris meets Anna, an Italian beauty working in the States for a few months wrangling animals on movie sets. Chris also befriends Clive, an aging and crusty man whose longing for his recently-deceased wife is a portrait of true love. Can Clive's example help Chris sort out his love life, and can Tony grow up enough to see the possibilities with Kathy and her daughter?", "popularity": 1.847, "poster_path": "/dCN855wZvVo5jH6oSdpdPQNKGI.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1999-09-16", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "two brothers, four women and the search for Magnetic Perfection", "title": "Smiling Fish & Goat On Fire", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 3, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 2, "character": "Chris Remi", "credit_id": "52fe4ac8c3a368484e166c13", "gender": 2, "id": 33349, "name": "Derick Martini", "order": 0, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "Alison", "credit_id": "52fe4ac8c3a368484e166c17", "gender": 1, "id": 181851, "name": "Amy Hathaway", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/vb4UTeWz30gUv380ecG7dzLQUES.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Tony Remi", "credit_id": "52fe4ac8c3a368484e166c1b", "gender": 0, "id": 204411, "name": "Steven Martini", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/abNHa9hAM8IJafgS1dE19GIbHQs.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Ginger Baker", "credit_id": "59cbf981c3a3687797017ead", "gender": 1, "id": 1895804, "name": "Wilda Taylor", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/vwmIvQ6cGWAPRNicZHlgH5ox8T4.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4ac8c3a368484e166c0f", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 85242, "job": "Director", "name": "Kevin Jordan", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5abd54c99251411e95030839", "department": "Production", "gender": 2, "id": 2010852, "job": "Unit Manager", "name": "Harry Kim", "profile_path": null}]}}
