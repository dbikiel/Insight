They rack their brains about where to find shelter and quite by chance they overhear a talk between father and son. The son is an adolescent who is head over heels in love with a girl several years his senior. He is living through the first drama of his life though his love is just puppy love. Then, being resourceful fellows, they think of a plan to pass one of them for the elder son of this family. The reason they give for his unexpected arrival is that he is a child of the father's long-forsaken love. They presume this cock-and-bull story will come off, and right they are!", "poster_path": "/yOagSK4AXOaUDaOXH6AngyIYPWk.jpg", "release_date": "1975-06-06", "title": "The Elder Son", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 11, "popularity": 1.862}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 1}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": []}}
