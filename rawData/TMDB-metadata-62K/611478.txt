Robbed of his position, power and wealth, his enemies have left him in isolation. But this is no ordinary man, and this no ordinary island. Prospero is a magician, able to control the very elements and bend nature to his will. When a sail appears on the horizon, he reaches out across the ocean to the ship that carries the men who wronged him. Creating a vast magical storm he wrecks the ship and washes his enemies up on the shore. When they wake they find themselves lost on a fantastical island where nothing is as it seems.", "popularity": 0.6, "poster_path": null, "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 159, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Royal Shakespeare Company: The Tempest", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "5d13e251925141076abcab46", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 125067, "job": "Director", "name": "Gregory Doran", "profile_path": null}]}}
