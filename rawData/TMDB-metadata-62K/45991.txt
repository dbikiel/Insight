The film is set during the tumultuous 1960s, an era when everyone's values were turned inside out, shaken around, and reassembled. The central character is first-generation American Craig Wasson, who confounds his Yugoslavian father (Miklos Simon) by pursuing his own let-it-all-hang-out lifestyle. Wasson's best friends are athlete Jim Metzler and chubby Michael Huddleston; all pursue the affections of bewitching Jodi Thelan. Though they are obviously deeply in love with one another, Wasson and Thelan continue to foolishly avoid a long-term commitment as the sixties unfold around them. Four Friends calls for a fresher approach than the one offered by director Arthur Penn, whose handling of the material is much too pat and old-fashioned.", "poster_path": "/xCuGYk8j0xPAskBCifLapyk1QlV.jpg", "release_date": "1981-12-11", "title": "Four Friends", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.4, "vote_count": 10, "popularity": 2.704}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/2rpLAyrwfwI7Jb5kgXLXB0bYO2j.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 10749], "id": 108634, "original_language": "ja", "original_title": "\u53f0\u98a8\u30af\u30e9\u30d6", "overview": "The movie takes place in the five-day period before, during and after a ferocious, seemingly liberating typhoon, which five of the students endure while marooned in their school gymnasium.", "poster_path": "/hZ1jQPtkMOft9ncdmFO6QhFplWz.jpg", "release_date": "1985-08-31", "title": "Typhoon Club", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.8, "vote_count": 12, "popularity": 3.315}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/6W7t78vwfDTd6OtuZ5PSTUjJ1MI.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 255982, "original_language": "ko", "original_title": "\ub9cc\ub2e4\ub77c", "overview": "The lives and interactions of two Buddhist monks living in South Korea.", "poster_path": "/oHYzJY95s1mww8duznbg5W6wATU.jpg", "release_date": "1981-09-12", "title": "Mandala", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.7, "vote_count": 11, "popularity": 1.926}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/wTjoi0WI6REnQLcnwldFhfCNHW.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 49571, "original_language": "ja", "original_title": "\u8d64\u3044\u6bba\u610f", "overview": "Sadako, cursed by generations before her and neglected by her common-law husband, falls prey to a brutal home intruder.
