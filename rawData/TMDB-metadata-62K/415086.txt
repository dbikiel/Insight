Well-researched and expertly constructed, Barry Avrich\u2019s eye-opening documentary peels back the layers of the art world economy- from production to circulation, and delineates every integral player in the game of art-making, including curators, gallerists, collectors, donors, auction houses, and \u2026 artists. In the process, he unpacks the complex and surprising ecosystem that supports the art world superstars and million-dollar deals that make front-page news. Featuring extraordinary access to industry players and candid statements from prominent artists like Damien Hirst, Julian Schnabel, Taryn Simon, and Marina Abramovic, Blurred Lines collides the two narratives of the art world as both above and beholden to market forces.", "poster_path": "/91ESE0jyUdq4aABfr4z1lXqSzxz.jpg", "release_date": "2017-04-23", "title": "Blurred Lines: Inside the Art World", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 2.282}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/eyQOgWLnpjzpjZ5X8kEVjE2NwH1.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 85039, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Life 2.0", "overview": "This feature-length documentary follows a group of people whose lives are dramatically transformed by a virtual world -- reshaping relationships, identities, and ultimately the very notion of reality.", "poster_path": "/7PbJrEszBf28v4wML3zHAvLVzSe.jpg", "release_date": "2010-01-22", "title": "Life 2.0", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 14, "popularity": 3.164}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/akLMZglt1odAkknHSV1M6r4k0ka.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 418688, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Blood on the Mountain", "overview": "'Blood on the Mountain' focuses on the environmental and economic injustice and corporate control in West Virginia and its rippling effect on all American workers.
