One is an office worker who also works at 7-11 at night, who also has a pretty fiancee who is being hassled by loan sharks. The other is a gorgeous interior designer. The nightmares happen to them in reality, and start small. The man is attacked by a hand jumping out of a computer keyboard, while videotape attacks the girl. But the nightmare isn't all bad.
