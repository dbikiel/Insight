After an unforgivable betrayal of trust by Peter, Chloe turns their fledgling marriage upside down by moving into her own room and staking out her independence onboard the ship. Drawing attention to the poles within each of us, the impressionistic story oscillates between the super-confined interiors of the ship and the vast open spaces of Antarctica. In the end, it's not until Chloe and Peter are lost - perhaps literally, perhaps metaphorically - in the Antarctic ice that they discover how essential one is to the other.", "popularity": 2.835, "poster_path": "/h7SzxzjcJ9DQ0LamWMOZx25Bx0k.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 39359, "logo_path": null, "name": "Thunder Perfect Mind", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "AR", "name": "Argentina"}, {"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2014-05-31", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 82, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "An antarctic love story", "title": "Red Knot", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.3, "vote_count": 9, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 2676, "name": "honeymoon"}, {"id": 10085, "name": "betrayal"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/7RRuRcGuWkZGuRyYugfXn0Fgrrr.jpg", "genre_ids": [28, 80, 18, 53], "id": 949, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Heat", "overview": "Obsessive master thief, Neil McCauley leads a top-notch crew on various daring heists throughout Los Angeles while determined detective, Vincent Hanna pursues him without rest.
