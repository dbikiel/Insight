Tensions and buried feelings abound, as colleges are chosen and adults behave badly, as Brea, Laura and Tim attempt to hang onto what they have, all the while yearning to break free.", "poster_path": "/5EiP1mW0yA5kovHOYDoJEWLzbRl.jpg", "release_date": "2011-07-09", "title": "The Wise Kids", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 20, "popularity": 4.306}, {"id": 40002, "video": false, "vote_count": 7, "vote_average": 6.1, "title": "Okay", "release_date": "2002-03-27", "original_language": "da", "original_title": "Okay", "genre_ids": [35, 18], "backdrop_path": "/kHwnEiYlYllIKVDLBkHtZDqmTOA.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A bittersweet comedy with dogma star Paprika Steen in the strong leading role.", "poster_path": "/brHFow2DdcsyqalMqk43irnUoQl.jpg", "popularity": 2.366}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/z8WseHKLEWwUAA5nNOgEUrU5E83.jpg", "genre_ids": [10402, 99], "id": 41386, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Fearless Freaks", "overview": "Equal parts punk and psychedelia, the Flaming Lips emerged from Oklahoma City as one of the most bracing bands of the late 1980's. The Fearless Freaks documents their rise from Butthole Surfers-imitating noisemakers to grand poobahs of orchestral pop masterpieces. Filmmaker Bradley Beesely had the good fortune of living in the same neighborhood as lead Lip Wayne Coyne, who quickly enlisted his buddy to document his band's many concerts and assorted exploits. The early footage is a riot, with tragic hair styles on proud display as the boys attempt to cover up their lack of natural talent with sheer volume. During one show, they even have a friend bring a motorcycle on stage, which is then miked for sound and revved throughout the performance, clearing the club with toxic levels of carbon monoxide. Great punk rock stuff. Interspersed among the live bits are interviews with the band's family and friends, revealing the often tragic circumstances of their childhoods and early career.", "poster_path": "/dupLHfDSFy1dsI26bWAuqd3BmVc.jpg", "release_date": "2005-05-25", "title": "The Fearless Freaks", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.1, "vote_count": 8, "popularity": 3.584}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/qX45ZVR3szhO7Jf2vWt4cVlVyC4.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 17073, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "American Swing", "overview": "Chronicles the rise and fall of 1970s New York City nightclub Plato's Retreat.", "poster_path": "/lkWLjr4qzJxwYL2oxAY8PUiuIvB.jpg", "release_date": "2008-01-01", "title": "American Swing", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.8, "vote_count": 9, "popularity": 4.572}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/8sqvbxWAJxv151W6iNNSNa7Lvcm.jpg", "genre_ids": [53, 80, 18], "id": 266425, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Sand Castles", "overview": "In rural Indiana, Noah and his impoverished family wrestle with the mysterious return of his now mute sister, Lauren, who was kidnapped and held captive for over a decade.", "poster_path": "/jrCCmhW5XScYPi4LtBrJ42en0Y4.jpg", "release_date": "2016-02-16", "title": "Sand Castles", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.5, "vote_count": 6, "popularity": 3.702}, {"id": 74310, "video": false, "vote_count": 25, "vote_average": 6.6, "title": "Hell and Back Again", "release_date": "2011-10-04", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Hell and Back Again", "genre_ids": [99], "backdrop_path": "/3270U9Ka9rmEFOGtRPXvi3QzXcD.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "What does it mean to lead men in war?
