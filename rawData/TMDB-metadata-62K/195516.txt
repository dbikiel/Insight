Famous shots from the movie include the first-ever aerial pictures of the tops of Africa's highest peaks, Mt. Kilimanjaro and Mt. Kenya. Along the journey, Martin filmed Osa surrounded by a pride of Lions and together they captured amazing scenes of a baboon colony, an event striking enough to give the movie its name.", "popularity": 1.138, "poster_path": "/oDAjhFyytc4ttz2l34ZXtOibFv3.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1935-01-19", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 73, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Baboona", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4d149251416c91109e33", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1169036, "job": "Director", "name": "Martin E.
