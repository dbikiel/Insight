Major Dellaplane tirelessly matches the dead and the wounded with families' descriptions. Honor and ethics drive him; he hates the idea of \"the unknown soldier.\" Into his sector, looking for her husband, comes a haughty, politically connected Parisian, Madame Ir\u00e8ne de Courtil. Brusquely, Dellaplane offers her 1/350,000th of his time, but as their paths cross and she sees his courage and resolve, feelings change. After he finds a surprising connection between her missing husband and a local teacher, Ir\u00e8ne makes Dellaplane an offer. This man of action hesitates: has he missed his only chance?", "poster_path": "/qoKzFkzOfWw5dOYfLlGIi4sxb5K.jpg", "popularity": 3.459}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/twTm2iMNeZtzJbZQAxF6tH4gbPf.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 84003, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "La naissance de l'amour", "overview": "Writer and Director Phillipe Garrel presents the story of two friends, Paul (played by Lou Castel) and Marcus (played by Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud), both in search of trying to understand what love is and what love really means.

Marcus had some affairs here and there, but keeps thinking about one girl he loved but didn't loved him anymore because of his egocentric behavior.
