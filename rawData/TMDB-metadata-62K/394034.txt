He becomes an overnight sensation after a successful internet campaign against the radical fundamentalism of moral policing in India. This prompts his university teacher - Professor Ranjan Batki, to throw him a challenge for yet another internet campaign that would help raise money via a non-profit Pottery Club for poor people living in Maoists areas of India. Little does Vikram know that he is about to become a part of a plot that would risk his life and the nation. He gets entangled between two corrupt facets of India - Socialism and Capitalism, both of which are deeply rooted in India. It's a story inspired from true life incidents of Underbelly India.", "popularity": 0.778, "poster_path": "/8tFhWXsxdvZLsrFhsI69a9VqO99.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 90949, "logo_path": null, "name": "Friday Night Productions", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "IN", "name": "India"}], "release_date": "2016-05-13", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 114, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "hi", "name": "\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Buddha in a Traffic Jam", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 5, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 0, "character": "Professor Jamshed Batki", "credit_id": "575adc7f9251410b9d000014", "gender": 2, "id": 6217, "name": "Anupam Kher", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/b6xEzU5IjUJXhaFojUpllxIBqUy.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "Vikram Pandit", "credit_id": "575adca9c3a3682d1000001b", "gender": 2, "id": 130589, "name": "Arunoday Singh", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/eVk0WIc3vU0GDf4goH78VFESiBS.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "", "credit_id": "575adcbec3a3682d0900001e", "gender": 1, "id": 86085, "name": "Mahie Gill", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/pfln1aBHNO6CfW9WF6KqbG9aCdM.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 1, "character": "Mrs Batki", "credit_id": "575adc99c3a3682d10000018", "gender": 0, "id": 1042821, "name": "Pallavi Joshi", "order": 3, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Naxal Chief", "credit_id": "575adce5c3a3682d09000023", "gender": 0, "id": 1047717, "name": "Gopal Singh", "order": 4, "profile_path": null}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "592dcfa5c3a36808e0000a6a", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 126763, "job": "Director", "name": "Vivek Agnihotri", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "592dcfae92514168f0000a42", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 126763, "job": "Writer", "name": "Vivek Agnihotri", "profile_path": null}]}}
