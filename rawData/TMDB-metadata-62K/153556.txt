Echoing Dziga Vertov\u2019s concepts and Eadweard Muybridge\u2019s techniques (shooting only one or two frames per second), Andersen masterfully brings forward what makes Souto de Moura an original: the incorporation of the passing of time into architectural designs, positing them within a history fraught with class struggle and societal changes, in a continuum with ruins\u2014from which they may originate, and to which they will return\u2014and with nature\u2014which they frame, and by which they are framed.", "popularity": 1.38, "poster_path": "/1i87KU18vIesF5Q6mKBR0rxyb2y.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "PT", "name": "Portugal"}], "release_date": "2012-08-11", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 68, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "pt", "name": "Portugu\u00eas"}, {"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Reconvers\u00e3o", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4b469251416c910d5417", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 120969, "job": "Director", "name": "Thom Andersen", "profile_path": "/AgqAplydKlWWIpQgJd8lZSvV2u3.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "55346555c3a36852de002aa6", "department": "Camera", "gender": 0, "id": 1130244, "job": "Director of Photography", "name": "Peter Bo Rappmund", "profile_path": "/zHkoXY8qUcXNzAxL8b8eQgMeNCC.jpg"}]}}
