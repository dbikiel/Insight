The filmmaker and artist begins on Lake Superior, then explores winding and sometimes tortuous river waters to the meadowlands of the river's source. Along the way, Mason paints scenes that capture his attention and muses about his love of the canoe, his artwork and his own sense of the land. Mason also uses the film as a commentary on the link between God and nature and the vast array of beautiful canvases God created for him to paint. Features breathtaking visuals and exciting whitewater footage, with a musical score by Bruce Cockburn.", "popularity": 0.6, "poster_path": "/8a2tjc4yavP2JbQbVoDfjRVp4pC.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1984-01-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 87, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Waterwalker", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "577dec7dc3a36817ea005cb8", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 93168, "job": "Director", "name": "Bill Mason", "profile_path": null}]}}
