The Occupation of the American Mind takes an eye-opening look at this critical exception, zeroing in on pro-Israel public relations efforts within the U.S. Narrated by Roger Waters and featuring leading observers of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and U.S. media culture, the film explores how the Israeli government, the U.S. government, and the pro-Israel lobby have joined forces, often with very different motives, to shape American media coverage of the conflict in Israel's favor, and provides a sweeping analysis of Israel's decades-long battle for the hearts, minds, and tax dollars of the American people in the face of widening international condemnation of its increasingly right-wing policies.", "popularity": 1.221, "poster_path": "/rCqkjI3mhLPaTnZYc0u4Okkycij.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 27072, "logo_path": null, "name": "Media Education Foundation", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2016-01-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": null, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "nl", "name": "Nederlands"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Occupation of the American Mind", "video": false, "vote_average": 8.0, "vote_count": 4, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 0, "character": "Narrator", "credit_id": "59481cc2c3a36816f6045d42", "gender": 2, "id": 67273, "name": "Roger Waters", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/fsYU6JmY42ZEipmpQJU13buJeM6.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 1, "character": "Herself", "credit_id": "59481cd7c3a368265f02406f", "gender": 1, "id": 133258, "name": "Rula Jebreal", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/pkl0qddMmC8g3IJc7LCXVRi2o10.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "59bad4eec3a36863d0002d1f", "gender": 2, "id": 116488, "name": "Noam Chomsky", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/8AzdnaF732PdbQMZZEj861SJnKE.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "59bad510c3a368639a002eed", "gender": 0, "id": 227957, "name": "Norman Finkelstein", "order": 4, "profile_path": "/lbqVOdmGeLTlv783Ze2G6fmPIxe.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "59481d019251413fb6043c32", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1297594, "job": "Director", "name": "Loretta Alper", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "59481d1a9251413ff40445cb", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 223418, "job": "Director", "name": "Jeremy Earp", "profile_path": null}]}}
