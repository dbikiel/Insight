In all waters, daphnia abound. They are crustaceans about 2 ml long, with one eye that turns in all directions. Antennae enable daphnia to move: in a close up magnified 150,000 times, we see the muscles of the antennae pulse. We see the eye, the nerve mass, blood globules, and the heart, beating several times per second. The intestine forms a long line. All are females; eggs develop above the intestine. New generations come rapidly. Inside each daphnia are tiny infusoria; we watch them clean the intestine of a dead daphnia. An enemy, the hydra, approaches. A daphnia dies, but many remain.", "poster_path": "/yH2WdpqJmLpXMRgpigc8uaLZD8h.jpg", "popularity": 1.145}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 189495, "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "Cinq minutes de cin\u00e9ma pur", "overview": "Avant-garde short focused on the pure elements of film like form, visual composition, and rhythm.", "poster_path": "/9j60uN74DMpwhaDeHNg5j49pWbA.jpg", "release_date": "1926-01-01", "title": "Five Minutes of Pure Cinema", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 10, "popularity": 1.439}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 163085, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Jam Session", "overview": "Duke Ellington and Orchestra perform 'C Jam Blues'.", "poster_path": "/j2Y7rsDvh1mYwDpVLcCco9dQA8v.jpg", "release_date": "1942-01-01", "title": "Jam Session", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 10, "popularity": 0.993}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [18], "id": 130838, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Valse Triste", "overview": "With a similar dreamy mood like its predecessor \"Take the 5:10 to Dreamland\" (1976) this clip starts with a boy getting into his bed. The camera zooms in into the boy's mind and a slow, sad waltz (i.e.\"Valse Triste\") accompanies images of a locomotive, a miner, the globe, the sky, a sheep heard, etc. Disparate elements, but if one concentrates only at the movement of the figures, one can perceive a commotion, slowly livening up: The starting wheels of the heavy locomotive, the tired miner pushing the heavy cart of coal bricks, the globe smoothly turning around and around, the clouds imperceptibly floating in the sky, the sheep idly moving in the herd, etc.  We reach the first climax when a mannequin opens her coat like a flower. The second big crescendo spurts out from a \"water hose\", after watching schoolgirls doing gymnastics for quite a while. A sad, but nostalgic aftertaste lingers in the end when funeral cars drive away through a flooded area\u2026", "poster_path": "/fsLJMk1dPfzr5qXd3IRSmZRxpX6.jpg", "release_date": "1977-06-01", "title": "Valse Triste", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 9, "popularity": 2.37}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99, 10402], "id": 147018, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Marian Anderson: The Lincoln Memorial Concert", "overview": "Short film which documents Marian Anderson's singing performance at the Lincoln Memorial.", "poster_path": "/A152t27IHaWbF5t2OxXzb8BfAs8.jpg", "release_date": "1939-12-31", "title": "Marian Anderson: The Lincoln Memorial Concert", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.8, "vote_count": 9, "popularity": 1.55}], "total_pages": 2, "total_results": 40}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe49c79251416c750d2fa5", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 131470, "job": "Director", "name": "Paul Strand", "profile_path": "/10rw1BdClbxzfwGEMJaj8GJEZyW.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "52fe49c79251416c750d2fab", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1281722, "job": "Director", "name": "Charles Sheeler", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "56c3303c9251414b0a001bb4", "department": "Visual Effects", "gender": 0, "id": 1578446, "job": "Visual Effects", "name": "Sarah McGrail", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5bb8f334c3a36824280115a3", "department": "Camera", "gender": 2, "id": 131470, "job": "Director of Photography", "name": "Paul Strand", "profile_path": "/10rw1BdClbxzfwGEMJaj8GJEZyW.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "5bb8f34cc3a368241f01554e", "department": "Camera", "gender": 0, "id": 1281722, "job": "Director of Photography", "name": "Charles Sheeler", "profile_path": null}]}}
