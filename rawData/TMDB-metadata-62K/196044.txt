Among them is The Responsive Eye, which chronicles the Museum Of Modern Art\u2019s 1965 exhibition of op-art. Curated by William Seitz, this was the first significant exhibit of optical art synchronous with and in some cases arising out of the early days of psychedelic culture. It\u2019s amusing to watch the stuffed shirts within the art world attempt to describe what they are looking at in conventional terms or resorting to psychological mumbo jumbo without ever mentioning mescaline or LSD.", "poster_path": "/aTnurJD9Hx9krPVFgen5o3l3t8i.jpg", "release_date": "1966-01-01", "title": "The Responsive Eye", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.5, "vote_count": 4, "popularity": 0.6}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 365147, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Now That You Are Gone", "overview": "A surreal encounter at P\u00e8re Lachaise cemetery between a brightly coloured jelly pudding, tomb stones and Mickey Mouse.", "poster_path": "/xQliSse9TsWy0RZ9HF6XJ5ZtOjp.jpg", "release_date": "1977-10-24", "title": "Now That You Are Gone", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.5, "vote_count": 4, "popularity": 0.6}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99], "id": 195653, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Scene from the Elevator Ascending Eiffel Tower", "overview": "\u201cA marvelously clear picture taken from the top of the elevator of the Eiffel Tower during going up and coming down of the car.

Arriving at the top of the tower, a bird's eye view of the Exposition looking toward the Trocadero, and also toward the Palace of Electricity, is made, and the camera begins its descent.
