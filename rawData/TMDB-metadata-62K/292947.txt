From 1980 to 1990 they were billed as Exude.  They had a college playlist hit with \"Boys Just Want to Have Sex\" and got two videos on MTV. In 1990 they changed their name to NC-17 and revamped their style into a grungier more Floyd-influenced sound.  Filmmaker Dov Kelemer made a documentary of their career struggles. Once the movie was completed--it played on cable, at film festivals, and a few theaters.  It's available from the www.anybodylisten.com site.  NC-17 has since become inactive, as the members have scattered over several different states. Lead vocalist Frank Rogala remains active on the OC music scene.", "popularity": 0.901, "poster_path": "/zegJt5EF98kx3KfQgP6Jyafjptc.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2001-09-28", "revenue": 0, "runtime": null, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Won't Anybody Listen", "video": false, "vote_average": 8.0, "vote_count": 2, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 0, "character": "himself", "credit_id": "565bc0ef92514169280051bc", "gender": 0, "id": 1542646, "name": "Frank Rogala", "order": 1, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 1, "character": "himself", "credit_id": "565bc0fe925141692b0054be", "gender": 0, "id": 1542647, "name": "Vince Rogala", "order": 2, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "himself", "credit_id": "565bc10d92514169250055c0", "gender": 0, "id": 1542648, "name": "Robin Canada", "order": 3, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "herself", "credit_id": "565bc11c92514169280051d6", "gender": 0, "id": 1542649, "name": "Nancy Rogala", "order": 4, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "herself", "credit_id": "565bc12c925141691b00563f", "gender": 0, "id": 1542650, "name": "Katherine Turman", "order": 5, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 11, "character": "himself", "credit_id": "5681929ec3a36860e9010f66", "gender": 0, "id": 1554949, "name": "Jim Washburn", "order": 6, "profile_path": null}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "565bc185c3a3685069005756", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1542651, "job": "Director", "name": "Dov Kelemer", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "56819147c3a368227b0075b7", "department": "Camera", "gender": 2, "id": 978596, "job": "Director of Photography", "name": "Dominic Pereira", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "56819200c3a3684be9010d4f", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 1554948, "job": "Executive Producer", "name": "Lyn Jensen", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "568192189251414ecb002dd5", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 1542646, "job": "Executive Producer", "name": "Frank Rogala", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "56819230c3a3684be3011c7e", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 1542647, "job": "Executive Producer", "name": "Vince Rogala", "profile_path": null}]}}
