From the Swiss Alps to eastern Poland, from Stromboli to Iceland. Always following the scenery's magically charged contours. Immersing yourself, letting yourself be infected, then travelling on. Roman Signer determines the route that we are moving on and the film improvises along the way.  Being on the road also means tracking down the right places. Signer brings them alive using his own personel instruments, brilliantly simple operations full of subtle humour. \u00abSimple\u00bb poems being transmitted into space with INSTRUMENTS as gunpowder, fuse, rubber boots, balloons, stool, small table ... and a three wheelded Plaggio.  SIGNERS KOFFER is also a journey through the state of mind. A tightrope walk between fun and melancholy. Danger also mental mental danger becomes the stimulus of the senses. Sudden crashes, abrupt chagnes of mood determine the rythm and atmosphere of this cinematic journey.", "popularity": 0.665, "poster_path": "/pM7ALDIXZbCeZ5HNLZgAdVwG0jL.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CH", "name": "Switzerland"}], "release_date": "1995-04-10", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 84, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "pl", "name": "Polski"}, {"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}, {"iso_639_1": "it", "name": "Italiano"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Signer's Suitcase", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 3, "character": "", "credit_id": "58f074fd92514125b800c6f2", "gender": 0, "id": 1795753, "name": "Roman Signer", "order": 1, "profile_path": null}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "5527a324c3a3687993000f23", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 222866, "job": "Director", "name": "Peter Liechti", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "58f074af925141259800bf1d", "department": "Writing", "gender": 2, "id": 222866, "job": "Writer", "name": "Peter Liechti", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "58f074b8c3a3686b2100be83", "department": "Crew", "gender": 2, "id": 222866, "job": "Cinematography", "name": "Peter Liechti", "profile_path": null}]}}
