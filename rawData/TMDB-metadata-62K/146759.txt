An unofficial sequel to 'Born Free' (1966) and 'Living Free' (1972), which also dramatised the life of Adamson, this film picks up the life of George (Richard Harris) on the African wildlife preserve he runs with the help of his brother Terrence (Ian Bannen). When drifter Tony Fitzjohn (John Michie) arrives to work for the old men he initially takes poorly to the task, almost savaged by a lion on his first day and on the verge of leaving when he hears that his predecessor was killed in a similar incident. The arrival of a lion cub that Fitzjohn must care for and raise changes everything. Soon he finds himself helping the brothers in their fight to save lions - and, ultimately, the park itself - from the poachers, soldiers and corrupt government officials that threaten them.", "popularity": 3.258, "poster_path": "/4cKNcbeYav6JN7lrMaucpZ8oo8k.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 4794, "logo_path": null, "name": "Studio Eight Productions", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 26793, "logo_path": null, "name": "Kingsborough Greenlight Pictures", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "KE", "name": "Kenya"}, {"iso_3166_1": "CA", "name": "Canada"}, {"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "1999-06-04", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 110, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "To Walk with Lions", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.7, "vote_count": 7, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 409, "name": "africa"}, {"id": 2043, "name": "lion"}, {"id": 5565, "name": "biography"}, {"id": 8723, "name": "poacher"}, {"id": 9895, "name": "kenya"}, {"id": 9896, "name": "lion cub"}, {"id": 194699, "name": "game reserve"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 606, "video": false, "vote_count": 697, "vote_average": 7.3, "title": "Out of Africa", "release_date": "1985-12-20", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Out of Africa", "genre_ids": [18, 36, 10749], "backdrop_path": "/uMPrCi5DA0kuIeZGjoE7FPGqETW.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Out of Africa tells the story of the life of Danish author Karen Blixen, who at the beginning of the 20th century moved to Africa to build a new life for herself.
