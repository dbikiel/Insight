At fifteen years old and in his last year of junior high school, he breathed, ate and slept hockey. He collected hockey cards, played street hockey with his friends, tried skating and ice hockey for the first time in his life, but was most fascinated with his local national league team, the Montr\u00e9al Canadiens, and its star player, Henri Richard. He dreamed of growing up and working for the Canadiens franchise. But a more immediate goal was to get tickets to one of their games, using M. Richard and his banker father, Herv\u00e9, as possible conduits to that goal.", "popularity": 0.707, "poster_path": "/sIW1JIcnL8ejX8a0WbN9KzlEReP.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CA", "name": "Canada"}], "release_date": "1999-02-26", "revenue": 138411, "runtime": 105, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "A tribute to friendship and to hockey!", "title": "Winter Stories", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 2, "character": "", "credit_id": "5d4727d5a0be280454a4e50e", "gender": 0, "id": 2378800, "name": "Patrick Thomas", "order": 1, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "", "credit_id": "5d4727ff00fb6b00150a6aaa", "gender": 0, "id": 7016, "name": "Diane Lavall\u00e9e", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/x30zRxldXHnUZno7p4GaO6BvS6i.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "", "credit_id": "5d47282ba0be280454a4e554", "gender": 2, "id": 554829, "name": "Luc Gu\u00e9rin", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/el2w516zQl7CeUgn9s9WyZhMzgg.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "", "credit_id": "5d472839109cd0001495a1f3", "gender": 2, "id": 543221, "name": "Denis Bouchard", "order": 4, "profile_path": "/hXuBcKcvUmiF3rsUTU8OHeTmCxN.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 6, "character": "", "credit_id": "5d472844c1e56e001365ae73", "gender": 1, "id": 263303, "name": "Suzanne Champagne", "order": 5, "profile_path": "/dl0HrWhLCwqf6MOap0WpRTNFxab.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 7, "character": "", "credit_id": "5d47285c2d1e405083bdf59f", "gender": 0, "id": 59615, "name": "Robert Toupin", "order": 6, "profile_path": null}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe49e8c3a368484e1468c7", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 543714, "job": "Director", "name": "Fran\u00e7ois Bouvier", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5d4728a500fb6b00130a6c2e", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 543714, "job": "Screenplay", "name": "Fran\u00e7ois Bouvier", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5d472942a0be2823dca1e329", "department": "Editing", "gender": 0, "id": 1195873, "job": "Editor", "name": "Andr\u00e9 Corriveau", "profile_path": null}]}}
