But, he comes back to life as a zombie with a huge penis. He continues his rapist and killing rampage. There are two cops that follows the case, one of them is mentally altered. Thats a great character! A very good performance by that guy. Other highlight is the \"flying baby doll\". No words. Its the glory. The movie is very enjoyable but not expect \"good cinema\" or \"art\". Its a party movie, to watch with friends drinking beer and puking.
