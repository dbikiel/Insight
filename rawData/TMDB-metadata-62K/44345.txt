But her idyllic view of her new job is sorely tested after she meets her surly boss, named Killer, and discovers that winding roads can prove treacherous in winter, especially with a faulty clutch. Through her cheeky humour and oblique look at the reality of people living in the Quebec countryside, Tali delivers a film that is unique, witty and touching.  - Written by NFB", "poster_path": "/uPTpDYwYdv5SRY4kNiv9xoMe7BO.jpg", "popularity": 1.299}], "total_pages": 2, "total_results": 22}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "52fe4684c3a36847f8103663", "gender": 2, "id": 1032, "name": "Martin Scorsese", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/4Xwx5XL1RJj0JQmEo8Fhr6nkpOg.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "52fe4684c3a36847f8103667", "gender": 2, "id": 138, "name": "Quentin Tarantino", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/9ci4NBvHXJktxjALdJsrtasqgtV.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "Herself", "credit_id": "52fe4684c3a36847f810366b", "gender": 1, "id": 1038, "name": "Jodie Foster", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/eAIE6bnOQ8rm0f933gyeAQdIwrP.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "52fe4684c3a36847f810366f", "gender": 2, "id": 488, "name": "Steven Spielberg", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/pOK15UNaw75Bzj7BQO1ulehbPPm.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "52fe4684c3a36847f8103673", "gender": 2, "id": 2710, "name": "James Cameron", "order": 4, "profile_path": "/zy2foCd8PEtvCcsX48cROdQdDLB.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 6, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "52fe4684c3a36847f8103677", "gender": 2, "id": 2228, "name": "Sean Penn", "order": 5, "profile_path": "/ntbrVhRwa77NCTUPTK3qt01b3n4.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 8, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "52fe4684c3a36847f810367b", "gender": 2, "id": 5140, "name": "Wes Craven", "order": 6, "profile_path": "/vffssPtgNn2ZwoMfLCCDJAxlXGI.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 9, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "52fe4684c3a36847f810367f", "gender": 2, "id": 1, "name": "George Lucas", "order": 7, "profile_path": "/8qxin8urtFE0NqaZNFWOuV537bH.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 10, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "52fe4684c3a36847f8103683", "gender": 2, "id": 10491, "name": "Paul Verhoeven", "order": 8, "profile_path": "/mlIV2V9OYcnmudqv1iZw7QrdSSh.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 29, "character": "Narrator (voice)", "credit_id": "52fe4684c3a36847f81036f3", "gender": 1, "id": 8534, "name": "Kathy Bates", "order": 9, "profile_path": "/yik6ccz1O2JelLJn3Fsx3EA8s1o.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 30, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "52fe4684c3a36847f81036f7", "gender": 2, "id": 4671, "name": "Zach Staenberg", "order": 10, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 31, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "52fe4684c3a36847f81036fb", "gender": 2, "id": 908, "name": "Michael Tronick", "order": 11, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 32, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "52fe4684c3a36847f81036ff", "gender": 2, "id": 2239, "name": "Anthony Minghella", "order": 12, "profile_path": "/uJirGbZdLlvIs3joWGVNpPWKzPz.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 33, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "52fe4684c3a36847f8103703", "gender": 2, "id": 154, "name": "Walter Murch", "order": 13, "profile_path": "/7ZUPk0aT7IBm4xPeILzm8dUrl48.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 34, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "52fe4684c3a36847f8103707", "gender": 2, "id": 18878, "name": "Rob Cohen", "order": 14, "profile_path": "/qMtAaURL6aE3GgALVQlxKGGL5AC.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 35, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "52fe4684c3a36847f810370b", "gender": 2, "id": 12509, "name": "Antony Gibbs", "order": 15, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 36, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "52fe4684c3a36847f810370f", "gender": 2, "id": 898, "name": "Mark Goldblatt", "order": 16, "profile_path": "/hlqnD5u4M3SP3aqsMKLmQ3A9CdT.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 37, "character": "Herself", "credit_id": "52fe4684c3a36847f8103713", "gender": 1, "id": 156, "name": "Sally Menke", "order": 17, "profile_path": "/8cUdiGU7KhBgd8UNnoUYNCMZYgQ.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4684c3a36847f81036b9", "department": "Production", "gender": 2, "id": 853, "job": "Executive Producer", "name": "Alan Heim", "profile_path": "/61v52Sbu2XjJcf3lxkWunEdCXW0.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "52fe4684c3a36847f81036e3", "department": "Camera", "gender": 2, "id": 1527, "job": "Director of Photography", "name": "John Bailey", "profile_path": "/tjWixq3gm3D1Sspx882aP6GogLl.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "52fe4684c3a36847f81036e9", "department": "Editing", "gender": 2, "id": 58706, "job": "Editor", "name": "Daniel Loewenthal", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe4684c3a36847f81036dd", "department": "Sound", "gender": 0, "id": 965139, "job": "Original Music Composer", "name": "Nic.
