During the Soviet rule artists who stay true to their vision are executed, sent to mental hospitals or Gulags.  Their plight inspires young Igor Savitsky. He pretends to buy state-approved art but instead daringly rescues 40,000 forbidden fellow artist's works and creates a museum in the desert of Uzbekistan, far from the watchful eyes of the KGB. Though a penniless artist himself, he cajoles the cash to pay for the art from the same authorities who are banning it. Savitsky amasses an eclectic mix of Russian Avant-Garde art. But his greatest discovery is an unknown school of artists who settle in Uzbekistan after the Russian revolution of 1917, encountering a unique Islamic culture, as exotic to them as Tahiti was for Gauguin. They develop a startlingly original style, fusing European modernism with centuries-old Eastern traditions.", "popularity": 1.63, "poster_path": "/qbnDE8UVhP4bWYpR8CbrI0GTHB5.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2011-03-18", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 80, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Desert of Forbidden Art", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 2, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 2111, "name": "soviet union"}, {"id": 2598, "name": "museum"}, {"id": 154866, "name": "archival footage"}, {"id": 187056, "name": "woman director"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 9813, "video": false, "vote_count": 128, "vote_average": 6.1, "title": "The Quiet", "release_date": "2005-09-12", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Quiet", "genre_ids": [18, 53], "backdrop_path": "/6eyWAZA4CEidZW1xXnQ4vlYBXTP.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "After her widowed father dies, deaf teenager Dot moves in with her godparents, Olivia and Paul Deer.
