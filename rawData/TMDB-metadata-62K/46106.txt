All hopes, from the villagers and women to close family members, turn to Shigeko, the Lieutenant's wife. She must honor the Emperor and the country in setting an example for all by fulfilling her duty and taking care of the 'god soldier'. Kurokawa prior to leaving to fight in the war regularly beat and berated his wife for her barrenness and inability to bring him a son. When he returns home as an amputee with no hearing and no speech, his wife dutifully attends to him, even though he shows little appreciation for her dedicated care. His main concerns are getting fed and getting sex. Even in his own degraded condition, he manages to berate his wife. Eventually, though, his own memories infiltrate and he is haunted by his horrible, sadistic deeds, performed while in the duty of the Japanese military.", "popularity": 1.372, "poster_path": "/6t2PTbqaY6xvCVzRiWicnzm7xfk.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 90891, "logo_path": null, "name": "Skhole Co.", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 13247, "logo_path": null, "name": "Wakamatsu Production", "origin_country": "JP"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "JP", "name": "Japan"}], "release_date": "2010-08-14", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 87, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ja", "name": "\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Caterpillar", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.4, "vote_count": 10, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 233, "name": "japan"}, {"id": 1327, "name": "war crimes"}, {"id": 1956, "name": "world war ii"}, {"id": 33756, "name": "deaf"}, {"id": 184343, "name": "quadriplegic"}, {"id": 207765, "name": "wife beater"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/qtD2lFLG5T7L8flbKSEIoSqcslI.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 10752], "id": 7862, "original_language": "de", "original_title": "Die F\u00e4lscher", "overview": "The story Jewish counterfeiter, Salomon Sorowitsch, coerced into assisting the Nazi operation of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp during World War II.", "poster_path": "/bRQddrgVemZtFdnrPy9AxTpkhpj.jpg", "release_date": "2007-02-09", "title": "The Counterfeiters", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.4, "vote_count": 261, "popularity": 12.463}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/pKawqrtCBMmxarft7o1LbEynys7.jpg", "genre_ids": [10752, 18, 28], "id": 228150, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Fury", "overview": "In the last months of World War II, as the Allies make their final push in the European theatre, a battle-hardened U.S. Army sergeant named 'Wardaddy' commands a Sherman tank called 'Fury' and its five-man crew on a deadly mission behind enemy lines.
