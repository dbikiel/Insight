Its subject is Scorsese's friend Steven Prince, best known for his small role as Easy Andy, the gun salesman in Taxi Driver. Prince is a raconteur telling stories about his life as an ex-drug addict and a road manager for Neil Diamond. Scorsese intersperses home movies of Prince as a child as he talks about his family. When talking of his years as a heroin addict, Prince tells a story about injecting adrenaline into the heart of a woman who overdosed, with the help of a medical dictionary and a Magic Marker. This story was re-enacted by Quentin Tarantino in his screenplay for Pulp Fiction. Prince also tells a story about his days working at a gas station, and having to shoot a man he caught stealing tires, after the man pulled out a knife and tried to attack him. This story was retold in the Richard Linklater film Waking Life.", "popularity": 3.598, "poster_path": "/wkO5AREOY70PEMxRxkvgRYDq1Ak.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1978-09-16", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 55, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "American Boy: A Profile of Steven Prince", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.9, "vote_count": 13, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 91459, "video": false, "vote_count": 24, "vote_average": 6.9, "title": "Italianamerican", "release_date": "1974-01-01", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Italianamerican", "genre_ids": [99], "backdrop_path": null, "adult": false, "overview": "Filmmaker Martin Scorsese interviews his mother and father about their life in New York and family history back in Sicily.", "poster_path": "/tjgdUbhf4e6SsBQfYl4IaczRNoR.jpg", "popularity": 2.694}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/dlB2QavyWtnSnsepB25igKYWuBJ.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 274906, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The 50 Year Argument", "overview": "Directed by acclaimed filmmaker Martin Scorsese and his longtime documentary collaborator David Tedeschi, A 50 Year Argument rides the waves of literary, political, and cultural history as charted by the The New York Review of Books, America\u2019s leading journal of ideas for over 50 years.

Confrontation and original argument are in the Review's DNA - the magazine seems as vital now as when it was run by its indefatigable founding editors, Robert Silvers and the late Barbara Epstein.
