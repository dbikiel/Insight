Rouqier concentrates on a single French farm family, following them through the four seasons.

The final symbolic images of Spring, achieved through time-lapse photography, are almost unbearably beautiful. The winner of several festival awards, Farrebique nonetheless did not immediately result in an outpouring of financing for Rouqier's follow-up films (this was a common problem in the financially strapped French film industry of the 1940s). Perhaps as a result, Rouqier did not make his sequel, Biquefarre (filmed in the same region, with some of the same \"actors\"), until 1983.", "poster_path": "/rx81Dh44AxQnTtDJqrlFPptvJk5.jpg", "release_date": "1946-09-01", "title": "Farrebique, or the Four Seasons", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 1.139}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/pDRDKMcMuUwQREoewmwwO2MWxmQ.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 91288, "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "Le monde sans soleil", "overview": "Fascinating underwater documentary filmed with hand-held cameras by frogmen and mostly filmed in deep-water seas from within a special designed batiscaff, by the Cousteau family of sea explorers.", "poster_path": "/yMkrePst0VifixrwplTfU8PY5jf.jpg", "release_date": "1964-12-22", "title": "World Without Sun", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 8, "popularity": 2.322}], "total_pages": 2, "total_results": 40}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "Dr. Nils Hellstrom", "credit_id": "52fe474e9251416c75094a75", "gender": 2, "id": 6564, "name": "Lawrence Pressman", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/mot6LcTgUnZKd1U60iZNxytNpdQ.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe474e9251416c75094a7b", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 7765, "job": "Director", "name": "Walon Green", "profile_path": "/k2b1jMV9nq5H2JLj4Pv3LiqKxJG.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "52fe474e9251416c75094a81", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 82444, "job": "Director", "name": "Ed Spiegel", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe474e9251416c75094a87", "department": "Writing", "gender": 2, "id": 11834, "job": "Author", "name": "David Seltzer", "profile_path": "/xrpGKYuDVkTJe6bjMDPgGdbEpR6.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "5806fb9cc3a3684e8b0101e9", "department": "Sound", "gender": 2, "id": 9217, "job": "Original Music Composer", "name": "Lalo Schifrin", "profile_path": "/zYz8R5xJGdO4Rq2FrcagMoG1UxD.jpg"}]}}
