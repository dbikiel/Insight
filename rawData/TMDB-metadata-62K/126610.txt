RR comes three decades after Benning and Bette Gordon made The United States of America (1975), a cinematic journey along the country\u2019s interstates that is keenly aware \u201cof superhighways and railroad tracks as American public symbols.\u201d A political essay responding to the economic histories of trains as instruments in a culture of hyper-consumption, RR articulates its concern most explicitly when Eisenhower's military-industrial complex speech is heard as a mile long coal train passes through eastern Wyoming. Benning spent two and a half years collecting two hundred and sixteen shots of trains, forty-three of which appear in RR. The locomotives' varying colors, speeds, vectors, and reverberations are charged with visual thrills, romance and a nostalgia heightened by Benning's declaration that this will be his last work in 16mm film.", "popularity": 1.387, "poster_path": "/4hxV9O86MOBA8JgBWVnmuri3WtZ.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}, {"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2007-11-02", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 115, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "RR", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4ae3c3a368484e16c261", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 1012088, "job": "Director", "name": "James Benning", "profile_path": "/zmBy4E6njaoj1z8ZWTj11i8t1Q2.jpg"}]}}
