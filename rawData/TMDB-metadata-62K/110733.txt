Richard Kaplan's lively documentary reveals the human face behind the American icon, beginning with the emotional deprivation suffered by this plain, awkward little girl born into a socially prominent and powerful family. Though she would eventually marry a man who would look beyond her awkwardness, Eleanor was not content to be the proper, silent wife to her husband Franklin's extraordinary political career. Instead, she began a lifelong crusade to speak out about injustice and oppression in any form.", "poster_path": "/fmKMKRqCVDYP6sIUw1HLRCCP8Kd.jpg", "release_date": "1965-11-08", "title": "The Eleanor Roosevelt Story", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 2.529}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [10752, 99], "id": 126783, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Spanish Earth", "overview": "A propaganda film made during the Spanish Civil War in support of the Republican government against the rebellion by Gen.
