The film follows their adventures together on the street, through encounters with husky-voiced seductresses, mumbling erotic accessory salesmen and shopaholic swingers. Navigating the bizarre fetishes and sexual needs of their 'dates' brings into focus the hilarious and pathetic disparity between the two hookers, fellow travelers who will share the road together but only for a while.", "popularity": 1.429, "poster_path": "/viWnfGc4FpMEdgBXf2nubFQU5D0.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 64806, "logo_path": null, "name": "Wisconsin", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2013-08-09", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 81, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Foxy Merkins", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.8, "vote_count": 4, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 187056, "name": "woman director"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/rf6G51j0SZL0tP57I8gnqHTRFEr.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 18, 10749], "id": 273153, "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "La belle saison", "overview": "In 1971, Carole and Delphine meet and fall in love in Paris.
