Other scenes included a staged murder of a rabbi, a crucified chicken, a giant vagina giving birth to Jodorowsky, naked women covered in honey and the throwing of live turtles into the audience.", "poster_path": "/zTzyOTECIsDh96biLRTViEcULqz.jpg", "release_date": "1965-01-01", "title": "Melodrama Sacramental", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.8, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 1.4}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [35], "id": 83219, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "When Nature Calls", "overview": "When construction worker Greg becomes fed-up with his foreman and the \"city life\", he takes his wife and kids on a wilderness adventure.", "poster_path": "/o87lvBVcFXfeSqPpZsbBKuTvSth.jpg", "release_date": "1985-09-13", "title": "When Nature Calls", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.3, "vote_count": 3, "popularity": 2.854}, {"id": 49899, "video": true, "vote_count": 7, "vote_average": 7.3, "title": "1/2 Man", "release_date": "1986-07-06", "original_language": "de", "original_title": "1/2 Mensch", "genre_ids": [99, 10402], "backdrop_path": "/ajH5yNJ2HV3YoNpLeGEyFVZQr4g.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A visual documentary of Einstuerzende Neubauten, the German underground band, by Japanese cult director Sogo Ishii, made during their 1985 tour of Japan.
