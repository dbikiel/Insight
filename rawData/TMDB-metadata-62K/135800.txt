No Logo is the warning on the label.  In the last decade, No Logo has become a cultural manifesto for the critics of unfettered capitalism worldwide. As the world faces a second economic depression, No Logo's analysis of our corporate and branded world is as timely and powerful as ever.  Equal parts cultural analysis, political manifesto, mall-rat memoir, and journalistic expos\u00e9, No Logo is the first book to put the new resistance into pop-historical and clear economic perspective. It tells a story of rebellion and self-determination in the face of our new branded world.", "popularity": 0.697, "poster_path": "/lh7Zy2pcAf56wRIQiGq523zPqJr.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2003-07-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 42, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "Brands, Globalization & Resistance", "title": "No Logo: Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.3, "vote_count": 3, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "Herself", "credit_id": "53bdfea30e0a2615890030d3", "gender": 1, "id": 125505, "name": "Naomi Klein", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/sI1Qz81mne1iMeHmbooaZYKzPKZ.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "53bdfe7e0e0a2615890030cf", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1184450, "job": "Director", "name": "Sut Jhally", "profile_path": null}]}}
