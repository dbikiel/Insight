It\u2019s the story of big money-drugs that fuel a $330 billion psychiatric industry, without a single cure. The cost in human terms is even greater-these drugs now kill an estimated 42,000 people every year. And the death count keeps rising. Containing more than 175 interviews with lawyers, mental health experts, the families of victims and the survivors themselves, this riveting documentary rips the mask off psychotropic drugging and exposes a brutal but well-entrenched money-making machine. Before these drugs were introduced in the market, people who had these conditions would not have been given any drugs at all. So it is the branding of a disease and it is the branding of a drug for a treatment of a disease that did not exist before the industry made the disease.", "popularity": 0.746, "poster_path": "/ml0EjDg8voHHBXvDgDyGg1HBcLv.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2008-10-24", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 95, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Making a Killing: The Untold Story of Psychotropic Drugging", "video": false, "vote_average": 9.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 1279, "name": "medicine"}, {"id": 2800, "name": "psychology"}, {"id": 6135, "name": "pharmaceutical industry"}, {"id": 10638, "name": "pharmacology"}, {"id": 11494, "name": "drug use"}, {"id": 41329, "name": "mental illness"}, {"id": 190700, "name": "health and safety"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/z3s3TdRvEWC1TFrwtk0qhB7OdHh.jpg", "genre_ids": [27, 53], "id": 12662, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Psycho III", "overview": "Norman Bates is still running his little motel, and he has kept the dressed skeleton he calls 'mother'.
