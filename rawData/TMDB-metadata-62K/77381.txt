It is named after Zorn's lemma (also known as the Kuratowski\u2013Zorn lemma), a proposition of set theory formulated by mathematician Max Zorn in 1935.  Zorns Lemma is prefaced with a reading from an early grammar textbook. The remainder of the film, largely silent, shows the viewer an evolving 24-part \"alphabet\" (composed initially of street signs photographed in New York City) which is cycled through, replaced and expanded upon. The film's conclusion shows a man, woman and dog walking through snow as several voices read passages from On Light, or the Ingression of Forms, by Robert Grosseteste.", "poster_path": "/ovAeLJTYnYk4Uihg1OqT1SSEmLI.jpg", "release_date": "1970-04-01", "title": "Zorns Lemma", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.7, "vote_count": 13, "popularity": 1.784}, {"id": 43845, "video": false, "vote_count": 10, "vote_average": 7.4, "title": "La Marseillaise", "release_date": "1938-02-02", "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "La Marseillaise", "genre_ids": [18, 36], "backdrop_path": "/sqGmIcmJRgaptUxVQRV742Hl2lc.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A film about the early part of the French Revolution, shown from the eyes of the citizens of Marseille, counts in German exile and, of course, the king Louis XVI, each showing their own small problems.", "poster_path": "/5NgEWMe3RFESHgYtKsxsY2gLZA4.jpg", "popularity": 2.345}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/8uAVnt8nVhMc9Kyzj9XZhUKoxpn.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 44284, "original_language": "ar", "original_title": "\u0635\u0645\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0635\u0648\u0631", "overview": "The death of a prince brings a young woman back to the palace where she was born into servitude.
