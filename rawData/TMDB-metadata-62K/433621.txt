Five years after he fled with RMB 800,000 from a bank robbery, Liu Chuan returns incognito to the town. Policeman Wang Laoshi, who was on duty at the time of the robbery and was demoted for letting Liu escape, is working in the same district police station to which he was transferred after the robbery and still keeps an eye on Liu. By chance, Liu stays in some small lodgings in Wang's district where Qin Xiaosong, a psychology graduate who's run away from her domineering parents, is staying. Next day, Wang spots Liu in the street and gives chase, finally handcuffing him in a deserted warehouse. At that moment, the town is devastated by an earthquake and the building collapses. Wang is knocked unconscious and Liu steals his uniform. After rescuing Qin, Liu finds himself roped into saving other townspeople and becomes a hero in the locals' eyes. Meanwhile, Wang recovers and sets out to hunt down Liu.", "poster_path": "/gENpgCVu1JRbzocliOCljBkJRXr.jpg", "release_date": "2011-05-09", "title": "Fallen City", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 9, "popularity": 1.83}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/4X1N1Diiv1OsyvLuxAhzYmCTMCF.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 53, 9648, 10749, 80], "id": 417809, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Fatal Crossing", "overview": "When high-flying tech entrepreneur Carson Griffin believes himself guilty of killing a pedestrian while driving drunk, guilt and paranoia begin to unravel his life ahead of the launch of his new company as he plays a dangerous game of cat and mouse with June, the girlfriend of the deceased who is hell-bent on proving he is responsible.", "poster_path": "/nOuXSXTNX8x85wHky4Rphw4ry00.jpg", "release_date": "2017-11-19", "title": "Fatal Crossing", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 3, "popularity": 3.021}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/poVt3f1dCG3J6UnczY9Otml7WvT.jpg", "genre_ids": [878], "id": 543140, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Capture", "overview": "A group of scientists perform an unethical experiment bending both space and time \u2013in the process they may have not only changed their lives but also the very fabric of the universe.", "poster_path": "/iVpoC6Kzg96S63rc1RWmNuV7DP3.jpg", "release_date": "2017-11-16", "title": "The Capture", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.4, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 3.017}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/mMtfFZIwYocK2sMO8J1GizcbFtg.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 18], "id": 420452, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Circuit", "overview": "Newly arrived in town Nat and Gabe accept a dinner invitation from the volatile Hungarian Helene and her boorish husband Sasha.
