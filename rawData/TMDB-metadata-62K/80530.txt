Rowling Story is a made-for-TV film starring Australian actress Poppy Montgomery. The film, which was shot in B.C. Canada locations altered to look like British locations, details the journey of struggling single mother J. K. Rowling, her bid to become a published author, and her rise to fame that followed the publication of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. The film aired on Lifetime on July 18th and was criticized for being too lacklustre (mainly down to the fiercely private author having no say in the production) but it also shed some light on her personal life and featured scenes such as her highly abusive first husband and the death of her mother. The eponymous J.K. Rowling is the world's first billionaire (in terms of US dollars) author and the films inspired by her books have been the highest grossing films of all time.  Poppy Montgomery reportedly got blue contact lenses to play the role of the highly influential author.", "popularity": 6.632, "poster_path": "/q57TPuSvaPmhbzzb7yWyKcApNc6.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 8976, "logo_path": null, "name": "Media Max Productions", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 3431, "logo_path": "/6LVLYfZAEQfhJey0MGvhFXdDEK1.png", "name": "Lifetime", "origin_country": "US"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2011-07-18", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 87, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Magic Beyond Words: The JK Rowling Story", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.1, "vote_count": 119, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 5565, "name": "biography"}, {"id": 196751, "name": "fictional biography"}, {"id": 209223, "name": "multiple sclerosis"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 266856, "video": false, "vote_count": 6976, "vote_average": 7.9, "title": "The Theory of Everything", "release_date": "2014-11-26", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Theory of Everything", "genre_ids": [18, 10749], "backdrop_path": "/geAe08WmchATnZF461WffQBqJk1.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "The Theory of Everything is the extraordinary story of one of the world\u2019s greatest living minds, the renowned astrophysicist Stephen Hawking, who falls deeply in love with fellow Cambridge student Jane Wilde.", "poster_path": "/4jspr8hLLuju59bCnMiefzRW4p0.jpg", "popularity": 22.686}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/nU6DDTabbMkd3649WYtSiOdHCMC.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 10749], "id": 332283, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Mary Shelley", "overview": "The love affair between poet Percy Shelley and Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin resulted in the creation of an immortal novel, \u201cFrankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus.\u201d", "poster_path": "/gKHJTsrfxJtfFNPQJn2hDNEMtFf.jpg", "release_date": "2018-04-22", "title": "Mary Shelley", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.1, "vote_count": 516, "popularity": 11.335}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/jK3EAFk3GdOaQfUDCOiTujzMpwH.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 389015, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "I, Tonya", "overview": "Competitive ice skater Tonya Harding rises amongst the ranks at the U.
