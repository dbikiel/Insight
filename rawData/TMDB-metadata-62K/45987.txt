Olga (Audrey Campbell) is a woman who, working with \"the Syndicate\" (a criminal network that encompasses the local mafia and several Russian and Chinese communist operatives), oversees a stable of women who do double duty as prostitutes and drug pushers. Olga is a cruel woman who will tolerate no misbehavior among her charges (many of whom are addicted to \"the Big H\" and work for her to feed their habits), and subjects them to periodic torture sessions when she feels they aren't living up to her expectations. When Olga discovers that one of her girls has turned informant, she takes it upon herself to beat the truth out of the women until she finds out who has betrayed her, leading several embittered hookers and addicts to turn against their cruel mistress...though Olga ends up having the last word.", "poster_path": "/3WMFPO9dJ2m6JggAtQ5PYBERac9.jpg", "release_date": "1964-09-30", "title": "Olga's Girls", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.2, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 2.267}, {"id": 109379, "video": false, "vote_count": 8, "vote_average": 7.1, "title": "The Peach Thief", "release_date": "1964-11-09", "original_language": "bg", "original_title": "\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0446\u044a\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438", "genre_ids": [18, 10749, 10752], "backdrop_path": "/oQOZeqboftSkNi5wU483UgPeoEN.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "The wife of a Bulgarian POW camp's warden falls in love with a Serbian prisoner at the end of World War I.", "poster_path": "/maySiiLihlnl622Bu4mBlZ42oa0.jpg", "popularity": 2.591}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99], "id": 344429, "original_language": "es", "original_title": "Los invencibles Shuaras del alto Amazonas", "overview": "Scenes of daily life in the Indian communities of Ecuador.", "poster_path": "/bkBjvRn3qJm1Glh790LxEZe6hMc.jpg", "release_date": "1926-06-11", "title": "The Invincible Shuar People of the Upper Amazon", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 3, "popularity": 0.6}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 341113, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "I Am Twenty", "overview": "Those born on Independence Day in 1947 were selected from different parts of India and interviewed to know their hopes and desires,ambitions, hobbies, fears and frustrations and the result is this unique film.", "poster_path": "/2sRHDxuqzbHShEqQCTL9MCesoe7.jpg", "release_date": "1967-04-01", "title": "I Am Twenty", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.7, "vote_count": 3, "popularity": 0.6}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [18], "id": 167494, "original_language": "bn", "original_title": "\u09af\u09c1\u0995\u09cd\u09a4\u09bf-\u09a4\u0995\u09cd\u0995\u09cb \u0986\u09b0 \u0997\u09aa\u09cd\u09aa\u09cb", "overview": "Four men, each peculiar in his own way, embark on a quest to reason with the estranged wife of the protagonist.", "poster_path": "/2jV9sVBtvbk9v8o50wVzgE5jEA0.jpg", "release_date": "1974-01-01", "title": "Reason, Debate and a Story", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.6, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 1.94}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 154907, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Sunday", "overview": "", "poster_path": "/uR0s8pXMKnuq5Vvy4U0Ec0paev2.jpg", "release_date": "1961-12-31", "title": "Sunday", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.8, "vote_count": 4, "popularity": 1.4}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/rPN8J7Ws5TOD6LmiRdrPwxOYqAg.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 80], "id": 103396, "original_language": "de", "original_title": "Nachts, wenn der Teufel kam", "overview": "A serial killer terrorizes Hamburg, Germany, during World War II.
