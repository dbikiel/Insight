In a country with a low crime rate, the nation watched with horror as Quick's confessions mounted, accounting for many of the country's unsolved murders. With testimonials from a range of people whose lives have been dominated by this story - including Quick himself - and dramatic reenactment, Brian Hill weaves a stylish noir thriller that works a treat on the big screen. What appears at first to be a tale of unimaginable evil evolves into something much more layered as Hill digs deep into the motivations behind those working closely with Quick.", "poster_path": "/41d2miYUuPQM8E78l7rsLlhXJJu.jpg", "release_date": "2015-08-14", "title": "The Confessions of Thomas Quick", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 12, "popularity": 3.373}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/qiGmQNr8Nnj0eFdXBuMyXPUMmXd.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 53], "id": 207766, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Missionary", "overview": "A wife and mother starts an affair with a young missionary... with disastrous consequences.", "poster_path": "/s5nNj0VrFn0G2IeezISrBsbLhqv.jpg", "release_date": "2013-07-25", "title": "Missionary", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.3, "vote_count": 13, "popularity": 3.158}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 10}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "Laurie Braga", "credit_id": "52fe4a19c3a36847f81b96f5", "gender": 1, "id": 20362, "name": "Jill Clayburgh", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/kTy4CVnQhcRBqe6ZyLKtqW92sfh.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "Joseph Braga", "credit_id": "52fe4a19c3a36847f81b96f9", "gender": 2, "id": 69010, "name": "Brad Davis", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/qI5L5vzoZszHfs4GGiXzx2J0vzX.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "Herschell", "credit_id": "52fe4a19c3a36847f81b96fd", "gender": 2, "id": 172496, "name": "Sam Behrens", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/oQQ5ECEyymYZkIinQYhrIBDsoWF.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Neil Harrison", "credit_id": "52fe4a19c3a36847f81b9701", "gender": 2, "id": 160274, "name": "Gary Frank", "order": 3, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Jeff Samek", "credit_id": "52fe4a19c3a36847f81b9705", "gender": 2, "id": 51551, "name": "James Handy", "order": 4, "profile_path": "/vm0WQmuP8jEGgFTd3VCcJe7zpUi.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 6, "character": "Richard Maxwell", "credit_id": "52fe4a19c3a36847f81b9709", "gender": 2, "id": 88949, "name": "Mark Harelik", "order": 5, "profile_path": "/yn7Pw7t5YOEimhXsUtdM3vmvuWG.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 7, "character": "Jackie Harrison", "credit_id": "52fe4a19c3a36847f81b970d", "gender": 1, "id": 47456, "name": "Season Hubley", "order": 6, "profile_path": "/2ybkW5872ZZPTqrt6LABUwoPdXT.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 8, "character": "Dan Casey", "credit_id": "52fe4a19c3a36847f81b9711", "gender": 2, "id": 102714, "name": "Terence Knox", "order": 7, "profile_path": "/oZKbqJM5myBQabHvhXCsttjjXyt.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4a19c3a36847f81b9723", "department": "Writing", "gender": 2, "id": 106723, "job": "Teleplay", "name": "Alan Landsburg", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe4a19c3a36847f81b972f", "department": "Sound", "gender": 0, "id": 935631, "job": "Original Music Composer", "name": "Mike Post", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "535d8616c3a36830a0004482", "department": "Camera", "gender": 0, "id": 1044108, "job": "Director of Photography", "name": "Steven Shaw", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe4a19c3a36847f81b9717", "department": "Directing", "gender": 1, "id": 1114555, "job": "Director", "name": "Linda Otto", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe4a19c3a36847f81b971d", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 1187537, "job": "Story", "name": "Jan Hollingsworth", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe4a19c3a36847f81b9729", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 1187538, "job": "Teleplay", "name": "Hesper Anderson", "profile_path": null}]}}
