Their ability to live with their aberrations while remaining socially involved and upbeat is truly inspirational. While their predecessors were often seen in so called \"freak shows\" that were part of various exhibitions from Coney Island to traveling circuses, these performers were actually the more fortunate ones in an era of little tolerance for those who were different from the accepted norm. Many became famous and extremely wealthy, such as Tom Thumb (Charles Sherwood Stratton), who worked for many years with P.T. Barnum.", "popularity": 1.176, "poster_path": "/eMM1FVFjqhl6lmmzC2OiX8ev0x8.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1987-01-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 40, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "Six Shocking Stories You'll Never Forget", "title": "I Am Not a Freak", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "Self", "credit_id": "586dfbef9251412956004004", "gender": 0, "id": 1307987, "name": "Mickey Hays", "order": 1, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "Self", "credit_id": "586dfbfbc3a3683b6d0044ca", "gender": 0, "id": 1710769, "name": "Peter Risch", "order": 2, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "Self", "credit_id": "586dfc03c3a3683b85003d5d", "gender": 2, "id": 4965, "name": "Jack Elam", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/nsPOk2xOj33fpsBj60mcxGcjyBW.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "586dfb8e925141295f003f3b", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 112588, "job": "Director", "name": "Kirby Dick", "profile_path": "/89dwzpAQaQE2xRfXmUNQr7xuGg1.jpg"}]}}
