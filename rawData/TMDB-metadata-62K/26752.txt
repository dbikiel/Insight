He manages a nearly abandoned movie theater, and makes just about nothing doing it. When his wife announces she's pregnant, he nearly goes frantic trying to find money to get her an abortion. However, what truly sends him over the edge is when his mistress decides to become a prostitute because, after all, the money is good. These two situations send him straight to the loony bin, and when he gets out, he discovers that his wife has rented their apartment to pornographic filmmakers, and guess who's starring in them?", "poster_path": "/9h2xly07XJ8J29boY6eF4jIdadB.jpg", "release_date": "1993-05-12", "title": "The Conjugal Bed", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.7, "vote_count": 3, "popularity": 0.942}, {"id": 390017, "video": false, "vote_count": 3, "vote_average": 8.0, "title": "A Girl's Tears", "release_date": "1980-03-26", "original_language": "ro", "original_title": "O lacrim\u0103 de fat\u0103", "genre_ids": [18], "backdrop_path": null, "adult": false, "overview": "A cinema-verite approach to this mystery story about the death of a young girl in a village adds credence to the story itself, it is as though the audience were following along with a real investigation instead of simply watching a narrative unfold.
