Continuing his exploration of curious and extraordinary environments, Slow Action applies the idea of island biogeography - the study of how species and eco-systems evolve differently when isolated and surrounded by unsuitable habitat - to a conception of the Earth in a few hundred years; the sea level rising to absurd heights, creating hyperbolic utopias that appear as possible future mini-societies.  This series of constructed realities explores the environments of self-contained lands and the search for information to enable the reconstruction of soon to be lost worlds.", "popularity": 1.11, "poster_path": "/aiij8IIZ3VABoo3MBiBx8eOQYOE.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "2010-01-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 46, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Slow Action", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.8, "vote_count": 6, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99], "id": 195630, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Kobelkoff", "overview": "A one minute short in which limbless Nikolai Kobelkoff demonstrates a series of seemingly mundane tasks.", "poster_path": "/xhZKSlSSNknHkotUNpOvP572sBH.jpg", "release_date": "1900-05-21", "title": "Kobelkoff", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 6, "popularity": 0.8}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [18], "id": 143453, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Thrust in Me", "overview": "Zedd plays dual roles in this short-film as a street-wandering guy and a suicidal female.", "poster_path": "/opxTwwNxZPDyt1c2RzfMvXpvumz.jpg", "release_date": "1985-09-11", "title": "Thrust in Me", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.3, "vote_count": 3, "popularity": 1.028}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [27, 12, 14, 35], "id": 183107, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Tom Thumb in the Land of the Giants", "overview": "A bizarre adventure in which a young boy is chased by a masked phantom holding a severed arm in a graveyard.
