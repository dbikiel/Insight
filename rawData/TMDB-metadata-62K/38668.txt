Based on interviews with former and active prostitutes the realities of male prostitutes in Berlin are treated. The film is value-free, objective, and records the hustler scene as a social Submilieu, which is characterized by both tragic fates, as well as everyday things and routines. Not only the direct sale of sexual services is discussed, but also other aspects associated with male prostitution: poverty, drug addiction, AIDS, crime, migration, love and partnership.", "poster_path": "/xzylnDrEm9EWxcHYIbjRFt7AV70.jpg", "popularity": 1.534}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 9}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 18, "character": "Narrator", "credit_id": "5409d53e0e0a262b3700008b", "gender": 0, "id": 1360928, "name": "Harry Giese", "order": 1, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 19, "character": "Herself (archive footage)", "credit_id": "5409d54d0e0a262b430000aa", "gender": 1, "id": 121319, "name": "Mona Maris", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/jS8yLzHwpk1oTVpAxyKoieQ69KY.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 20, "character": "Himself (archive footage)", "credit_id": "56c1257992514108d30010b7", "gender": 2, "id": 2313, "name": "Curt Bois", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/tTYAnUtdmdn1KXS8rod1BNVGAX4.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 23, "character": "(archive footage)", "credit_id": "56c12608c3a36817ef00d7c3", "gender": 2, "id": 13905, "name": "Fritz Kortner", "order": 6, "profile_path": "/liJxiacsNiEsPfnitAhZkameRhj.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 24, "character": "(archive footage)", "credit_id": "56c1261ec3a36817f200d796", "gender": 2, "id": 2094, "name": "Peter Lorre", "order": 7, "profile_path": "/3SkaTzf4UmySW8ZIDdFL9F4y5C8.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 25, "character": "Himself (archive footage)", "credit_id": "56c12633c3a36817f200d79c", "gender": 2, "id": 2428, "name": "Ernst Lubitsch", "order": 8, "profile_path": "/fJeGenaTarQTLl21eDlnx4MIM9K.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 26, "character": "Herself (archive footage)", "credit_id": "56c1264d92514108d30010d9", "gender": 1, "id": 1577677, "name": "Rosa Luxemburg", "order": 9, "profile_path": "/72fThswY96HY4lzOgtynPyb72dD.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 27, "character": "(archive footage)", "credit_id": "56c1266ac3a36817e4005a03", "gender": 2, "id": 2897, "name": "Kurt Gerron", "order": 10, "profile_path": "/1dannHvwMGKxqITWP6VNoR3nwIC.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 28, "character": "(archive footage)", "credit_id": "56c12682c3a36817ef00d7de", "gender": 0, "id": 1577678, "name": "Emil Ludwig", "order": 11, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 29, "character": "(archive footage)", "credit_id": "56c12699c3a36817e4005a0d", "gender": 2, "id": 29132, "name": "Richard Oswald", "order": 12, "profile_path": "/xLAvBEMfRpQnWT2ThvxpdxK21KS.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 30, "character": "(archive footage)", "credit_id": "56c126b2c3a368180a00e573", "gender": 2, "id": 232629, "name": "Max Reinhardt", "order": 13, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 31, "character": "(archive footage)", "credit_id": "56c126d092514109be000f2e", "gender": 2, "id": 1197059, "name": "Richard Tauber", "order": 14, "profile_path": "/1Uhs3AsaTpB4pYv0jhDnN6UeC6o.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 32, "character": "(archive footage)", "credit_id": "56c126e9c3a36817f200d7bb", "gender": 1, "id": 2898, "name": "Rosa Valetti", "order": 15, "profile_path": "/6FkyTtJRJJIkHQbU5G6HLnqOtms.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 33, "character": "(archive footage)", "credit_id": "56c12735c3a36817e4005a2f", "gender": 2, "id": 124309, "name": "George Arliss", "order": 16, "profile_path": "/qx7ZeGwTbmRqgMBNrea9wH0u7oh.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 34, "character": "(archive footage)", "credit_id": "56c12756c3a36817ef00d80e", "gender": 2, "id": 1322976, "name": "Max Pohl", "order": 17, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 35, "character": "(archive footage)", "credit_id": "56c1278192514109be000f56", "gender": 1, "id": 108719, "name": "Anna Sten", "order": 18, "profile_path": "/bjnUxzEsWdLPSiB7jQJVtkyobpD.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 36, "character": "Himself (archive footage)", "credit_id": "56c127a492514167b20006fa", "gender": 2, "id": 13848, "name": "Charlie Chaplin", "order": 19, "profile_path": "/oEcTfMUIGSaAq2fN8O2nCMzcPhj.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "5409d37ec3a36879b2000056", "department": "Sound", "gender": 0, "id": 47299, "job": "Music", "name": "Franz R.
