His journey begins by flying to the city where he was born. Upon his arrival, Nathan checks into a hotel and meets Mave the hotel's housekeeper. Encouraged by Mave's wisdom and the help of hotel guest Shelly, Nathan finds the address of his mother, Linda. Linda is a social worker who agonizes over the decision she made with Nathan 20 years ago. In an effort to admonish the guilt of giving up her son, Linda is caught up in the life of a teenage mother-to-be, Tori, who is conflicted by the decision to abort her baby. When Nathan gathers the courage to meet his mother, he uncovers a terrible secret that totally redefines what was meant to be for his life.", "popularity": 1.952, "poster_path": "/if7hc1uZDS0Bpv2NOxwskaeRWAi.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 72197, "logo_path": null, "name": "White Door Media", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 6427, "logo_path": "/73gMvgccXNJLd5E6VKJzuHT1Ik0.png", "name": "Pure Flix Entertainment", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2012-12-27", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 88, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "Let There Be Life", "title": "Meant to Be", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 4, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 456, "name": "mother"}, {"id": 6150, "name": "faith"}, {"id": 6711, "name": "crisis"}, {"id": 9649, "name": "god"}, {"id": 11112, "name": "search"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/g8G91vbvyUqnyFSlVruwiaZsUrn.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 458737, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "First Reformed", "overview": "A pastor of a small church in upstate New York starts to spiral out of control after a soul-shaking encounter with an unstable environmental activist and his pregnant wife.", "poster_path": "/p2UylV0hPefEuWPFMo1r56vu2nb.jpg", "release_date": "2018-05-18", "title": "First Reformed", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 577, "popularity": 11.445}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/1RTiQXeHoEMXkZNWaB8W5uaEZ2.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 205220, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Philomena", "overview": "A woman searches for her adult son, who was taken away from her decades ago when she was forced to live in a convent.", "poster_path": "/6BTXHupSPkrwsoz4Br6qwwSVmhj.jpg", "release_date": "2013-11-01", "title": "Philomena", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.4, "vote_count": 1043, "popularity": 12.553}, {"id": 310, "video": false, "vote_count": 6935, "vote_average": 6.6, "title": "Bruce Almighty", "release_date": "2003-05-23", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Bruce Almighty", "genre_ids": [35, 14], "backdrop_path": "/bhEudqWbWsiEBdnl0kCIwFp5Hay.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Bruce Nolan toils as a 'human interest' television reporter in Buffalo, N.Y., but despite his high ratings and the love of his beautiful girlfriend, Bruce remains unfulfilled.
