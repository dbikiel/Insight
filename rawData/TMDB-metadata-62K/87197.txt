Using spliced-together strips of colored film leader in white, yellow, blue, red, green, etc., Lawder ran the film through a projector and found the results to be quite boring. While he was running the film, though, he noticed how beautiful the colored strips of film looked as they ran through the projector. So, he turned a camera on the projector and filmed the colored film gorgeously winding its way through the projector's machinery.\" - Noel Black, Colorado Springs Independent", "poster_path": "/jQCMXLYezcKSdDFk74hhzKypomb.jpg", "release_date": "1971-12-31", "title": "Color Film", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 11, "popularity": 1.742}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99], "id": 127806, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Case Study: Barbiturates", "overview": "A man talks about addiction to barbiturates.", "poster_path": "/d4Ia5taBXbWNKgRYWLUGCb7OAb5.jpg", "release_date": "1969-12-31", "title": "Case Study: Barbiturates", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.2, "vote_count": 10, "popularity": 1.488}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [18], "id": 130838, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Valse Triste", "overview": "With a similar dreamy mood like its predecessor \"Take the 5:10 to Dreamland\" (1976) this clip starts with a boy getting into his bed. The camera zooms in into the boy's mind and a slow, sad waltz (i.e.\"Valse Triste\") accompanies images of a locomotive, a miner, the globe, the sky, a sheep heard, etc. Disparate elements, but if one concentrates only at the movement of the figures, one can perceive a commotion, slowly livening up: The starting wheels of the heavy locomotive, the tired miner pushing the heavy cart of coal bricks, the globe smoothly turning around and around, the clouds imperceptibly floating in the sky, the sheep idly moving in the herd, etc.  We reach the first climax when a mannequin opens her coat like a flower. The second big crescendo spurts out from a \"water hose\", after watching schoolgirls doing gymnastics for quite a while. A sad, but nostalgic aftertaste lingers in the end when funeral cars drive away through a flooded area\u2026", "poster_path": "/fsLJMk1dPfzr5qXd3IRSmZRxpX6.jpg", "release_date": "1977-06-01", "title": "Valse Triste", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 9, "popularity": 2.37}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 163085, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Jam Session", "overview": "Duke Ellington and Orchestra perform 'C Jam Blues'.", "poster_path": "/j2Y7rsDvh1mYwDpVLcCco9dQA8v.jpg", "release_date": "1942-01-01", "title": "Jam Session", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 10, "popularity": 0.993}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/dFO8Tntl7JfiB4fYGTmEa3tYqL.jpg", "genre_ids": [16, 35], "id": 86735, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Magical Maestro", "overview": "After he is rejected by the Great Poochini as an opening act, Mysto the Magician gets his revenge by conducting his next operatic performance.", "poster_path": "/f4MAs2wrANQFc2SFKlSIJ9yniN9.jpg", "release_date": "1952-02-09", "title": "Magical Maestro", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.4, "vote_count": 23, "popularity": 2.388}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99, 10402], "id": 147018, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Marian Anderson: The Lincoln Memorial Concert", "overview": "Short film which documents Marian Anderson's singing performance at the Lincoln Memorial.", "poster_path": "/A152t27IHaWbF5t2OxXzb8BfAs8.jpg", "release_date": "1939-12-31", "title": "Marian Anderson: The Lincoln Memorial Concert", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.8, "vote_count": 9, "popularity": 1.55}], "total_pages": 2, "total_results": 40}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 3, "character": "The Hipster / Noah Webster (voice) (uncredited)", "credit_id": "56aa2742c3a36872cd00700a", "gender": 2, "id": 12503, "name": "John Brown", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/43pQuw9s3jRsNesIwRmEf3siFZP.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe49b99251416c910b6a9f", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 237588, "job": "Director", "name": "Tex Avery", "profile_path": "/gphoZwmUsxA7l8wKfmw5xdU20RQ.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "56aa26cc9251417db90063ef", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 1061415, "job": "Story", "name": "Rich Hogan", "profile_path": null}]}}
