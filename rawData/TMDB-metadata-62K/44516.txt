Where Herminda is blithely frank about her job, Luisa is not as casual. On a trip home to bring her mother and little brother to the city (to help care for Herminda's baby), Luisa is viciously gang-raped by her former boyfriend and his cohorts -- but she endures. She eventually gets a job in a massage parlor but is fired when she nixes a client -- and she still endures, back on the streets again. Her sister scorns her, her new boyfriend dumps her, a dear friend is murdered -- yet Luisa never gives in to despair.
