And then the unexpected happens. A bomb explodes in the center of the shopping mall where he works. He drags himself towards the entrance to save the victims. One by one he pulls them out, until something terrible takes place. In complete hysteria he runs off till he falls down from exhaustion. A woman's voice makes him raise his head. She's one of the victims he saved. She wants to know why the suicide bomber did it. This encounter projects him back in history and even in a surreal world. Thereafter he runs into everyone he saved and feels that their defeat shows many parallels with his own. Even his confrontation with the wrongdoer isn't that straightforward as he thought it would be and confronts him with the fact that guilt and innocence can be pretty much alike.", "popularity": 2.818, "poster_path": "/wY0GyzZJnwVopPylVDRsogz5k5F.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 8106, "logo_path": null, "name": "IJswater Films BV", "origin_country": "NL"}, {"id": 8107, "logo_path": null, "name": "Revolver Films", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 8108, "logo_path": null, "name": "Ryva", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "BE", "name": "Belgium"}], "release_date": "2010-11-17", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 92, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "nl", "name": "Nederlands"}, {"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}, {"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "How your life can change in the blink of an eye.", "title": "22nd of May", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 8, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/spHyXOVrGOcKcLNI7oWL09rUQu7.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 85752, "original_language": "nl", "original_title": "Dorp aan de rivier", "overview": "An independent-thinking doctor in a rural community with his own ideas of how medicine should be practiced begins to find himself ostracized from the community after one of his patients commits suicide.", "poster_path": "/o3RsejQIc9HBN7ljomxh4pkip49.jpg", "release_date": "1958-08-19", "title": "Village by the River", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.8, "vote_count": 4, "popularity": 0.84}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 1}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "Sam", "credit_id": "52fe4991c3a368484e132237", "gender": 2, "id": 76285, "name": "Sam Louwyck", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/hO4CrNxyjPm0v9sAqOXRWjvcfZt.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "Nico Degeest", "credit_id": "52fe4991c3a368484e13223b", "gender": 0, "id": 51489, "name": "Titus De Voogdt", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/rHhK9nPLuEFH2PHQE6wNoFFlsEe.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "Jan", "credit_id": "52fe4991c3a368484e13223f", "gender": 2, "id": 76294, "name": "Jan Hammenecker", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/jQ7YIEzp5JBHjks6PYMPcZba2e3.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Salesman", "credit_id": "52fe4991c3a368484e132243", "gender": 2, "id": 76286, "name": "Fran\u00e7ois Beukelaers", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/dPjQNCKLbC0Fx3RyPzmG2zigYrh.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Norman", "credit_id": "52fe4991c3a368484e132247", "gender": 2, "id": 76283, "name": "Norman Baert", "order": 4, "profile_path": "/cz6Sy3eRcHaxjo3AHxKfoXlGEAu.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 6, "character": "Wim", "credit_id": "52fe4991c3a368484e13224b", "gender": 2, "id": 76292, "name": "Wim Willaert", "order": 5, "profile_path": "/wVtjuEuDu07fCWTgVSqYaUgG7Lm.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 7, "character": "Gunter", "credit_id": "52fe4991c3a368484e13224f", "gender": 0, "id": 76284, "name": "Gunter Lamoot", "order": 6, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 8, "character": "Sandra Lauwaert", "credit_id": "52fe4991c3a368484e132253", "gender": 0, "id": 76293, "name": "Barbara Callewaert", "order": 7, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 9, "character": "Steffi", "credit_id": "52fe4991c3a368484e132257", "gender": 0, "id": 583313, "name": "Steffi Peeters", "order": 8, "profile_path": null}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4991c3a368484e13225d", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 76249, "job": "Director", "name": "Koen Mortier", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5c63faea0e0a262fa195cb3b", "department": "Writing", "gender": 2, "id": 76249, "job": "Writer", "name": "Koen Mortier", "profile_path": null}]}}
