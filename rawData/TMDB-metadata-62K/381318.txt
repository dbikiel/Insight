Also, it takes some time until the pieces fall into place and the beginning, despite being \"spiced\" with eerie dream sequences, is rather boring. In conclusion, this is a very decent movie and, particularly, a beautifully shot one. For those who like handsome movies, it is a must. The fact it was made before the fall of the Communist regime doesn't necessarily means it's aesthetically subdued.
