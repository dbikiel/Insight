The final symbolic images of Spring, achieved through time-lapse photography, are almost unbearably beautiful. The winner of several festival awards, Farrebique nonetheless did not immediately result in an outpouring of financing for Rouqier's follow-up films (this was a common problem in the financially strapped French film industry of the 1940s). Perhaps as a result, Rouqier did not make his sequel, Biquefarre (filmed in the same region, with some of the same \"actors\"), until 1983.", "poster_path": "/rx81Dh44AxQnTtDJqrlFPptvJk5.jpg", "release_date": "1946-09-01", "title": "Farrebique, or the Four Seasons", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 1.586}], "total_pages": 2, "total_results": 40}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "Drina", "credit_id": "52fe4570c3a368484e05b0cb", "gender": 1, "id": 528, "name": "Sylvia Sidney", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/mnTIQavldzHDgPFOmL4BSDFkM8q.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "Dave", "credit_id": "52fe4570c3a368484e05b0cf", "gender": 2, "id": 20501, "name": "Joel McCrea", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/v2CgGPUo0BMs8Iiz2T4hU09glwf.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "'Baby Face' Martin", "credit_id": "52fe4570c3a368484e05b0d3", "gender": 2, "id": 4110, "name": "Humphrey Bogart", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/pxJrZluJHhbWRo2QXAG99FvXUi7.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Kay", "credit_id": "52fe4570c3a368484e05b0d7", "gender": 1, "id": 106089, "name": "Wendy Barrie", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/en6bkoYvA2koBGezpO5qr9fSIRW.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Francey", "credit_id": "52fe4570c3a368484e05b0db", "gender": 1, "id": 14965, "name": "Claire Trevor", "order": 4, "profile_path": "/6RMb6vmgxfTpSWF7fggD0kYnP19.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 6, "character": "Hunk", "credit_id": "52fe4570c3a368484e05b0df", "gender": 2, "id": 30005, "name": "Allen Jenkins", "order": 5, "profile_path": "/t2ZumhV1ztWifv0uJHLfSztdUsM.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 7, "character": "Mrs. Martin", "credit_id": "52fe4570c3a368484e05b0e3", "gender": 1, "id": 13996, "name": "Marjorie Main", "order": 6, "profile_path": "/dB0fpVSeUbKMbyGHU1q1MmICT1N.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 8, "character": "Tommy", "credit_id": "52fe4570c3a368484e05b0e7", "gender": 2, "id": 95296, "name": "Billy Halop", "order": 7, "profile_path": "/xKlK8MJkQ4q7J4B37eo4eB0TDaW.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 9, "character": "Dippy", "credit_id": "52fe4570c3a368484e05b0eb", "gender": 2, "id": 33024, "name": "Huntz Hall", "order": 8, "profile_path": "/wR3Rlmbwu5gfISwljC1Z0VRSvp4.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 10, "character": "Angel", "credit_id": "52fe4570c3a368484e05b0ef", "gender": 2, "id": 89990, "name": "Bobby Jordan", "order": 9, "profile_path": "/aGUcaw202mfEAEb6il9qkdkhNdv.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 11, "character": "Spit", "credit_id": "52fe4570c3a368484e05b0f3", "gender": 2, "id": 89989, "name": "Leo Gorcey", "order": 10, "profile_path": "/ntzfWLKlvtMuem9knh5Omx6mkcP.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 12, "character": "T.B.", "credit_id": "52fe4570c3a368484e05b0f7", "gender": 2, "id": 89750, "name": "Gabriel Dell", "order": 11, "profile_path": "/bnVOoJxxzrgFxHsT1qhpwFUTbMF.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 13, "character": "Milty", "credit_id": "52fe4570c3a368484e05b0fb", "gender": 0, "id": 95298, "name": "Bernard Punsly", "order": 12, "profile_path": "/hEQtUTZx1eFbh0rsj0wC49y6oP2.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 14, "character": "Philip", "credit_id": "52fe4570c3a368484e05b0ff", "gender": 0, "id": 106090, "name": "Charles Peck", "order": 13, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 15, "character": "Mr. Griswald", "credit_id": "52fe4570c3a368484e05b103", "gender": 2, "id": 30279, "name": "Minor Watson", "order": 14, "profile_path": "/1t0VRIa8oykSFS3WXcMfCCOCakH.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 16, "character": "Police Officer Mulligan", "credit_id": "52fe4570c3a368484e05b107", "gender": 2, "id": 14453, "name": "James Burke", "order": 15, "profile_path": "/s01DJdyVjmF0f6fXIGzsDHjPVGs.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 17, "character": "Doorman", "credit_id": "52fe4570c3a368484e05b10b", "gender": 2, "id": 4303, "name": "Ward Bond", "order": 16, "profile_path": "/5HbDXDgFcpA07HjPpGpYRzGXnfN.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 18, "character": "Mrs. Connell", "credit_id": "52fe4570c3a368484e05b10f", "gender": 1, "id": 99329, "name": "Elisabeth Risdon", "order": 17, "profile_path": "/lWDXhI6GCbMF3AIWyTmCGBeOwpD.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 19, "character": "Mrs. Fenner", "credit_id": "52fe4570c3a368484e05b113", "gender": 1, "id": 34268, "name": "Esther Dale", "order": 18, "profile_path": "/dnnaoECyLuK5havb4YHKunJu7ZT.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 20, "character": "Pascagli", "credit_id": "52fe4570c3a368484e05b117", "gender": 2, "id": 106091, "name": "George Humbert", "order": 19, "profile_path": "/cVo8bxLicAiRuTdOurnnfW6TwAp.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 21, "character": "Governess", "credit_id": "52fe4570c3a368484e05b11b", "gender": 1, "id": 106092, "name": "Marcelle Corday", "order": 20, "profile_path": "/hStYcWHduKuc9bJbAcDsjMk5jBo.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 25, "character": "Dr. Flynn -
