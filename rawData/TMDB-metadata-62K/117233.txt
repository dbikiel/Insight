By order of the Prime Minister, black police officer John Othello (Eamonn Walker) is promoted to Commissioner, a post dearly coveted by Othello's friend, mentor and fellow officer Ben Jago (Christopher Eccleston). Seething with jealousy, Jago contrives to discredit Othello in the eyes of the public, and to destroy John's interracial marriage to the lily-white Dessie (Keeley Hawes). Among those used as unwitting dupes to gain Jago's ends are Othello's trusted lieutenant, Michael Cass (Richard Coyle), scrupulously honest police constable Alan Roderick (Del Synnott), and Jago's own wife, Lulu (Rachael Stirling).", "poster_path": "/ibIOygawh6JuNvI0OwmrsyKJ6k8.jpg", "release_date": "2001-12-23", "title": "Othello", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 2.358}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/uT7l6jPvPsLWC2TkywYKkM9C1RK.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 126004, "original_language": "xx", "original_title": "Five Dedicated to Ozu", "overview": "Finding himself in a house in the north of Iran by the Caspian Sea, the director picked up his handheld DV camera and began filming the seemingly anodyne events happening on the 500 metres of beach in front of his house\u2014a piece of wood toyed with by the waves, people walking by the sea, indistinct shapes on a wintry beach or noisy ducks.", "poster_path": "/9biMsL7VmiJoZbYf2ffrspiinaR.jpg", "release_date": "2003-12-10", "title": "Five Dedicated to Ozu", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 7, "popularity": 1.003}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/lfIo6ZS4rsKX7KgZU28ipEeY7u7.jpg", "genre_ids": [10402, 18, 14], "id": 85904, "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "La cicatrice int\u00e9rieure", "overview": "A collage of dreams.

This title was an obsession for him, every shot had to be an expression of 'the scar inside'. Apart from Garrel himself and actor Pierre Clementi, Garrel's former partner Nico, member of the legendary Velvet Underground, played a role in the film. Another important role was for the landscape. Garrel, 23 when he made the film, was compared with Jean Vigo because of his age and talent. La cicatrice int\u00e9rieure even led Claude Mauriac to call him the Rimbaud of film.
