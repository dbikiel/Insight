After a little kissing in the car, the couple realizes that the car is actually owned by Captain Gato and his caifanes. This encounter starts a tour around Mexico City, encouraged by the fascination shown by Paloma and for the manners, the way of speech and the treatment of the lower classes as well as the spontaneous friendship (always under suspect) that Los Caifanes provides them. The rest of the film is a portrait of the night life in the mexican capital city in the tumultuous and psychedelic sixties.
