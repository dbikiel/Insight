Upon their arrival, she begins to explore her new habitat, meeting local children and learning their routines and customs. However, it's not long before several bizarre occurrences crop up around the previously tranquil island. Orchards are found ransacked, prized trinkets start disappearing and, worst of all, each morning after her mother leaves for work, Momo hears strange mumblings coming from the attic of their home. Annoyed by these creepy goings-on and her mother's refusal to believe them, Momo embarks on a strange and supernatural adventure to discover the source of the mischief, which leads her to a trio of troublesome imps: the flatulent lizard Kawa, the childlike Mame and their hulking ogre leader Iwa. Momo also learns that her visit to the island is in some way connected to her father's mysterious letter.", "popularity": 8.641, "poster_path": "/w1bkQrf6fXytXwAlv8ph0v9FnRD.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 1393, "logo_path": "/frMsfc7igYUd90lQXpxuasiN5x4.png", "name": "TBS", "origin_country": "JP"}, {"id": 2073, "logo_path": "/bkpWpkSDfNG1HxJnjruVKHXBi7J.png", "name": "Kadokawa Pictures", "origin_country": "JP"}, {"id": 529, "logo_path": "/rwB6w2aPENQbx756pBWSw44Ouk.png", "name": "Production I.G", "origin_country": "JP"}, {"id": 1194, "logo_path": null, "name": "Kadokawa Shoten Publishing", "origin_country": "JP"}, {"id": 528, "logo_path": "/fO3Aof3lXQclYpBByYC8aneTXwA.png", "name": "Bandai Visual", "origin_country": "JP"}, {"id": 12384, "logo_path": "/qNooLje0YQh1y3y9LUM2Y5QCtiF.png", "name": "CBC", "origin_country": "JP"}, {"id": 8156, "logo_path": null, "name": "Chugoku Broadcasting (RCC)", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 4330, "logo_path": null, "name": "Horipro", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 76469, "logo_path": null, "name": "JR Kikaku", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 3363, "logo_path": null, "name": "Mainichi Broadcasting System (MBS)", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 5372, "logo_path": "/tPtJc2rCOTHEzJQPStT6m3dI0eK.png", "name": "OLM", "origin_country": "JP"}, {"id": 123663, "logo_path": null, "name": "Tokyu Recreation", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 7542, "logo_path": null, "name": "Yahoo Japan", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "JP", "name": "Japan"}], "release_date": "2012-04-21", "revenue": 6748712, "runtime": 120, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ja", "name": "\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "A Letter to Momo", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.6, "vote_count": 194, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 970, "name": "parent child relationship"}, {"id": 6152, "name": "supernatural"}, {"id": 10235, "name": "family relationships"}, {"id": 13139, "name": "animism"}, {"id": 68646, "name": "supernatural creature"}, {"id": 196509, "name": "youkai"}, {"id": 196510, "name": "mononoke"}, {"id": 210024, "name": "anime"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 8204, "video": false, "vote_count": 1536, "vote_average": 6.5, "title": "The Spiderwick Chronicles", "release_date": "2008-02-14", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Spiderwick Chronicles", "genre_ids": [12, 18, 14, 10751], "backdrop_path": "/2Uwv3eUDRJ9UcjN8AlSg4GDm6TN.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Upon moving into the run-down Spiderwick Estate with their mother, twin brothers Jared and Simon Grace, along with their sister Mallory, find themselves pulled into an alternate world full of faeries and other creatures.", "poster_path": "/nSLjsBDzwsIpQL534CNfAKidyAm.jpg", "popularity": 19.108}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/avhG8fITuG78IkKPk28CcBBHPOp.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 18], "id": 112160, "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "Chroniques sexuelles d'une famille d'aujourd'hui", "overview": "Three generations of a French family open up about their sexual experiences and desires after young Romain is caught masturbating in his biology class.", "poster_path": "/pU2nD3Llaz3Taq5FAaQUg00uJYD.jpg", "release_date": "2012-05-09", "title": "Sexual Chronicles of a French Family", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.4, "vote_count": 169, "popularity": 29.133}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/AqocxdL9luA7ALU0gGSHDzDy254.jpg", "genre_ids": [14, 16, 18, 878], "id": 14069, "original_language": "ja", "original_title": "\u6642\u3092\u304b\u3051\u308b\u5c11\u5973", "overview": "When 17-year-old Makoto Konno gains the ability to, quite literally, \"leap\" backwards through time, she immediately sets about improving her grades and preventing personal mishaps.
