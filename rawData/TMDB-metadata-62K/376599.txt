In Miles Jupp Is The Chap You\u2019re Thinking Of he discusses/touches upon/rants about himself, you, domestic imprisonment, fatherhood, having to have opinions, hot drinks, the bloody government, housing, the ageing process, other people\u2019s pants and, inevitably, a number of other things. Pretty spicy stuff, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree. Bits of it are mild-mannered, and some of it probably seems a tad on the stroppy side. Ultimately, though, it\u2019s a man standing on a stage, facing an audience, talking about some stuff and in the process aiming to cover the cost of his white goods.
