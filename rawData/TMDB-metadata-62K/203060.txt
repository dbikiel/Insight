Ari, a paramedic, is a chronic womanizer; he makes it a point of pride to never sleep with the same woman twice, and his nights are a long series of brazen one-night stands. But when Ari meets Tiina (Laura Malmivaara), something unexpected happens - he falls in love. For the first time, Ari finds himself pursuing a long-term relationship, and he makes a genuine effort to remain faithful to her. But old habits die hard; Tiina introduces Ari to her circle of friends and temptation arises as he encounters Hanna-Riikka, a theology student, and Ilona, who is soon to be married. Despite Ari's feelings for Tiina, he begins having affairs with both Hanna-Riikka and Ilona, leading to an unpleasant revelation on the day of Ilona's nuptials. ~ Mark Deming, Allrovi", "poster_path": "/2MQyo1msG02u7MPZe3IxvmPOkgZ.jpg", "release_date": "2000-01-28", "title": "Restless", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.4, "vote_count": 25, "popularity": 5.134}, {"id": 105983, "video": false, "vote_count": 11, "vote_average": 6.2, "title": "Once Upon a Time in the North", "release_date": "2012-02-17", "original_language": "fi", "original_title": "H\u00e4rm\u00e4", "genre_ids": [18], "backdrop_path": "/jBZODmWqgNDZDbHUwRz1XQz52ZD.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "19th century drama set on the plains of Ostrobothnia, western Finland, which are controlled by groups of knife-wielding thugs, the toughs.
