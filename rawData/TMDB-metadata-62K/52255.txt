His favorite playgrounds are an ice factory and the wild grass along the river. After being absent for years, his grandfather, seriously ill, reappears and settles at their house. While Bi gets closer to his grandfather, his father tries to avoid any contact with his family. Every night, he gets drunk and goes and see his masseuse, for whom he feels a quiet strong desire. Bi's mother turns a blind eye on it. The aunt, still single, meets a 16-year-old young boy in the bus. Her attraction to him moves her deeply.", "popularity": 0.6, "poster_path": "/lkZKs8fBtOrBYYxNbqEP92R3h46.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "VN", "name": "Vietnam"}], "release_date": "2010-05-19", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "vi", "name": "Ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Bi, Don't Be Afraid", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.8, "vote_count": 3, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1001, "character": "Bi", "credit_id": "56f4e8fec3a368273b0019f8", "gender": 0, "id": 1595664, "name": "Thanh Minh Phan", "order": 1, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 1004, "character": "The mother", "credit_id": "56f4e95d92514130e9000eb3", "gender": 1, "id": 1595665, "name": "Thi Kieu Trinh Nguyen", "order": 4, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 1005, "character": "The father", "credit_id": "56f4e9929251417a440016c8", "gender": 2, "id": 1428485, "name": "Nguyen Ha Phong", "order": 5, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 1006, "character": "aunt", "credit_id": "56f4e9d9c3a368273b001a16", "gender": 1, "id": 1595666, "name": "Thuy Hoa", "order": 6, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 1007, "character": "The grandfather", "credit_id": "56f4ea119251410ef7000169", "gender": 2, "id": 1307476, "name": "Tr\u1ea7n Ti\u1ebfn", "order": 7, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 1008, "character": "The nanny", "credit_id": "56f4ea399251417a4e001794", "gender": 1, "id": 1595667, "name": "Mai Chau", "order": 8, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 1009, "character": "The hairdresser", "credit_id": "56f4ea65c3a368275800172a", "gender": 1, "id": 1595668, "name": "Phuong Thao Hoang", "order": 9, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 1010, "character": "The student", "credit_id": "56f4ea8cc3a3682746001854", "gender": 2, "id": 1595499, "name": "Huynh Anh L\u00ea", "order": 10, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 1011, "character": "The Aunt's Fiance", "credit_id": "56f4eac19251417a40001613", "gender": 2, "id": 1595454, "name": "Kim Long Thach", "order": 11, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 1012, "character": "An, Bi's friend", "credit_id": "56f4eade9251417a490016f0", "gender": 2, "id": 1595669, "name": "Hoang Ha Pham", "order": 12, "profile_path": null}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4820c3a36847f8159149", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 145640, "job": "Director", "name": "Dang Di Phan", "profile_path": null}]}}
