Hit So Hard follows the rise to fame (and the near-fatal fall from it) of Patty Schemel, drummer for Courtney Love's seminal rock band, Hole. Given a Hi-8 video camera just before Hole's infamous Live Through This world tour, Patty captured stunningly intimate footage of the scene that has never been seen... until now. Not just an all-access backstage pass to the music that shaped a generation, Hit So Hard is a harrowing tale of overnight success, the cost of addiction, and ultimately, recovery and redemption.", "poster_path": "/f1SkSlIEMBmyMGVvZRR1qIEcucM.jpg", "release_date": "2012-04-20", "title": "Hit So Hard", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.8, "vote_count": 8, "popularity": 2.241}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/62vDFonl3vreT7LpMUzL3XlYy8e.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 221243, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Blackout", "overview": "Feature-length 'What-If' drama exploring the effects of a devastating cyber-attack on Britain's national electricity grid.  Based on expert advice and meticulous research, Blackout combines real user-generated footage, alongside fictional scenes, CCTV archive and news reports to build a terrifyingly realistic account of Britain being plunged into darkness.  The film plots the days following a nationwide power cut, as experienced by a cast of ordinary characters struggling to feed and protect themselves and their families. These eyewitness accounts reveal the disastrous impact of a prolonged blackout on hospitals, law and order, transport, and our food and water supplies.  The programme casts members of the public from user-generated footage, weaving real-life archive with scripted drama to tell the story of how Britain could descend into chaos and anarchy without power.", "poster_path": "/5jPehoZD9tJSF3MjxsiSvDO9HiZ.jpg", "release_date": "2013-09-08", "title": "Blackout", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.5, "vote_count": 6, "popularity": 1.097}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/fNw4pp95IXo2L3vY9WOL2Oovx46.jpg", "genre_ids": [10751], "id": 99754, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Pooch and the Pauper", "overview": "The bulldog Liberty (who's thoughts we're able to hear) is the \"First Dog of the USA\", i.e. the president's dog.
