A woman ? No. A bouncing line with harmonious rhythm. I evoke a luminous projection on veils ! Precise matter ! No. Fluid rhythms. Why should one disregard, on screen, the pleasure that movement brings us in the theatre ? Harmony of lines. Harmony of light. Lines, surfaces, volumes evolving directly, without the artifice of evocation, in the logic of its forms, dispossessed of any overly human sense, allowing an elevation towards the abstract, thus giving more space to sensations and to dreams : integral cinema. \u2014Germaine Dulac", "poster_path": "/16v3oaNOT1BVdJ46mHKfGzk5Pby.jpg", "release_date": "1928-01-01", "title": "Themes and Variations", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 6, "popularity": 1.141}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 143527, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Sound??", "overview": "Although Rahsaan Roland Kirk and John Cage never actually meet in this film (Cage's enigmatic questions about sound are intercut with some of Kirk's more ambitious experiments with it) these two very different musical iconoclasts share a similar vision of the boundless possibilities of music.", "poster_path": "/S4eOwVzoQMKT4ScojN8bU8D7Jv.jpg", "release_date": "1966-02-09", "title": "Sound??", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.3, "vote_count": 3, "popularity": 0.946}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [16], "id": 215158, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Around Perception", "overview": "An early experiment in employing computers to animate film.
