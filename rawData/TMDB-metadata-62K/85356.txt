J. Cronin's 1935 novel of the same name, about injustices in a mining community in North East England.  While the novel follows the development of three young men in the small mining town, the film focuses on just one of them; the smart David Fenwick who gets a scholarship to university, meets a girl who only marries him because her former boyfriend has abandoned her, and eventually returns to the mine town as a teacher and takes part in a futile rescue effort when the mine is flooded, trapping both his father and his younger brother.", "poster_path": "/jkzB5Fe8CCqfm5vaucxCCMdB8pr.jpg", "release_date": "1940-01-22", "title": "The Stars Look Down", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.4, "vote_count": 7, "popularity": 2.759}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [35], "id": 166122, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Here Comes Trouble", "overview": "A blundering rookie reporter runs into some unexpected difficulty when he is assigned to cover the police beat.", "poster_path": "/ejJdM75ZdQWqFL8HAUbfQ5p6Rzi.jpg", "release_date": "1948-03-15", "title": "Here Comes Trouble", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.2, "vote_count": 3, "popularity": 1.359}, {"id": 214559, "video": false, "vote_count": 3, "vote_average": 5.2, "title": "The Torch", "release_date": "1950-06-02", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Torch", "genre_ids": [28, 12, 18, 10752], "backdrop_path": "/m8Dfvh0Vk9N8RX49kOsO9ZtdZDw.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "The story of a fear-inspiring revolutionary general who develops a passion for the daughter of a wealthy villager.
