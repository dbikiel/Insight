As the Second World War was coming to a close, the US Office of Strategic Services trained and parachuted two Jewish refugees and a German deserter deep into Nazi occupied Austria. Through vivid first-person accounts, re-enactments, archival footage and learned commentary, the film reveals how their efforts disrupted a vital supply route between Germany and the Italian front to bring about the surrender of Innsbruck to Allied Forces. Their unbelievable adventure has a finale that beats any Hollywood movie hands down \u2014 but a story so powerful that it became the basis for Quentin Tarantino\u2019s mega hit.", "popularity": 1.723, "poster_path": "/eunqs8kybaElqu2U0XzU3ARCR2r.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 108883, "logo_path": null, "name": "Storyline Entertainment", "origin_country": "CA"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CA", "name": "Canada"}], "release_date": "2012-11-08", "revenue": 0, "runtime": null, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Real Inglorious Bastards", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.8, "vote_count": 6, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": []}}
