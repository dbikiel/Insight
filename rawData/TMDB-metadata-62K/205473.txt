Set in the 18th century, the film recounts the exploits of Rogers' Rangers, a band of adventurers devoted to seeking out a \"northwest passage\" through Canada. At this juncture, however, Major Rogers (Howard Petrie) is more concerned with helping the British forces at Fort Ticonderoga during a series of French and Indian raids. Top billing is bestowed upon George Montgomery as Captain Pedediah Horn, Rogers' right-hand man. The film boasts two leading ladies: Joan Vohs, as a suspected French spy, and Phyllis Fowler as a married Indian woman who falls in love with Captain Horn. Fort Ti was filmed in 3D, and in typical William Castle fashion the stereoscopic gimmick is exploited to the hilt.", "popularity": 2.044, "poster_path": "/cVWGFpaIigR0pMz5qJaLltXHllv.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 5, "logo_path": "/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png", "name": "Columbia Pictures", "origin_country": "US"}, {"id": 13578, "logo_path": null, "name": "Esskay Pictures Corporation", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1953-04-30", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 73, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "THE FIRST GREAT OUTDOOR EPIC OF AMERICA IN 3-DIMENSIONS", "title": "Fort Ti", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 157788, "name": "british soldier"}, {"id": 158264, "name": "indian war"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 9023, "video": false, "vote_count": 2353, "vote_average": 7.6, "title": "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron", "release_date": "2002-05-24", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron", "genre_ids": [12, 16, 35, 18, 37, 10751], "backdrop_path": "/7UzVI4BepB9g8822H7UCXPjrMan.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "As a wild stallion travels across the frontiers of the Old West, he befriends a young human and finds true love with a mare.", "poster_path": "/nhrcR2KtVjXxJNSrPvcxVSyEf4c.jpg", "popularity": 26.595}, {"id": 8619, "video": false, "vote_count": 1675, "vote_average": 7.1, "title": "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World", "release_date": "2003-11-14", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World", "genre_ids": [12, 18, 10752], "backdrop_path": "/uuPbSNgk2dfhMH8l4cKSQUBBk6k.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "After an abrupt and violent encounter with a French warship inflicts severe damage upon his ship, a captain of the British Royal Navy begins a chase over two oceans to capture or destroy the enemy, though he must weigh his commitment to duty and ferocious pursuit of glory against the safety of his devoted crew, including the ship's thoughtful surgeon, his best friend.", "poster_path": "/s1cVTQEZYn4nSjZLnFbzLP0j8y2.jpg", "popularity": 32.183}, {"id": 311324, "video": false, "vote_count": 3068, "vote_average": 5.8, "title": "The Great Wall", "release_date": "2016-12-16", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Great Wall", "genre_ids": [28, 12, 14], "backdrop_path": "/xeHe0f7RdsZzjW76si6fGUmu2Qq.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "European mercenaries searching for black powder become embroiled in the defense of the Great Wall of China against a horde of monstrous creatures.", "poster_path": "/p70dq1YxabemdZDm5K6Q8G10wSn.jpg", "popularity": 20.369}, {"id": 9064, "video": false, "vote_count": 470, "vote_average": 6.3, "title": "Hellbound: Hellraiser II", "release_date": "1988-12-23", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Hellbound: Hellraiser II", "genre_ids": [27, 53], "backdrop_path": "/ep55nYaivzIZuhKs0Ad7ZnMn75A.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Doctor Channard is sent a new patient, a girl warning of the terrible creatures that have destroyed her family, Cenobites who offer the most intense sensations of pleasure and pain.
