Drawing on over 30 years of unique and never-seen-before footage, 'The Image You Missed' is an experimental essay film that weaves together a history of the Northern Irish 'Troubles' with the story of a son's search for his father. In the process, the film creates a candid encounter between two filmmakers born into different political moments, revealing their contrasting experiences of Irish nationalism, the role of images in social struggle, and the competing claims of personal and political responsibility.", "popularity": 3.065, "poster_path": "/D7mdBzDOLEM9tdrCpARyaDJonH.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}, {"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}, {"iso_3166_1": "IE", "name": "Ireland"}, {"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "2018-03-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 73, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Image You Missed", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 2, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 3, "character": "", "credit_id": "5bd7676bc3a36821000539b7", "gender": 0, "id": 2046745, "name": "Arthur MacCaig", "order": 1, "profile_path": null}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "5a60c72e0e0a261037000642", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1300893, "job": "Director", "name": "Donal Foreman", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5a7405eec3a36859cc01982d", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 1971380, "job": "Producer", "name": "Nicole Brenez", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5a740606c3a3685a0c018d81", "department": "Production", "gender": 2, "id": 567750, "job": "Producer", "name": "Philippe Grandrieux", "profile_path": "/h5CPJMx6rNGNudf03um7kc7PRui.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "5cad5bac92514162f2000018", "department": "Editing", "gender": 0, "id": 1300893, "job": "Editor", "name": "Donal Foreman", "profile_path": null}]}}
