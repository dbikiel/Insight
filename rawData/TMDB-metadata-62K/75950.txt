La West is cast as Fay Lawrence, a famous Broadway actress who is loved intensely by her producer Tony Ferris (William Gaxton). Rival producer Forrest Stanton (Alan Dinehart) steals Fay away from Ferris by convincing her that she's been blacklisted from Broadway by blue-nosed moralist Hannah Bainbridge (Almira Sessions). Meanwhile, Hannah's puckish brother Hubert (Victor Moore) syphons money from his sister's \"clean up show business\" committee to produce a musical show for his actress niece Janey (Mary Roche). Somehow, all these characters converge for a spectacular closing production number spotlighting the formidable Fay. Part of the reason for the failure of The Heat's On is the fact that Mae West didn't write her own dialogue, as was usually her custom. The film performed so poorly that it would be 27 years before West would again appear on the Big Screen.", "popularity": 0.763, "poster_path": "/xbO55CLfwIaHSSwv5DRJOb6GAHA.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 20186, "logo_path": null, "name": "Gregory Ratoff Productions", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 5, "logo_path": "/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png", "name": "Columbia Pictures", "origin_country": "US"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1943-12-02", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 78, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "Turn on the Fun!
