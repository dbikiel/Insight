The dancers are believed to be veteran members of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. Filmed again at the Black Maria studios by both Dickson and Heise the 'Buffalo Dance' warriors were named as Hair Coat, Parts His Hair and Last Horse. Its quite strange seeing these movies at first they all stand around waiting to begin and as they start some of the dancers look at the camera in an almost sad way at having lost their way of life.", "poster_path": "/4YD0GzfmGq33KJhkRuDUefTrlVn.jpg", "release_date": "1894-09-23", "title": "Buffalo Dance", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.4, "vote_count": 16, "popularity": 1.191}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [28, 99], "id": 33318, "original_language": "xx", "original_title": "Men Boxing", "overview": "Experimental film fragment made with the Edison-Dickson-Heise experimental horizontal-feed kinetograph camera and viewer, using 3/4-inch wide film.", "poster_path": "/7csTEvz5gWAUwB5FpybN4GI25jq.jpg", "release_date": "1891-04-30", "title": "Men Boxing", "video": false, "vote_average": 3.9, "vote_count": 18, "popularity": 1.251}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99], "id": 194085, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Akrobatisches Potpourri", "overview": "Eight circus performers known as the Grunato family perform their famous balancing act.", "poster_path": "/fojcvoRPjXa9P2PXSSYkuvyN6ge.jpg", "release_date": "1895-11-01", "title": "Akrobatisches Potpourri", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.5, "vote_count": 8, "popularity": 1.307}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 332353, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Annabelle Sun Dance", "overview": "Annabelle Dances in William K.L.

Nevertheless, she was a staple in the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show and similar wild west companies. Because of her diminutive stature, she was billed as \"Little Sure Shot.\" The man assisting her is this appearance is probably her husband, Frank E. Butler. Annie had outshot Butler (a famous dead-eye marksman himself) in a shooting contest in the 1880's. Instead of nursing his bruised ego because he had been throughly outgunned by a woman, Butler fell in love, married Little Sure Shot, and became her manager.", "poster_path": "/onLyR1ktBBLWQjBBNcO78HalgJc.jpg", "release_date": "1894-11-01", "title": "Annie Oakley", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 20, "popularity": 1.126}], "total_pages": 2, "total_results": 40}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4d4f9251416c75136e1d", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 110347, "job": "Director", "name": "William K.L.
