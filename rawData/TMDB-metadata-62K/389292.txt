With insights from top engineers and designers, \"APEX\" pulls back the curtain on the top-secret development facilities at Porsche, Ferrari, McLaren and Pagani, where awe-inspiring hypercars are imagined and built, and puts you inches from the action, as top drivers shake down the latest hypercars, flat-out on some of the world's greatest racetracks.", "popularity": 4.523, "poster_path": "/91IFnw5YZVEilqhwqmSkewrHyU5.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2016-03-29", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 85, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "APEX: The Story of the Hypercar", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.2, "vote_count": 22, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 380856, "video": false, "vote_count": 9, "vote_average": 5.1, "title": "A Stand Up Guy", "release_date": "2016-02-09", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "A Stand Up Guy", "genre_ids": [35], "backdrop_path": "/cLcjoTEjbZAyRZzTdXuamWaWVKW.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A low-level mobster takes a stab at stand-up comedy while in the Witness Protection Program.", "poster_path": "/uvsPkx9W3eyPoPQwApSk07jWhkr.jpg", "popularity": 3.729}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [10749, 18], "id": 284550, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Hard to Get", "overview": "TK is a handsome and charming womanizer who runs at the first mention of commitment.
