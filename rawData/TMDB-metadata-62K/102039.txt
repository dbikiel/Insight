Pulp-serial snippets, industrial-film imagery, and B- (and Z-) fiction clips are intercut with newly shot live-action material, powering a playful, allegorical trajectory through the now-mythic occult matrix of Jack Parsons (Crowleyite founder of the Jet Propulsion Lab), L.Ron Hubbard (sci-fi author turned cult-leader), and Marjorie Cameron (bohemian artist and \"mother of the New Age movement\"). Their intertwined tales spin out into a speculative farce on the militarization of space, and the corporate take-over of spiritual fulfillment and leisure-time.", "popularity": 1.39, "poster_path": "/bfL66a8c2PFWbMfJ8eSquSykkTD.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2008-01-14", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 114, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Mock Up on Mu", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 5, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/psI57FEB10aMshBVaNO0f5OUkRw.jpg", "genre_ids": [80, 18, 53], "id": 372174, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "House of Manson", "overview": "An unflinching chronicle of Charles Manson, the ex-con who was able to amass a dedicated following of young people in the late 1960s.
