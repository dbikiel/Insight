The trouble began when the daughter wanted to marry Mr. Braun's doctor, James Rogers. Mrs. Braun asks Inspector Queen to help find the long-missing Barbara. The inspector's son, Ellery, works on the case. He goes to a home frequently visited by Dr. Rogers where the bell is answered by Nikki Porter who Ellery mistakes for Barbara and insists she return to the Braun home. Nikki does, to protect Barbara, and a short time later finds herself alone in a room outside Braun's bedroom. She finds him dead - his throat cut. No weapons are found and the door to the room where Nikki had been is locked, and she is suspected. Ellery hides Nikki in his apartment. Braun's body, sent for an autopsy, disappears and in its place is a life-sized statue of the dead man.", "popularity": 1.829, "poster_path": "/2Uapxv7IGeqAaDEghMykDIHW2fp.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 5, "logo_path": "/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png", "name": "Columbia Pictures", "origin_country": "US"}, {"id": 4977, "logo_path": null, "name": "Larry Darmour Productions", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1940-11-30", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 69, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "HE'S ON THE SCREEN NOW!", "title": "Ellery Queen, Master Detective", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 4715, "name": "autopsy"}, {"id": 10920, "name": "radio program"}, {"id": 166484, "name": "raven"}, {"id": 166485, "name": "ellery queen"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/lCtlmlT2n6uvdzSOqXGQ3NaYaRG.jpg", "genre_ids": [27, 9648], "id": 397243, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Autopsy of Jane Doe", "overview": "Father and son coroners receive a mysterious unidentified corpse with no apparent cause of death.
