When drifter Tony Fitzjohn (John Michie) arrives to work for the old men he initially takes poorly to the task, almost savaged by a lion on his first day and on the verge of leaving when he hears that his predecessor was killed in a similar incident. The arrival of a lion cub that Fitzjohn must care for and raise changes everything. Soon he finds himself helping the brothers in their fight to save lions - and, ultimately, the park itself - from the poachers, soldiers and corrupt government officials that threaten them.", "poster_path": "/4cKNcbeYav6JN7lrMaucpZ8oo8k.jpg", "release_date": "1999-06-04", "title": "To Walk with Lions", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.7, "vote_count": 7, "popularity": 2.327}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/oxQSAIEB8BKZ5aPlx2FNSMl7AiL.jpg", "genre_ids": [12, 18], "id": 171780, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Sweet Talk", "overview": "A blocked writer and a troubled young woman who meet over a phone-sex line go on a journey together.", "poster_path": "/neM9fDwVjd3djYf39WouUBN1JRC.jpg", "release_date": "2013-03-02", "title": "Sweet Talk", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.1, "vote_count": 7, "popularity": 4.539}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/w79dNHVNlng3X552v97DqpjZOTV.jpg", "genre_ids": [27], "id": 227172, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Hallows' Eve", "overview": "Years after a tragic accident leaves a young child scarred for life, the people responsible pay - with their lives.", "poster_path": "/7U0CzQJUCObiWRFA9J6MHLrUPSy.jpg", "release_date": "2013-10-01", "title": "Hallows' Eve", "video": false, "vote_average": 3.0, "vote_count": 9, "popularity": 4.012}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [10749], "id": 440679, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Princess and the Barrio Boy", "overview": "A teenager who dreams of becoming an Olympic swimmer has a romance with a boy from the wrong side of town.", "poster_path": "/xyecOZqEUEaJDyLrRXaO75u2MDD.jpg", "release_date": "2000-12-08", "title": "The Princess and the Barrio Boy", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 3.546}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/yUEpdR58JXmlcCk76HWUMkFQQNh.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 268536, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "A Master Builder", "overview": "A successful, ego-maniacal architect who has spent a lifetime bullying his wife, employees and mistresses wants to make peace as his life approaches its final act.", "poster_path": "/hlvs2omrrjg28XmQGG3jUKTZ5aZ.jpg", "release_date": "2013-11-11", "title": "A Master Builder", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 10, "popularity": 4.927}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [9648, 27, 53], "id": 360205, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Invoked", "overview": "A group of young people went on a abandoned hostel in Sligo, Ireland.
