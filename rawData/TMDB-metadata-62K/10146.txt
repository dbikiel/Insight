Fritz Knobel (based on real-life forger Konrad Kujau) supports himself by faking and selling Nazi memorabilia. When Knobel writes and sells a volume of Hitler's (nonexistent) diaries, he thinks it's just another job.  When sleazy journalist Hermann Willi\u00e9 learns of the diaries, however, he quickly realizes their potential value... and Knobel is quickly in over his head. As the pressure builds and Knobel is forced to deliver more and more volumes of the fake diaries, he finds himself acting increasingly like the man whose life he is rewriting. The film is a romping and hilarious satire, poking fun not only at the events and characters involved in the hoax (who are only thinly disguised in the film), but at the discomfort Germany has with its difficult past.", "poster_path": "/lAcwO4mXidQeXU09dcZFIC16z3Z.jpg", "release_date": "1992-03-12", "title": "Schtonk!", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.2, "vote_count": 32, "popularity": 5.555}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/hHNofCnyA0VNA8Z2GLHQJNJ8VmO.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 14, 878, 10751, 9648], "id": 2265, "original_language": "de", "original_title": "Momo", "overview": "In the ruins of an amphitheatre just outside an unnamed Italian city lives Momo, a little girl of mysterious origin.
