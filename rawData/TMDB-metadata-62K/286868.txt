Warner Bros.' Captain Thunder contains some of the darndest Mexican accents you've ever heard in your life.  The star is Hungarian-born Victor Varconi, portraying a legendary south of the border outlaw who tries to force Canadian senorita Fay Wray to marry a rival rustler whom she despises.  She pleads with the bandito so pathetically that he is moved to grant her a single wish.  Without hesitation she chooses her poor but true love. The bandit king, being a somewhat honorable fellow grants the wish and without a twitch, guns down the wicked cattle thief.  Fortunately the film was played for comedy, a wise decision since it probably would have garnered laughs as a straight drama anyway.", "popularity": 1.4, "poster_path": "/5TVzRhh7jqwVweZCPjQBXAZgQ5d.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 9329, "logo_path": "/aue5pVfj9TcjYEOufkcuCbAL5hE.png", "name": "The Vitaphone Corporation", "origin_country": "US"}, {"id": 174, "logo_path": "/IuAlhI9eVC9Z8UQWOIDdWRKSEJ.png", "name": "Warner Bros.
