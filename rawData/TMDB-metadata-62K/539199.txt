The film more properly belongs, however, to choreographer Frederick Ashmore, composer John Lanchbery, and costume designer Rostislav Douboujinsky. This literal adaptation concerns the shy Beatrix Potter and how, when all of the toy animals in her room come to life, she emerges from her shell and begins to enjoy life.

The film deals with the situation of a strike and, during its first half, methodically analyzes the different components of the strike: the workers, the radical students who encourage the strike while not quite being able to communicate in the same terms as the workers, the union delegates and other middlemen who preach moderation and compromise, the employers who demand the immediate resumption of work, the police state that suppresses the strike on behalf of capitalism.", "poster_path": "/dvnna5uRYyT63FI7MTO3U9O6JIi.jpg", "popularity": 1.885}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99], "id": 119767, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The River", "overview": "This short Depression-era documentary describes the importance of the Mississippi River to the United States.
