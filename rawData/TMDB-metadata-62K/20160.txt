But when Ari meets Tiina (Laura Malmivaara), something unexpected happens - he falls in love. For the first time, Ari finds himself pursuing a long-term relationship, and he makes a genuine effort to remain faithful to her. But old habits die hard; Tiina introduces Ari to her circle of friends and temptation arises as he encounters Hanna-Riikka, a theology student, and Ilona, who is soon to be married. Despite Ari's feelings for Tiina, he begins having affairs with both Hanna-Riikka and Ilona, leading to an unpleasant revelation on the day of Ilona's nuptials. ~ Mark Deming, Allrovi", "popularity": 5.134, "poster_path": "/2MQyo1msG02u7MPZe3IxvmPOkgZ.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 6339, "logo_path": "/ufP8NkiJ9ScGLIKz7J25xKtmVvX.png", "name": "Solar Films", "origin_country": "FI"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FI", "name": "Finland"}], "release_date": "2000-01-28", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 106, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fi", "name": "suomi"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Restless", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.4, "vote_count": 25, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 53503, "video": false, "vote_count": 12, "vote_average": 5.0, "title": "Me and Morrison", "release_date": "2001-12-28", "original_language": "fi", "original_title": "Min\u00e4 ja Morrison", "genre_ids": [80, 18, 10749], "backdrop_path": null, "adult": false, "overview": "A bittersweet tale of a love affair between two people whose lives seem to have lost all direction.
