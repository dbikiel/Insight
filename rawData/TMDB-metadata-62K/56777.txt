The international volunteer crew, under-trained and under-equipped, develop a combination of bizarre and brilliant tactics with which to stop the whalers. But first they must find the Japanese ships, a far more difficult challenge than ever imagined - long-time activist Paul Watson and first-time captain Alex Cornelissen employ an array of strategies in the hopes of finding an elusive adversary in the vast expanse of the Ross Sea. With one ship (the Farley Mowat) too slow to chase down the whaling fleet, with their second ship (the Robert Hunter) unsuited for Antarctic ice conditions and with no country supporting their efforts to enforce international law, the situation becomes increasingly desperate. Against all odds, however, a real-life pirate tale unfolds - a modern-day \"David vs. Goliath\" adventure.", "popularity": 2.259, "poster_path": "/znedUUcXH00elpwQB5xVKzQLlqU.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 7023, "logo_path": null, "name": "Endeavour Media", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2008-10-03", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 97, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "At the Edge of the World", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 8, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 18330, "name": "nature"}, {"id": 33829, "name": "whaling"}, {"id": 33830, "name": "sea shepherd"}, {"id": 33832, "name": "eco adventure"}, {"id": 156388, "name": "environmentalism"}, {"id": 213971, "name": "activism"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 214314, "video": false, "vote_count": 94, "vote_average": 7.3, "title": "Bears", "release_date": "2014-04-17", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Bears", "genre_ids": [99], "backdrop_path": "/wA8Dct9suP3tZWH1nv7ikQThvD2.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Filmmakers Alastair Fothergill and Keith Scholey chronicle a year in the lives of an Alaskan brown bear named Sky and her cubs, Scout and Amber.
