The town's rabbi dies, and a sub-plot develops in which Max's father (Aaron Schwartz) and grandfather (Jan Rubes)-both synagogue leaders-are saddled with a traditional Hassidic rabbi who sticks out like a sore thumb among the otherwise assimilated Jewish community.  To make matters more difficult, Max likes a Catholic girl (14 year old Fairuza Baulk in just her third film), whom he later competes with in a piano competition.  The quirky, fun-loving rabbi tries to help him with his problems, yet harbours a secret ambition of his own.\r Filmed in Winnipeg and rural Beausejour, Manitoba, Canada.", "popularity": 0.84, "poster_path": "/rhQ2u3uawoIzjSCrXtR1Tip6ePa.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 53306, "logo_path": null, "name": "Southgate Entertainment", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 10473, "logo_path": "/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png", "name": "National Film Board of Canada", "origin_country": "CA"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CA", "name": "Canada"}], "release_date": "1988-09-16", "revenue": 317, "runtime": 95, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "When Max was born they cut off his ....
