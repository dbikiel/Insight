Through extensive research and interviews with the nation\u2019s top divorce lawyers, mediators, judges, politicians, litigants and journalists, DIVORCE CORP. uncovers how children are torn from their homes, unlicensed custody evaluators extort money, and abusive judges play god with people\u2019s lives while enriching their friends. This explosive documentary reveals the family courts as unregulated, extra-constitutional fiefdoms. Rather than assist victims of domestic crimes, these courts often precipitate them. And rather than help parents and children move on, as they are mandated to do, these courts - and their associates - drag out cases for years, sometimes decades, ultimately resulting in a rash of social ills, including home foreclosure, bankruptcy, suicide and violence.", "poster_path": "/5ZI3ecraeoUbJ6zLaZ8CBEYea4F.jpg", "release_date": "2014-01-10", "title": "Divorce Corp.", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.8, "vote_count": 8, "popularity": 2.294}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/rGzuBbOmfaaQibxRegLlnkaLKsk.jpg", "genre_ids": [14, 878], "id": 108061, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Ravagers", "overview": "In a post-apocalyptic world divided between two groups called the Flockers and the Ravagers, an adventurer and his \"pleasure girl\" try to find their way to a rumored safe haven called the Land of Genesis.", "poster_path": "/awBkIIJulVIRNsREvI6BNEwUf2x.jpg", "release_date": "1979-05-01", "title": "Ravagers", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.6, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 3.906}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [878], "id": 331985, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Sundays", "overview": "Set in Mexico City sometime in the future and starring US actor Brian Petsos and Mexican actress Sofia Sisniega, SUNDAYS is an ambitious philosophical science-fiction proof-of-concept short.
