Wildlife biologists risk life and limb to track the tiger and research its movements and habits. They sedate the animals so the tigers can be measured and collared. One Russian scientist is shown raising two tigers which he found orphaned as cubs. He keeps the tigers in a cage, then allows the beasts into a fenced forest-like enclosure. The efforts of these scientists are in contrast to those of poachers, who kill the tigers for their pelts, as well as for body parts to be marketed in traditional Chinese medicine.", "popularity": 1.137, "poster_path": "/svvVT8yDsI2bcRzHH3gIiqcTWDx.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 7521, "logo_path": "/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png", "name": "National Geographic", "origin_country": "US"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1997-04-04", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 56, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ru", "name": "P\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439"}, {"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Tigers of the Snow", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 2, "character": "Narrator (voice)", "credit_id": "560062029251414e4d000444", "gender": 2, "id": 26660, "name": "Richard Kiley", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/gd0wZUwusAdm37LJmetsZnJK7Yw.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "560061e79251414e4a000402", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 116496, "job": "Director", "name": "Mark Stouffer", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "560061f1c3a3685f45000492", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 1248183, "job": "Writer", "name": "Kevin McCarey", "profile_path": null}]}}
