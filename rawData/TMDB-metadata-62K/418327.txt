But when Crew (Daniel DiTomasso) invites his girlfriend Sara (Kate French) into the family, distrust begins to bubble between the siblings. Seeing Sara as a threat, Brie (Fiona Dourif) grows spiteful and increasingly suspicious that she is being replaced. That is, until the night Crew attempts to murder her in their family house.  Traumatized, Brie is sent to a mental facility where she is tormented by hallucinations of Crew from the night of the attack. But when the visions begin to bleed into reality, Brie starts to fear that it\u2019s not just her sanity that\u2019s in danger, and she flees the facility. In a frantic attempt to return to her remaining siblings and warn them, Brie begins to uncover a trail of gory, sinister secrets that lead her to believe that she might not know her family as well as she thought.", "popularity": 2.24, "poster_path": "/6pki8WZVQW4Gghjv2j9AtmBVGtW.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2016-09-02", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 80, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "It Runs In The Family", "title": "Blood Is Blood", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 7, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/ddI9iOz60z2nHYBhkndcuvz7PbB.jpg", "genre_ids": [53, 10770], "id": 533165, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Counterfeiting in Suburbia", "overview": "Two teenagers have convinced themselves they're not doing anyone any harm by counterfeiting money but it all takes a dark turn when their debt-ridden art teacher finds out they are using his classroom to make the counterfeit bills.", "poster_path": "/ds63bEU6qtcvFflya1Ad8VMfY8L.jpg", "release_date": "2018-07-01", "title": "Counterfeiting in Suburbia", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.8, "vote_count": 6, "popularity": 4.791}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/4X1N1Diiv1OsyvLuxAhzYmCTMCF.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 53, 9648, 10749, 80], "id": 417809, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Fatal Crossing", "overview": "When high-flying tech entrepreneur Carson Griffin believes himself guilty of killing a pedestrian while driving drunk, guilt and paranoia begin to unravel his life ahead of the launch of his new company as he plays a dangerous game of cat and mouse with June, the girlfriend of the deceased who is hell-bent on proving he is responsible.", "poster_path": "/nOuXSXTNX8x85wHky4Rphw4ry00.jpg", "release_date": "2017-11-19", "title": "Fatal Crossing", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 3, "popularity": 3.021}, {"id": 515387, "video": false, "vote_count": 5, "vote_average": 6.4, "title": "American Exorcist", "release_date": "2018-10-26", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "American Exorcist", "genre_ids": [27], "backdrop_path": "/qxNnarGOQCktr4t48WW55Z3uC8e.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A paranormal investigator, trapped in a haunted skyscraper on Christmas Eve.
