When arrested, he claims to have committed the crime alone. Some eyewitnesses say the robber seemed to have been in a trance, which makes the case even more complicated and peculiar. Olsen finds out that the accused has been in prison with the charismatic Bj\u00f6rn Schow Nielsen and begins to suspect that Nielsen had hypnotized his fellow inmate to commit the crime for him. But could it be possible \u2013 and if so, how can the true perpetrator be caught? Olsen seeks help from a well-known psychiatrist specialized in hypnosis, with whom Olsen delves deeper into the world of mental manipulation. Absorbed in the criminal investigation, Olsen does not realize that the mysterious Nielsen has secretly befriended his young wife. Soon the mysterious case touches him closer than he could have imagined.", "popularity": 3.149, "poster_path": "/9wLqHa5wGLgRqGyNaEa5YRrEtVk.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 70772, "logo_path": "/4dZxmrKg3uLLnI6oXqOKFIaXrgZ.png", "name": "Art Films Production", "origin_country": "FI"}, {"id": 96164, "logo_path": null, "name": "MP Films", "origin_country": "HR"}, {"id": 96165, "logo_path": null, "name": "T\u00e4htiloiste Elokuvatuotanto", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FI", "name": "Finland"}, {"iso_3166_1": "DK", "name": "Denmark"}, {"iso_3166_1": "HR", "name": "Croatia"}], "release_date": "2018-03-29", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 110, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "Who controls your mind?", "title": "The Guardian Angel", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.7, "vote_count": 10, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 3363, "name": "hypnosis"}, {"id": 15363, "name": "bank robbery"}, {"id": 208611, "name": "1950s"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 22907, "video": false, "vote_count": 686, "vote_average": 6.2, "title": "Takers", "release_date": "2010-08-26", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Takers", "genre_ids": [28, 80, 18, 53], "backdrop_path": "/n6FokmbxhCWH0ad7i1lJzAbrZqK.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A seasoned team of bank robbers, including Gordon Jennings (Idris Elba), John Rahway (Paul Walker), A.J.
