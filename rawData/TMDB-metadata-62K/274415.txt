When Knobel writes and sells a volume of Hitler's (nonexistent) diaries, he thinks it's just another job.  When sleazy journalist Hermann Willi\u00e9 learns of the diaries, however, he quickly realizes their potential value... and Knobel is quickly in over his head. As the pressure builds and Knobel is forced to deliver more and more volumes of the fake diaries, he finds himself acting increasingly like the man whose life he is rewriting. The film is a romping and hilarious satire, poking fun not only at the events and characters involved in the hoax (who are only thinly disguised in the film), but at the discomfort Germany has with its difficult past.", "poster_path": "/lAcwO4mXidQeXU09dcZFIC16z3Z.jpg", "release_date": "1992-03-12", "title": "Schtonk!", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.2, "vote_count": 32, "popularity": 5.555}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/hRAt1qSRPVCLO5Ob4TfH5wKiXXn.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 18], "id": 1740, "original_language": "de", "original_title": "Nackt", "overview": "Nackt is the story of three couples, one of which just broke up, one that seems to be about to and one perfectly okay.
