Based on a series of paintings by the Polish artists and filmmaker Walerian Borowczyk, Les Jeux des Anges takes the viewer into a nightmarish and sinister labyrinth world. With images reminiscent of Bosch and Ernst and an abstract soundtrack the film evoke unspeakable horrors lurking at the heart Borowczyk's masterpiece. Borowczyk described the film himself as \"A report on the city of angels.\"", "poster_path": "/zWnQHqbkJbeQo6edBD9KLmVBjI.jpg", "release_date": "1964-12-31", "title": "The Games of Angels", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.5, "vote_count": 22, "popularity": 3.083}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/sLXaTgSIvgBLFgrYGLjIKehhVXQ.jpg", "genre_ids": [99, 36], "id": 144425, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "A Trip Down Market St. before the Fire", "overview": "A Trip Down Market Street is a 13-minute actuality film recorded by placing a movie camera on the front of a cable car as it travels down San Francisco\u2019s Market Street.
