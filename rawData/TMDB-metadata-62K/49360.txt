The woman was Nancy Spungen, an ex-prostitute, sometimes stripper, heroin addict, and girlfriend of Sex Pistols' bassist Sid Vicious. In a trial by tabloid newspapers Vicious was pronounced guilty before noon the following day. But the case never had the chance to be brought to trial, and a number of New York cops weren't convinced. Less than six months later, Sid died of a heroin overdose. For the next 28 years the assumption was that Sid did it - case closed. Over time, the death of Sid and Nancy has passed into rock legend and has only added to the controversial and notorious image of the Sex Pistols and punk music. At the request of Sid's mother, rock author and punk expert Alan Parker has devoted himself to discovering what really happened in room 100.", "popularity": 2.66, "poster_path": "/zkT66BRzRfRvOVA3ilbcORmjVbr.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2009-02-06", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 89, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Who Killed Nancy?", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 4, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [28, 35, 80, 53], "id": 57980, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Rancid Aluminium", "overview": "Pete Thompson thinks he has it all.
