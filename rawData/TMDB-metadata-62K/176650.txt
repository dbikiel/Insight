Ing'er, the daughter of a theatre-owner, welcomes the return of Shao-dung, her fiancee and a fine cellist from America. Shao-dung soon finds himself captivated by the opera \"Fleeing By Night\" and its celebrated actor, Lin Chung, whose voice seems to articulate something within himself. While Shao-dung attempts to blend eastern and western music, Ing'er becomes torn between her affection for both men, and an awareness of the growing intimacy between them.  - Written by Strand Releasing", "poster_path": "/aTI3y4fczqj8WfPlwUbqWXM5aW3.jpg", "release_date": "2000-10-14", "title": "Fleeing by Night", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 6, "popularity": 0.884}, {"id": 92989, "video": false, "vote_count": 13, "vote_average": 7.9, "title": "A Summer at Grandpa's", "release_date": "1984-11-24", "original_language": "zh", "original_title": "\u51ac\u51ac\u7684\u5047\u671f", "genre_ids": [18, 10751], "backdrop_path": "/kjERGOAqIfNKLjzVFEpxsVFujgn.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A coming-of-age story about a young brother and sister whom spend a pivotal summer in the country with their grandparents.", "poster_path": "/eLOfnk8EoUwn7sS4658uLThFUNA.jpg", "popularity": 5.138}, {"id": 44837, "video": false, "vote_count": 13, "vote_average": 6.2, "title": "Forever Enthralled", "release_date": "2008-12-05", "original_language": "zh", "original_title": "\u6885\u862d\u82b3", "genre_ids": [18, 36, 10749], "backdrop_path": "/3PbQAVY0c0MUFazJVeERZd0woTF.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A biographical account of Mei Lanfang, China's greatest opera star.", "poster_path": "/dcDDOxNZwQrjuM8zhU4nPPD0k8m.jpg", "popularity": 4.952}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 14}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 5, "character": "Kun-shu", "credit_id": "56bb169492514169c2002405", "gender": 2, "id": 1081519, "name": "Bor Jeng Chen", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/rO0CAWlNaiyKZixxxdqUWut0URg.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 6, "character": "A-chu", "credit_id": "56bb16bac3a3681b72002383", "gender": 1, "id": 136891, "name": "Yang Li-yin", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/sz7D5VZKsBvPv7dqi6Go5baSPJi.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4d75c3a36847f8262117", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 64992, "job": "Director", "name": "Hou Hsiao-hsien", "profile_path": "/lIr03NsssQ8i6pbujxKfanr4a07.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "52fe4d75c3a36847f826211d", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1158867, "job": "Director", "name": "Wan Jen", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe4d75c3a36847f8262123", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1158868, "job": "Director", "name": "Zhuang Xiang Zeng", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "532123b09251411f77002312", "department": "Writing", "gender": 2, "id": 143036, "job": "Writer", "name": "Wu Nien-Jen", "profile_path": "/zqEl0ybSYwq7yQlG5SSoQQDyuCC.jpg"}]}}
