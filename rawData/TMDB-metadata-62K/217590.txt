Richard Kaplan's lively documentary reveals the human face behind the American icon, beginning with the emotional deprivation suffered by this plain, awkward little girl born into a socially prominent and powerful family. Though she would eventually marry a man who would look beyond her awkwardness, Eleanor was not content to be the proper, silent wife to her husband Franklin's extraordinary political career. Instead, she began a lifelong crusade to speak out about injustice and oppression in any form.", "poster_path": "/fmKMKRqCVDYP6sIUw1HLRCCP8Kd.jpg", "release_date": "1965-11-08", "title": "The Eleanor Roosevelt Story", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 2.529}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/tp4b2eFQ2KW1zAnKahLlBXTd7Oc.jpg", "genre_ids": [80], "id": 42838, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Whispering Footsteps", "overview": "An Ohio bank clerk's life becomes a nightmare when his descriptions is a fit of a maniac killer.", "poster_path": "/zCMaDRgbiUtBgmRN3SPNrCoSxd5.jpg", "release_date": "1943-12-30", "title": "Whispering Footsteps", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.6, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 3.037}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [16], "id": 284957, "original_language": "cs", "original_title": "Lev a p\u00edsni\u010dka", "overview": "Story of a wandering musical beggar's encounter with a hungry lion.", "poster_path": null, "release_date": "1959-01-02", "title": "The Lion and the Song", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 1.091}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/p94PfQYtdYaoXKrdLd7r7N597p.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 137008, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "small roads", "overview": "Lengthy static shots of various backroads, smaller interstates, quieter roads, and lonely highways.", "poster_path": "/jpczFY1YxHyo87xrlmsugnhRyQq.jpg", "release_date": "2011-09-03", "title": "small roads", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.7, "vote_count": 6, "popularity": 4.168}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [36, 16, 99], "id": 208561, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Great", "overview": "An animated film about the British engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who spearheaded numerous engineering marvels of the early 19th century - including the Thames Tunnel, the Great Western Railway, and the Great Eastern steamship (for 40 years the world's largest steamship).

In both films he plays a character who is Jewish, as Dalio was in real life. In fact, in most of the French films he's in the 1930s, he almost always plays shady characters, informers, blackmailers and gangsters. In other words, he is always \"the Jew.\" When the Nazis invaded France in 1940, he fled to America and appeared in CASABLANCA and TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT. In America, he was no longer the Jew but The Frenchman. He became, in dozens of films, America's idea of a typical Frenchman. His film career has these two strands in which he has two different identities. Are you defined by other people and their perceptions of who you are? Are you always a creation of the way people want to see you? Or can you exist outside of the arbitrary boundaries which are placed on you?", "poster_path": "/bnk04Njr8wu3YPdJLA6jDP9Ecxe.jpg", "release_date": "2015-04-30", "title": "I, Dalio", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 1.741}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/77ETiF1Vh0mjWoOZ9MZl4YR2QXI.jpg", "genre_ids": [9648, 18], "id": 77678, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Talk About a Stranger", "overview": "Small-town gossips rage over the arrival of a mysterious stranger.", "poster_path": "/tERZbSpE0vcPMd3ffpYotRo3lFW.jpg", "release_date": "1952-04-18", "title": "Talk About a Stranger", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 7, "popularity": 3.377}], "total_pages": 2, "total_results": 40}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4e38c3a368484e214ef7", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1202472, "job": "Director", "name": "Morten Skallerud", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "56876d37c3a3685f8900cc3a", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 1202472, "job": "Writer", "name": "Morten Skallerud", "profile_path": null}]}}
