She reads Jeanne's journal, documenting Ren\u00e9's criminal tendencies. Solange believes him innocent, manipulated into the murder or framed. Odd psychiatrists turn up, including Georges Didier, who runs FBPS, and his rival, Christian, who believes crime originates in a story's taking hold of a person. After the verdict, Ren\u00e9 and Solange's relationship changes, Georges and his society commit a bizarre act, and the police record Solange's story.", "poster_path": "/rk2kSTisnUQFrmxkMawZe8s3rsF.jpg", "release_date": "1997-05-04", "title": "Genealogies of a Crime", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 8, "popularity": 1.265}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/xE3Y5ntcbqDz9FzwLWSVVR5qF7H.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 878], "id": 67102, "original_language": "pl", "original_title": "Test pilota Pirxa", "overview": "This movie is about a rocket pilot named Pirx who is hired to go on a mission to evaluate some nonlinears (robots) for use as crewmembers on future space flights. Pirx and his crew, made up of nonlinears and humans, are sent out to launch two satellites into the rings of Saturn. Upon returning to Earth there is an inquest to determine if Pirx was responsible for the \"accident.\" In the end, it is found that one of the robots caused the malfunction in an attempt to kill the human crewmembers and Pirx is cleared of all charges. In this tale Lem puts forth the idea that what is perceived a human weakness is in fact an advantage over a perfect machine. Pirx defeats the robot, because a human can hesitate, make wrong decisions, have doubts, but a robot cannot. A similar idea is present in Isaac Asimov's Robot Series, where putting a robot in a position where it cannot chose between the Three laws of robotics fries its positronic brain.", "poster_path": "/k82KjODX55fhEOMAUqj1rVS8Tz2.jpg", "release_date": "1979-05-27", "title": "Pilot Pirx's Inquest", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 10, "popularity": 4.641}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/kAfzBzFLEjWgHHu1tQXbHxfOHdW.jpg", "genre_ids": [], "id": 71732, "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "La raison du plus faible", "overview": "", "poster_path": "/JRwgYtupOfiO9QhhgvjUMVYR4G.jpg", "release_date": "2006-07-19", "title": "The Right of the Weakest", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.9, "vote_count": 7, "popularity": 1.96}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 13}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 3, "character": "Thomas Thomas", "credit_id": "52fe4420c3a368484e010e41", "gender": 2, "id": 87692, "name": "Beno\u00eet Verhaert", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/qGCGkypR70m0DVytr0Q62PiIgyW.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Eva", "credit_id": "52fe4420c3a368484e010e45", "gender": 0, "id": 87693, "name": "Aylin Yay", "order": 1, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Melodie", "credit_id": "52fe4420c3a368484e010e49", "gender": 0, "id": 87694, "name": "Magali Pinglaut", "order": 2, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 7, "character": "Nathalie (la m\u00e8re)", "credit_id": "52fe4420c3a368484e010e53", "gender": 0, "id": 586376, "name": "Micheline Hardy", "order": 3, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 8, "character": "le psychologue", "credit_id": "52fe4420c3a368484e010e57", "gender": 0, "id": 586377, "name": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Topart", "order": 4, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 9, "character": "l'assureur", "credit_id": "52fe4420c3a368484e010e5b", "gender": 0, "id": 126619, "name": "Alexandre von Sivers", "order": 5, "profile_path": "/2wYaPcWIEs5KXJQbd1Uxh9c9tkp.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 10, "character": "le r\u00e9ceptionniste", "credit_id": "52fe4420c3a368484e010e5f", "gender": 2, "id": 586276, "name": "Serge Larivi\u00e8re", "order": 6, "profile_path": "/5qLfruQ0jGIcQAFQ2YRRaojrhH6.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 11, "character": "Madame Zo\u00e9", "credit_id": "52fe4420c3a368484e010e63", "gender": 0, "id": 548718, "name": "Jacqueline Bollen", "order": 7, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 12, "character": "Vanessa", "credit_id": "52fe4420c3a368484e010e67", "gender": 1, "id": 586378, "name": "Dominique Baeyens", "order": 8, "profile_path": "/6crU6kqdNcC4eLMg0X1MTWU4zEq.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4420c3a368484e010e3d", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 87690, "job": "Director", "name": "Pierre-Paul Renders", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe4420c3a368484e010e4f", "department": "Writing", "gender": 2, "id": 19985, "job": "Writer", "name": "Philippe Blasband", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5c3247cd925141645171fe99", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 240087, "job": "Producer", "name": "Jacques Bidou", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5c3247e4c3a36879cfa6f063", "department": "Production", "gender": 1, "id": 100747, "job": "Producer", "name": "Diana Elbaum", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5c3247ef0e0a267eb33ebd1b", "department": "Crew", "gender": 1, "id": 108059, "job": "Cinematography", "name": "Virginie Saint-Martin", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5c3247f7c3a3682919ab96d4", "department": "Sound", "gender": 0, "id": 1943359, "job": "Sound", "name": "Olivier Hespel", "profile_path": null}]}}
