He had his cinematographer Gary Graver film the session with a view to editing highlights of the footage into the projected film. Graver observed, \"A lot of people were there in the audience that day who are successful filmmakers now\",[1] as well as several noted film critics such as Joseph McBride and Todd McCarthy.[2]  However, Welles never got round to editing the raw footage. Its only use in Welles' lifetime was by BBC journalist Leslie Megahy for his 1982 Arena documentary on Welles; specifically, the documentary features a young man asking Welles whether he would agree he has been persecuted by The Establishment and the capitalist system, and Welles being somewhat bemused by the question.", "popularity": 1.428, "poster_path": "/2iqLhvhmFMohZgRsSUiulKIEeIg.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1981-02-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 82, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Filming 'The Trial'", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 2, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "583a19ffc3a368473f008799", "gender": 2, "id": 40, "name": "Orson Welles", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/k7a0gp3HKWT5uBmfirM74vackiV.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "583a19ef9251416f690090c3", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 40, "job": "Director", "name": "Orson Welles", "profile_path": "/k7a0gp3HKWT5uBmfirM74vackiV.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "583a1a0cc3a3681cdc00da6e", "department": "Production", "gender": 2, "id": 40, "job": "Producer", "name": "Orson Welles", "profile_path": "/k7a0gp3HKWT5uBmfirM74vackiV.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "583a1a1f925141707d008be1", "department": "Camera", "gender": 2, "id": 30683, "job": "Director of Photography", "name": "Gary Graver", "profile_path": "/hgxyf9QroD3VyKefTXt8ymxCP2t.jpg"}]}}
