They sleep together on the day they first meet.  \"Camel(s)\" is a one-night story of a middle-aged couple who visited a small port village named 'Wol-got' in the west coast. Unlike the classical love story, \"Camel(s)\" offers you a different taste of how a love affair can grow between two complete strangers in a black-and-white tone. The man (Lee Dae-yeon), as a chauffeur, brings the woman (Park Myung-shin) to 'Wol-got', a used-to-be village but now a small town full of motels, sashimi and karaoke bars. Having no idea of who each other is, the two middle-aged people sit in the corner of a sashimi bar and start chatting. They have dinner together.  They sing karaoke together. They head for a motel together and finally they sleep together?", "poster_path": "/30NZT3tZnyOy2YzaeLjo34p9cpL.jpg", "release_date": "2002-09-27", "title": "Camel(s)", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.4, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 0.811}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/ltbp9v8oaVNWBZTcV4s5MsvDGZ.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 10749], "id": 384127, "original_language": "ko", "original_title": "\ub0a8\uacfc \uc5ec", "overview": "Two strangers have dropped their kids off at a pickup area for a children\u2019s camp in Helsinki, Finland.
