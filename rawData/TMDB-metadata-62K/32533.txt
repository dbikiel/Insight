Teddy then rides out of the forest followed by two companions afoot, never mind that they all originally arrived afoot. Perhaps it was funnier in its day than it is now, but apparently shooting cats was regarded as funny in those days. The larger point was to use a minor whimsy as a political criticism, in this case of Teddy Roosevelt's easy manipulations of the press.

She is recording the evidence of violence and massacre that is part of South Africa's recent history. Felix Teitelbaum, who features in Kentridge's first and fourth films as the humane and loving alter-ego to the ruthless capitalist white South African psyche, appears here semi-naked and alone in a foreign hotel room, brooding over Nandi's drawings of the damaged African landscape, which cover his suitcase and walls. Kentridge has commented: 'Felix in Exile was made at the time just before the first general election in South Africa, and questioned the way in which the people who had died on the journey to this new dispensation would be remembered'.", "poster_path": "/cOftNETL8xH04axyzu1TWVmNOwx.jpg", "release_date": "1994-06-15", "title": "Felix in Exile", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.3, "vote_count": 10, "popularity": 1.858}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 154612, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Birth of Magellan: Cadenza I", "overview": "Hollis Frampton alludes to origins and creation as he cuts between a garden featuring a bride and groom and an 1902 film entitled \"A Little Piece of String.\"", "poster_path": "/hrg5cK5zh4b0tVkEfPTEfDq4Ds2.jpg", "release_date": "1977-12-31", "title": "The Birth of Magellan: Cadenza I", "video": false, "vote_average": 3.7, "vote_count": 9, "popularity": 1.821}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 148664, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Cologne: From the Diary of Ray and Esther", "overview": "An amateur documentary focused on the community of Cologne, Minnesota, circa 1939.", "poster_path": "/8U3jB21JZCK9QbzUgWNDK75Dp3I.jpg", "release_date": "1939-12-31", "title": "Cologne: From the Diary of Ray and Esther", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.3, "vote_count": 8, "popularity": 1.826}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99], "id": 231119, "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "Panorama pendant l'ascension de la Tour Eiffel", "overview": "Panorama during the ascent of the Eiffel Tower.", "poster_path": "/70JMlZlWe3r1Nz9EhaZKfGweauv.jpg", "release_date": "1898-10-29", "title": "Panorama pendant l'ascension de la Tour Eiffel", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.4, "vote_count": 9, "popularity": 1.4}], "total_pages": 2, "total_results": 40}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe44d69251416c9101e7b7", "department": "Writing", "gender": 2, "id": 109314, "job": "Writer", "name": "Don Hertzfeldt", "profile_path": "/oYbH5QOQn9RltxUJgepY94KrXs1.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "52fe44d69251416c9101e7bd", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 109314, "job": "Director", "name": "Don Hertzfeldt", "profile_path": "/oYbH5QOQn9RltxUJgepY94KrXs1.jpg"}]}}
