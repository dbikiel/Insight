Robeson committed his support to Paul Strand and Leo Hurwitz\u2019s political semidocumentary Native Land. With Robeson\u2019s narration and songs, this beautifully shot and edited film exposes violations of Americans\u2019 civil liberties and is a call to action for exploited workers around the country. Scarcely shown since its debut, Native Land represents Robeson\u2019s shift from narrative cinema to the leftist documentaries that would define the final chapter of his controversial film career.", "poster_path": "/xdI7oIeL9aYBWK60gLt9AUAXjPU.jpg", "release_date": "1942-05-11", "title": "Native Land", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.4, "vote_count": 7, "popularity": 2.374}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [16], "id": 284957, "original_language": "cs", "original_title": "Lev a p\u00edsni\u010dka", "overview": "Story of a wandering musical beggar's encounter with a hungry lion.", "poster_path": null, "release_date": "1959-01-02", "title": "The Lion and the Song", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 1.091}, {"id": 173873, "video": false, "vote_count": 5, "vote_average": 5.8, "title": "Courage for Every Day", "release_date": "1964-01-01", "original_language": "cs", "original_title": "Ka\u017ed\u00fd den odvahu", "genre_ids": [18], "backdrop_path": "/zajakx3X4HlN7yvTMumPJHLwqQg.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A passionate communist worker is discouraged by the changing political climate and the failure of his peers to live up to his ideals.", "poster_path": "/qR1Wrk7CqXb9FYtOGUL96EwCqx2.jpg", "popularity": 1.649}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/mSsE7wpvKv7hGTId9gJH2UOo4yb.jpg", "genre_ids": [28], "id": 184106, "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "Th\u00e8mes et variations", "overview": "I evoke a dancing woman.
