In the ensuing hullabaloo, Luther bites his lip and likes the taste of blood. Flash forward some thirty years and a parole board is meeting to discuss Luther's release. It seems the cheeky blighter has been murdering folk in the meantime. A dopey parole board trainee sides with the liberals and so Luther is unleashed, except now he has a special pair of customized metal teeth. Luther then proceeds to \"bite the heads off\" of many hapless folk until the tense ending. This movie is most notable for it's bare dialog, whole stretches pass without a sound. Most of the audio is composed of Luther clucking insanely like a chicken.", "poster_path": "/4SPY32uvUPPnfIbohheGcrWuw0W.jpg", "release_date": "1989-07-01", "title": "Luther the Geek", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.6, "vote_count": 12, "popularity": 4.148}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/i83Tbpb1hry1IUsVATbYYRHUyeZ.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 12], "id": 17795, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "My Fellow Americans", "overview": "They used to run the country.
