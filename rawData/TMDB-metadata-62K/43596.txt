Rouqier concentrates on a single French farm family, following them through the four seasons. As in the works of Robert Flaherty, the human characters and the land surrounding them are \"one\", and Rouqier never misses an opportunity to parallel their lives with the eons-old phases of nature. The final symbolic images of Spring, achieved through time-lapse photography, are almost unbearably beautiful. The winner of several festival awards, Farrebique nonetheless did not immediately result in an outpouring of financing for Rouqier's follow-up films (this was a common problem in the financially strapped French film industry of the 1940s). Perhaps as a result, Rouqier did not make his sequel, Biquefarre (filmed in the same region, with some of the same \"actors\"), until 1983.", "poster_path": "/rx81Dh44AxQnTtDJqrlFPptvJk5.jpg", "release_date": "1946-09-01", "title": "Farrebique, or the Four Seasons", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 1.586}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/hPIRelK4XeSgwjm3NzJHFUbT4Bz.jpg", "genre_ids": [80, 18], "id": 157319, "original_language": "qu", "original_title": "Yawar mallku", "overview": "A community reacts against a group of foreigners who under the guise of development assistance are forcibly sterilizing the peasant women.", "poster_path": "/tFuseNgAC5GaOZZwFIS7VDuN6W6.jpg", "release_date": "1969-11-20", "title": "Blood of the Condor", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.8, "vote_count": 10, "popularity": 2.073}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/tx1aZQDc0IRDKUybXo1cTQUPOll.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 10749], "id": 53522, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Movie Crazy", "overview": "After a mix-up with application photograph, an aspiring actor is invited to a test screening and goes off to Hollywood.", "poster_path": "/2uKvvKPsnOBp9rs2b2v7FZz6tms.jpg", "release_date": "1932-09-23", "title": "Movie Crazy", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 9, "popularity": 2.855}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 117591, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Traitement exp\u00e9rimental d'une h\u00e9morragie chez le chien", "overview": "Jean Painleve short about an experimental canine surgery.", "poster_path": "/cdwVC18URfEdQjjxqJyRMoGDC0H.jpg", "release_date": "1930-01-01", "title": "Experimental Treatment of a Hemorrhage in a Dog", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.4, "vote_count": 8, "popularity": 0.941}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/q4dUImrob9lDXeOdYJlVRFNoWg4.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 10751], "id": 108850, "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "La petite vendeuse de soleil", "overview": "In Dakar, selling newspapers on the street is an occupation always occupied by boys.; one morning, Sili, a young beggar, challenges that exclusive rule.", "poster_path": "/qdcNwe3xwW2e7weSgxXq6g1h11P.jpg", "release_date": "1999-02-01", "title": "The Little Girl Who Sold the Sun", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 8, "popularity": 1.499}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/pDDAfCdglMVzIWhJFep7xnUu1yG.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 51929, "original_language": "ja", "original_title": "\u3086\u304d\u3086\u304d\u3066\u3001\u795e\u8ecd", "overview": "This documentary was five years in the making, and revolves around 62-year-old Okuzaki Kenzo, a survivor of the battlefields of New Guinea in World War II who gained notoriety by slingshooting steel pinballs at Emperor Showa to protest against what he considered to be the ruler's war crimes.
