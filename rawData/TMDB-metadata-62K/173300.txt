New Orleans is the setting for Getting Back to Abnormal, a film that serves up a provocative mix of race, corruption and politics to tell the story of the re-election campaign of Stacy Head, a white woman in a city council seat traditionally held by a black representative. Supported by her irrepressible African-American aide Barbara Lacen-Keller, Head polarizes the city as her candidacy threatens to diminish the power and influence of its black citizens. Featuring a cast of characters as colorful as the city itself, the film presents a New Orleans that outsiders rarely see.", "popularity": 0.6, "poster_path": "/cHfia1ZGF6I4KnyBa8jxDTmoBsb.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2013-03-11", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 92, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Getting Back to Abnormal", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4d30c3a36847f82536c3", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1110926, "job": "Director", "name": "Louis Alvarez", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe4d30c3a36847f82536c9", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1156073, "job": "Director", "name": "Andy Kolker", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe4d30c3a36847f82536cf", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1156074, "job": "Director", "name": "Peter Odabashian", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe4d30c3a36847f82536d5", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 209975, "job": "Director", "name": "Paul Stekler", "profile_path": null}]}}
