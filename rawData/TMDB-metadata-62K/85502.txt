For generations, they have been reincarnated as mere mortals, and they won't be allowed back to heaven until they've learned to coexist in harmony. Then in today's Hong Kong, a mortuary beautician and her has-been singer dad are chased for a huge sum of money they don't owe. Turns out her materialistic stepmom has taken a tycoon's advance payment on the false promise of organizing a concert that she can't deliver. The family is therefore forced to go on the run, and along the way they meet an assortment of quirky people, including a mute baker, a kung fu cab driver, an aspiring musician and her crafty sidekick. Through a series of comic misadventures, the seven of them come to realize that they used to be gods and have a mission in this life, but...who is the eighth god that has yet to rejoin them?", "popularity": 1.96, "poster_path": "/tUnNXUI4PZ6DGhsM777H90CONZW.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "HK", "name": "Hong Kong"}], "release_date": "2011-11-24", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 100, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "cn", "name": "\u5e7f\u5dde\u8bdd / \u5ee3\u5dde\u8a71"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "East Meets West", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1003, "character": "", "credit_id": "52fe49469251416c910a81f9", "gender": 2, "id": 87621, "name": "Eason Chan", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/3KDmnth2iNtsDDW1uRbsU2QMmvL.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 1004, "character": "", "credit_id": "52fe49469251416c910a81fd", "gender": 2, "id": 21909, "name": "Ekin Cheng", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/hcWm8L0FvtiSQu7h7SkqlU82gtx.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 1005, "character": "", "credit_id": "52fe49469251416c910a8201", "gender": 1, "id": 57831, "name": "Karen Mok", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/8iLaXFGSbc54Oyn75ERt5BbPmkU.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 1006, "character": "", "credit_id": "52fe49469251416c910a8205", "gender": 2, "id": 64435, "name": "Jaycee Chan", "order": 3, "profile_path": null}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "532ef50a9251413a72003734", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 57617, "job": "Director", "name": "Jeffrey Lau", "profile_path": "/8YZWVweBpwvIik3RGQrIMulmrcF.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "532ef5119251413a7b003694", "department": "Writing", "gender": 2, "id": 57617, "job": "Writer", "name": "Jeffrey Lau", "profile_path": "/8YZWVweBpwvIik3RGQrIMulmrcF.jpg"}]}}
