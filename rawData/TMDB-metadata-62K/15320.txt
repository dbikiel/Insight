Heidi, now living in Tennessee - a married woman with kids - had always dreamt of a joyful reunion. When she ventures to Vietnam to meet her mother, she unknowingly embarks on an emotional pilgrimage that spans decades and distance. Unlike most reunion stories that climax with a clich\u00e9 happy ending, Daughter from Danang is a real-life drama. Journeying from the Vietnam War to Pulaski, Tennessee and back to Vietnam, Daughter from Danang tensely unfolds as cultural differences and the years of separation take their toll in a riveting film about longing and the personal legacy of war.", "poster_path": "/ckFeaBWzZcxUFRYnO6TCqxkzSM.jpg", "release_date": "2002-01-11", "title": "Daughter from Danang", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.3, "vote_count": 3, "popularity": 1.316}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/lC21GKccfWtPoguonQfg2ZdehwD.jpg", "genre_ids": [35], "id": 21576, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Bill Maher: Be More Cynical", "overview": "BE MORE CYNICAL was originally aired on HBO, and offers viewers a chance to see Maher's full routine, which sees him tackling a wide array of topics, and leaving the audience recoiling in laughter.", "poster_path": "/6KRxspzHMj0sg5QvqtmW7QrQZmF.jpg", "release_date": "2000-06-10", "title": "Bill Maher: Be More Cynical", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.9, "vote_count": 12, "popularity": 5.456}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/uvDYzjLIJmajTCRuepo3W6fXoFj.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 40862, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Iraq for Sale: The War Profiteers", "overview": "Documentary portraying the actions of U.S. corporate contractors in the U.S.-Iraq war.
