One night, Ihei impulsively offers to buy food and drink for the guests at a hotel; he doesn't have the money to pay, and to raise cash he concocts a scheme to take on anyone brave enough to fight him for a prize. Ihei's fighting skills impress Lord Shigeaki, who offers him a position as fencing master in his court. Ihei gratefully accepts, but when Shigeaki challenges him to a fight, Ihei beats the Lord decisively. Ihea is certain that he's managed to throw another opportunity away when a band of mercenaries attacks him, and his skills as a swordsman are put to the ultimate test.", "popularity": 4.076, "poster_path": "/i5Ux0Df3dp0GFr24EumQzWT8OoD.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 2680, "logo_path": null, "name": "Kurosawa Production Co.", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 22805, "logo_path": null, "name": "7 Films Cin\u00e9ma", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 3033, "logo_path": null, "name": "Asmik Ace", "origin_country": "JP"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}, {"iso_3166_1": "JP", "name": "Japan"}], "release_date": "1999-10-25", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 91, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ja", "name": "\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "After the Rain", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.2, "vote_count": 37, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 1462, "name": "samurai"}, {"id": 155198, "name": "ronin"}, {"id": 188181, "name": "bushido"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/7geWAyhcmjcMQWcZA5lrS7Le8cG.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 53], "id": 11878, "original_language": "ja", "original_title": "\u7528\u5fc3\u68d2", "overview": "A nameless ronin, or samurai with no master, enters a small village in feudal Japan where two rival businessmen are struggling for control of the local gambling trade.
