They hope to see a romance blossom between Nanmura and Emi, after Nanmura declares that there is something almost poetic in finding a hairpin in the bath.", "poster_path": "/yUgEmG1KHsI97FKtYwHTZP8znrD.jpg", "release_date": "1941-08-26", "title": "Ornamental Hairpin", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 2.024}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/73Dse230BnDWlEGVP1TajvYrfj3.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 10752], "id": 89226, "original_language": "ru", "original_title": "\u041d\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0435", "overview": "To the young lieutenant Maleshkin the war is a minor obstacle, if compared to his personal battle to command his subordinates, while conducting an armored vehicle at the same time he's trying to impress his superior Soviet officers who put him under extreme pressures, one after the other, fighting the German forces occupying Ukraine during World War II.
