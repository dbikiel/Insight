The strains on the men begin to show particularly in Fran\u00e7ois and Paul's friendship and in Vincent's health. A younger man, Jack, becomes attractive to Lucie, Fran\u00e7ois's wife. Another young friend, the boxer Jean, who's like a son to Vincent and whose girlfriend is pregnant, has taken a bout with a merciless slugger.
