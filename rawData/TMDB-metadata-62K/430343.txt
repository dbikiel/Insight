He repeats a prophecy on the air that he overheard backstage. He foretells that someone in the audience is doomed to everlasting solitude and that her nearest and dearest will turn their backs on her. Alex has no idea that what's been going on is no coincidence: he has become involved in a long-standing rivalry between two powerful wizards. These psychics have drawn him into a dangerous, mystical game with no rules. Strange events start to take place in the life of Tanya, the girl Alex \"cursed\" at the show. Alex tries to assure her there is no \"curse\" at all, and slowly falls in love with her. Still more signs manifest showing the prophecy is true, and it begins to threaten Tanya's life. To save himself and Tanya, Alex is forced to find a way out of this mystical mess.", "popularity": 1.95, "poster_path": "/7GyQSjzLJJQqYW2AAEwAEAbcKL2.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 84554, "logo_path": null, "name": "Kinodanz", "origin_country": "RU"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "RU", "name": "Russia"}], "release_date": "2017-01-11", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ru", "name": "P\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Mystic Game", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.0, "vote_count": 8, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 10541, "name": "curse"}, {"id": 177912, "name": "wizard"}, {"id": 236458, "name": "magician"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 37430, "video": false, "vote_count": 1122, "vote_average": 5.2, "title": "Conan the Barbarian", "release_date": "2011-08-17", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Conan the Barbarian", "genre_ids": [28, 12, 14], "backdrop_path": "/381rd4LVvy6AkSB9tqHNu81ftyR.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A quest that begins as a personal vendetta for the fierce Cimmerian warrior soon turns into an epic battle against hulking rivals, horrific monsters, and impossible odds, as Conan (Jason Momoa) realizes he is the only hope of saving the great nations of Hyboria from an encroaching reign of supernatural evil.", "poster_path": "/fQ0lcaOpn2WozSnL5hfAhH6tYOA.jpg", "popularity": 20.99}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/5SX2rgKXZ7NVmAJR5z5LprqSXKa.jpg", "genre_ids": [28, 12, 14], "id": 68735, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Warcraft", "overview": "The peaceful realm of Azeroth stands on the brink of war as its civilization faces a fearsome race of invaders: orc warriors fleeing their dying home to colonize another.
