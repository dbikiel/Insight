It is a film about the fearful heart and soul of the United States, and the 280 million Americans lucky enough to have the right to a constitutionally protected Uzi. From a look at the Columbine High School security camera tapes to the home of Oscar-winning NRA President Charlton Heston, from a young man who makes homemade napalm with The Anarchist's Cookbook to the murder of a six-year-old girl by another six-year-old. Bowling for Columbine is a journey through the US, through our past, hoping to discover why our pursuit of happiness is so riddled with violence.", "poster_path": "/eQLThQmmiCyEoGDr1MdNGYOjU0M.jpg", "release_date": "2002-10-09", "title": "Bowling for Columbine", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.6, "vote_count": 871, "popularity": 13.51}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/zZ1vpv0WA2ZG6ktpsfTwiUEglqf.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 1776, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Jesus Camp", "overview": "A growing number of Evangelical Christians believe there is a revival underway in America that requires Christian youth to assume leadership roles in advocating the causes of their religious movement.

He describes his astonishment that, at the start of the 21st century, religious faith is gaining ground in the face of rational, scientific truth. Science, based on scepticism, investigation and evidence, must continuously test its own concepts and claims. Faith, by definition, defies evidence: it is untested and unshakeable, and is therefore in direct contradiction with science.  In addition, though religions preach morality, peace and hope, in fact, says Dawkins, they bring intolerance, violence and destruction. The growth of extreme fundamentalism in so many religions across the world not only endangers humanity but, he argues, is in conflict with the trend over thousands of years of history for humanity to progress to become more enlightened and more tolerant.", "poster_path": "/tpvE6cNPNaCUZIHHtL2a0e3gpLq.jpg", "release_date": "2006-01-09", "title": "Root of All Evil?", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.7, "vote_count": 35, "popularity": 5.61}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/uMCpOzg112b2bU7ZeNNxH335JlP.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 191502, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Unbelievers", "overview": "Scientists Richard Dawkins and Lawrence Krauss travel the globe promoting a scientific worldview and the rational questioning of religious belief.", "poster_path": "/oaK3GgJDmcjPlyOUx83gmoUKA3p.jpg", "release_date": "2013-12-13", "title": "The Unbelievers", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 81, "popularity": 9.701}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/5CANN3Dl9H6053MNfuj4c4Ef4eV.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 18153, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Steal This Movie", "overview": "Five years after Yippie founder Abbie Hoffman goes underground to avoid a drug-related prison sentence, he contacts a reporter to get out the story of the FBI's covert spying, harassment and inciting of violence they then blame on the Left.", "poster_path": "/tDDZbUEy5TJ5rD5y20tMHxU7oKv.jpg", "release_date": "2000-08-18", "title": "Steal This Movie", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 17, "popularity": 5.677}, {"id": 14591, "video": true, "vote_count": 13, "vote_average": 7.5, "title": "911 in Plane Site", "release_date": "2004-01-01", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "911 in Plane Site", "genre_ids": [99], "backdrop_path": "/wwQyCccIme0rZ4xxKanUTqGB7XM.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "The public was not given all of the facts surrounding the worst terrorist attack in the United States of America's history.", "poster_path": "/7wguiNnIrYDgx6SZ7wDQhwM96d9.jpg", "popularity": 2.857}], "total_pages": 2, "total_results": 40}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe452f9251416c7504e7bb", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 74257, "job": "Director", "name": "Peter Joseph", "profile_path": "/p3XjOAXWxlufxE41xVkRZO6FWD6.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "52fe452f9251416c7504e7c1", "department": "Production", "gender": 2, "id": 74257, "job": "Producer", "name": "Peter Joseph", "profile_path": "/p3XjOAXWxlufxE41xVkRZO6FWD6.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "52fe452f9251416c7504e7c7", "department": "Writing", "gender": 2, "id": 74257, "job": "Author", "name": "Peter Joseph", "profile_path": "/p3XjOAXWxlufxE41xVkRZO6FWD6.jpg"}]}}
