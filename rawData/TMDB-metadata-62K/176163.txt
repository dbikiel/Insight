Yet, they're also completely harmless and extremely passive aggressive. Using this metaphor to address a generation that thinks big, talks fast, and threatens to change the world, Box Elder is an unapologetic portrait of a youth movement at odds with its own ambivalence, exposing a generation defined by privilege, potential, and self-induced paralysis. The film follows four best friends through their last years of college. Dependant on their parents financially, and on each other emotionally, they spend their time sleeping in, hanging out, and eating lots of sandwiches. Using break-ups and re-occurring scholastic failures to impose a quarter-life crisis, they take turns postponing responsibility, avoiding accountability, and looking for someone or something to substantiate their lives, all the while hedging their bets and mastering the art of treading water and getting away with it. It's a collegiate love letter.", "popularity": 1.053, "poster_path": "/tuhsZaTHpcpTpVcNms3DnDMp1Qe.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2008-03-08", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 95, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "The great American bromance.", "title": "Box Elder", "video": false, "vote_average": 9.0, "vote_count": 3, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4d6cc3a36847f8260273", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 1152005, "job": "Director", "name": "Todd Sklar", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe4d6cc3a36847f8260279", "department": "Writing", "gender": 2, "id": 1152005, "job": "Writer", "name": "Todd Sklar", "profile_path": null}]}}
