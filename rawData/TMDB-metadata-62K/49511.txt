It was adapted from a novella by Wenders' long-time collaborator Peter Handke. A goalkeeper is sent off during a game for committing a foul. He spends the night with a cinema cashier, whom he afterwards kills. Although a type of detective film, it is more slow moving and contemplative than other films of the genre. It explores the monotony of the murderer's existence and, like many of Wenders' films, the overwhelming cultural influence of America in post-war West Germany.", "poster_path": "/v6BgxRBOxRP7IfghuHJLYmnpE26.jpg", "popularity": 2.457}, {"id": 184795, "video": false, "vote_count": 5, "vote_average": 5.8, "title": "The Sea Gull", "release_date": "1968-12-23", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Sea Gull", "genre_ids": [18, 10749], "backdrop_path": "/FXmePnCmkh9KRpX7YGLxpCq66M.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Film adaptation of Anton Chekhov's story of life in rural Russia during the latter part of the 19th century.", "poster_path": "/xcgsWdsT3YEJR50ILMHpEF26ZIW.jpg", "popularity": 3.568}, {"id": 102256, "video": false, "vote_count": 4, "vote_average": 4.1, "title": "Marianne", "release_date": "2011-11-04", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Marianne", "genre_ids": [18, 14, 27, 9648, 53], "backdrop_path": "/en2ufDmDaydra2Zf35xCw1EAa9J.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "The life of Krister has become an unending nightmare, ever since his wife's death.
