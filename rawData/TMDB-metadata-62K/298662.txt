As a reporter interviews him in his beachfront home, Capote shares his \"self-regarding\" personality through hip philosophy and calculated jokes. He offers insights in an endearingly raspy voice about his latest book, 'In Cold Blood', which Capote declares to be part of a new genre, the \"non-fiction novel.\" Just as the Maysles brothers' direct cinema classics turn real stories into narratives, Capote's non-fiction novel makes an effort to turn reality into art. In Cold Blood is based on first-hand accounts of an actual murder. The author affectionately discusses his coverage of the subsequent trial and his intriguing relationship with the two young killers. Capote claims it is the spontaneity of life that compels him to portray reality, but it is his own fresh energy and startling sense of humor that keep us intrigued.", "popularity": 1.115, "poster_path": "/jcHSWFG0bj6qzEaDTEsTEFWzuaX.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 36025, "logo_path": null, "name": "National Educational Television Network", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1966-01-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 29, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "A Visit with Truman Capote", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 3, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 2132, "name": "literature"}, {"id": 4434, "name": "interview"}, {"id": 10818, "name": "author"}, {"id": 187056, "name": "woman director"}, {"id": 214549, "name": "short"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 326359, "video": false, "vote_count": 1180, "vote_average": 6.8, "title": "Frozen Fever", "release_date": "2015-03-09", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Frozen Fever", "genre_ids": [12, 16, 10751], "backdrop_path": "/ubioPGniCfDiASmYYpeJs5RRNaC.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "On Anna's birthday, Elsa and Kristoff are determined to give her the best celebration ever, but Elsa's icy powers may put more than just the party at risk.", "poster_path": "/lKJiVPzsAO9IJ4LKWXZ8vkR2bg4.jpg", "popularity": 17.218}, {"id": 621733, "video": false, "vote_count": 0, "vote_average": 0.0, "title": "A Trip to the Seaside", "release_date": "2019-08-30", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "A Trip to the Seaside", "genre_ids": [99], "backdrop_path": null, "adult": false, "overview": "Experimental short film on the excitement and rush of a day trip", "poster_path": "/AuZVhpoJ4jm2LWDhoJKfxQfhDAi.jpg", "popularity": 1.324}, {"id": 650755, "video": false, "vote_count": 0, "vote_average": 0.0, "title": "Atordoado, Eu Permane\u00e7o Atento", "release_date": "2020-01-15", "original_language": "pt", "original_title": "Atordoado, Eu Permane\u00e7o Atento", "genre_ids": [99], "backdrop_path": null, "adult": false, "overview": "", "poster_path": "/exbM8qk6f6T44olJXcM8ix1sunL.jpg", "popularity": 5.092}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/bQW1TnxHlmkWof0vsALj4HBkoxj.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 10749], "id": 51828, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "One Day", "overview": "A romantic comedy centered on Dexter and Emma, who first meet during their graduation in 1988 and proceed to keep in touch regularly.
