On any weekend, there may be no better place to find out what makes America great than at a flea market. A Flea Market Documentary is an unabashed celebration of the unusual people and the enticing things that can be found in parking lots, fairgrounds, drive-ins, sidewalks, and wherever else someone has posted a sign saying \"Flea Market.\"  It's capitalism mixed with craziness. It's amazing old stuff, great salespeople, the ancient tradition of the open-air market, and the possibility of finding a bargain, all uniting shoppers across the nation.  Produced by WQED Pittsburgh, A Flea Market Documentary travels from the gigantic Rose Bowl Market in Pasadena, California, to the busy but modest- sized Eastern Market in Washington, DC, talking with organizers, vendors, food merchants and shoppers.", "popularity": 1.091, "poster_path": "/oDlMedGDsohy0Eyn199d6PF37af.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 7521, "logo_path": "/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png", "name": "National Geographic", "origin_country": "US"}, {"id": 16021, "logo_path": null, "name": "WQED", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2001-07-30", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 60, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "A Flea Market Documentary", "video": true, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "5e261981b39e350017a4eb24", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 974481, "job": "Director", "name": "Rick Sebak", "profile_path": "/8eYRrrzkY9co4nza7gP0hPwQ9Tb.jpg"}]}}
