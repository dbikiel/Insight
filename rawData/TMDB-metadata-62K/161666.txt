He quickly realizes that this is not his dream situation: the winter is harsher than he's ever experienced, he's living in the basement of the school, the older of his students treat him poorly and his wages are paltry if and when he ever does get paid. He also feels physically and emotionally isolated. There, he bonds primarily with two townsfolk. Harris Montgomery sees Max as an obvious choice to espouse the politics of socialism. And Alice Field sees in Max a person like herself: being a British war bride, she is an alien in a harsh environment. Alice is in an unsatisfying marriage and turns to Max for emotional support. As Max goes through his first year in Willowgreen, he learns to understand life in a rural prairie town, both from the viewpoint of his students and for his own benefit.", "popularity": 2.411, "poster_path": "/5JkkIFJwFWMqHMNRn7tgYNLLlEN.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 56321, "logo_path": null, "name": "Lancer Productions Limited", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 56819, "logo_path": null, "name": "Fraser Films", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 4952, "logo_path": null, "name": "Canadian Film Development Corporation (CFDC)", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 36555, "logo_path": null, "name": "Famous Players", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CA", "name": "Canada"}], "release_date": "1977-06-23", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 100, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "\"Everything is funny, as long as it's happening to someone else!\"", "title": "Why Shoot the Teacher?", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.3, "vote_count": 2, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 1533, "name": "isolation"}, {"id": 2519, "name": "canadian"}, {"id": 5571, "name": "great depression"}, {"id": 9930, "name": "prairie"}, {"id": 10508, "name": "teacher"}, {"id": 172228, "name": "schoolhouse"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 52449, "video": false, "vote_count": 3175, "vote_average": 5.5, "title": "Bad Teacher", "release_date": "2011-05-16", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Bad Teacher", "genre_ids": [35], "backdrop_path": "/vmgRzmRMPjhZ50Oai1DI0LLEZCo.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A lazy, incompetent middle school teacher who hates her job and her students is forced to return to her job to make enough money for a boob job after her rich fianc\u00e9 dumps her.", "poster_path": "/zpIY4qUSX91J9XpPgr0hFrk1eKr.jpg", "popularity": 15.441}, {"id": 233063, "video": false, "vote_count": 1166, "vote_average": 7.1, "title": "Suck Me Shakespeer", "release_date": "2013-11-07", "original_language": "de", "original_title": "Fack ju G\u00f6hte", "genre_ids": [35], "backdrop_path": "/AtCGEku6kLUFmZ6JWkvXphQBQXx.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A comedy that follows an ex-con who lands a position at a school that sits over the spot where money from one of his earlier robberies was stashed.", "poster_path": "/9GSGg4McYID6Ld0OMwimLr1Zx4J.jpg", "popularity": 15.749}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/AqocxdL9luA7ALU0gGSHDzDy254.jpg", "genre_ids": [14, 16, 18, 878], "id": 14069, "original_language": "ja", "original_title": "\u6642\u3092\u304b\u3051\u308b\u5c11\u5973", "overview": "When 17-year-old Makoto Konno gains the ability to, quite literally, \"leap\" backwards through time, she immediately sets about improving her grades and preventing personal mishaps.
