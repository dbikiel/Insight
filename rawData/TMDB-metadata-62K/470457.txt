As a young ambitious missionary three decades ago, Dan, a red-bearded towering American, decamped to the Amazon rain forest to save indigenous souls. His assignment was to translate the book of Mark into the tongue of the Pirah, a people whose puzzling speech seemed unrelated to any other on Earth. What he learned during his time with the Pirah led him to question the very foundations of his own deep beliefs. As a 'born again' atheist, Dan divorced his devout Christian wife and became estranged from his children. Having lost faith and family, his new life is dominated by the desire to leave behind his legacy. Everett's most controversial claim is that the Pirah language lacks 'recursion' - the ability to build an infinite number of sentences.", "popularity": 1.004, "poster_path": null, "production_companies": [{"id": 6747, "logo_path": "/uLTkpA3dpMrGwBIDin8OByW39gQ.png", "name": "Essential Media and Entertainment", "origin_country": "AU"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "AU", "name": "Australia"}], "release_date": "2012-01-25", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 52, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Grammar of Happiness", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 220414, "name": "linguistics"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 63579, "video": false, "vote_count": 87, "vote_average": 6.9, "title": "Project Nim", "release_date": "2011-07-08", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Project Nim", "genre_ids": [99], "backdrop_path": "/ue0Ad8Mz2GhRMTS9H2pX61K96eu.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "From the team behind Man on Wire comes the story of Nim, the chimpanzee who in the 1970s became the focus of a landmark experiment which aimed to show that an ape could learn to communicate with language if raised and nurtured like a human child.
