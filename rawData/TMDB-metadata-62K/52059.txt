The film reveals how the hard-liners within the government marginalized moderates among the protesters (including students, workers and intellectuals), while the actions of radical protesters undermined moderates in the government. Moderate voices were gradually cowed and then silenced by extremism and emotionalism on both sides.", "popularity": 0.6, "poster_path": "/h5pKvDcSJSTGBV83uk3yhWjX23X.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1995-01-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 180, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Gate of Heavenly Peace", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.4, "vote_count": 5, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4816c3a36847f8157779", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 240366, "job": "Director", "name": "Carma Hinton", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe4816c3a36847f815777f", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 30811, "job": "Director", "name": "Richard Gordon", "profile_path": null}]}}
