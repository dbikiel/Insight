He feels victimized enough, both for the prison time and for the crime which led to it; he committed the crime to give his wife the nice things she asked him for. When he discovers that she has remarried a quite wealthy man, he is outraged. However, his ire is not due to her disloyalty to him; he loved their only son to distraction, and now the boy has no knowledge or memory of him.", "popularity": 1.4, "poster_path": "/aDqSAmz2jXdR6HIIHTkLtp4do7k.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1974-02-06", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 83, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Le p\u00e9lican", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 2, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "53b4aec30e0a2676cf0008a8", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 24298, "job": "Director", "name": "G\u00e9rard Blain", "profile_path": "/pPYuPqx8NrieLkNpZhUKej5s3tx.jpg"}]}}
