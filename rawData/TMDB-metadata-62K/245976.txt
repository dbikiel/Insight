He and his wife, Agatha, have been separated for 15 years, but he promises to give their daughter, Joyce, a lavish wedding at his \"ch\u00e2teau\" in France. The fact that he doesn't have a ch\u00e2teau in France is just a minor trifle. He induces the caretaker, Bill Cherau, of a large country estate to allow it to be used for the wedding. The wedding party arrives and Bill falls madly in love with Joyce and she with him, but a gal has gotta do what a gal has gotta do, and her intended marriage to stuffed-shirt Horace Miller stays on the books. But Steward has a change of heart and he tells one and all that he and his friends, Von Gersdorff, Lefevre, Iznamof, Clifton Summitt and Sasch, are all frauds and crooks. Horace and his family stalk out, which is just fine with Joyce as her true love, the caretaker, is waiting on the grounds.", "popularity": 2.05, "poster_path": "/v68qOU7qfaMSTldrwsbZyLOZMs4.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 21, "logo_path": "/mjofSXiHpG5t6KYmU4l4FrUhT7m.png", "name": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "origin_country": "US"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1937-12-03", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 72, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "A Laugh-A-Minute romance!", "title": "Beg, Borrow or Steal", "video": false, "vote_average": 3.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 3202, "name": "con man"}, {"id": 9813, "name": "french riviera"}, {"id": 13027, "name": "wedding"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/wyvHy4ElaiNamrpS6fjquYQqxhQ.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 18, 10749], "id": 712, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Four Weddings and a Funeral", "overview": "Over the course of five social occasions, a committed bachelor must consider the notion that he may have discovered love.", "poster_path": "/md9kMKnLG8LG4pMDM98gy5x4K5L.jpg", "release_date": "1994-03-09", "title": "Four Weddings and a Funeral", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.7, "vote_count": 1456, "popularity": 16.541}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/gRY30dvyLhydkblpE0v3NiXt0Nj.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 10749], "id": 6557, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "27 Dresses", "overview": "Altruistic Jane finds herself facing her worst nightmare as her younger sister announces her engagement to the man Jane secretly adores.", "poster_path": "/zzJtHNzi1D4CPwRlPHV1TRQNXD2.jpg", "release_date": "2008-01-10", "title": "27 Dresses", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.3, "vote_count": 2136, "popularity": 10.851}, {"id": 10141, "video": false, "vote_count": 414, "vote_average": 7.1, "title": "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels", "release_date": "1988-12-14", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels", "genre_ids": [35, 80], "backdrop_path": "/coemYANmOCtpXE98qdXzQ0uqqG5.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Two con men try to settle their rivalry by betting on who can be the first to swindle a young American heiress out of $50,000.", "poster_path": "/fdwW9gwi50lmgPyv2teT2NCjElO.jpg", "popularity": 15.8}, {"id": 2959, "video": false, "vote_count": 567, "vote_average": 5.6, "title": "License to Wed", "release_date": "2007-07-04", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "License to Wed", "genre_ids": [35], "backdrop_path": "/tdWTbuP08jRS08XuNkBBCgKNR1B.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Newly engaged, Ben and Sadie can't wait to start their life together and live happily ever after.
