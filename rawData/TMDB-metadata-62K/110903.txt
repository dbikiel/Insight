Despite his betrothal to a beautiful and timid young woman of high birth, his libido turns to his many female models. Despite this freedom from constraint, his lust and artistic sentiment cause him nothing but an increasing awareness of the elusive embodiment of true Beauty. While traveling he encounters a mesmerizing widow who relentlessly searches for her husband's body in the nearby lake, believing him killed at the hands of a ferocious roaming bandit. Infatuated with her beauty, he feigns to help her look for the corpse, only to unlock the mystery himself thereby sending him to further depths of debauchery and despair. This is the third and final film in director Suzuki Seijun's critically acclaimed Taisho Trilogy.", "popularity": 2.433, "poster_path": "/w4526VI2ZRAVYG9Sqd1bhhBpBbk.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "JP", "name": "Japan"}], "release_date": "1991-05-31", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 128, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ja", "name": "\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Yumeji", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 11, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 110901, "video": false, "vote_count": 12, "vote_average": 7.3, "title": "Kagero-za", "release_date": "1981-08-21", "original_language": "ja", "original_title": "\u967d\u708e\u5ea7", "genre_ids": [14, 27, 9648, 53], "backdrop_path": null, "adult": false, "overview": "A 1920s playwright meets a beautiful woman who may be the ghost of his patron's deceased wife.", "poster_path": "/1c6hnPIm4TF6kM7Qr0JMvqZgmLN.jpg", "popularity": 3.243}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/7RZOhsY03PhakmYFI2LhctFqTVN.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 27, 53, 9648, 10749], "id": 110899, "original_language": "ja", "original_title": "\u30c4\u30a3\u30b4\u30a4\u30cd\u30eb\u30ef\u30a4\u30bc\u30f3", "overview": "A surreal period film following an university professor and his eerie nomad friend as they go through loose romantic triangles and face death in peculiar ways.", "poster_path": "/4WMsTxkFrlfIswI7z5Pm71NZJSF.jpg", "release_date": "1980-04-01", "title": "Zigeunerweisen", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.8, "vote_count": 19, "popularity": 2.147}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/qumhydiYZgdX6Cww7bOMwZTKYNC.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 148355, "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "La villa Santo Sospir", "overview": "A 35-minute color film by Cocteau entitled \"La Villa Santo Sospir.\" Shot in 1952, this is an \"amateur film\" done in 16mm, a sort of home movie in which Cocteau takes the viewer on a tour of a friend's villa on the French coast (a major location used in Testament of Orpheus). The house itself is heavily decorated, mostly by Cocteau (and a bit by Picasso), and we are given an extensive tour of the artwork. Cocteau also shows us several dozen paintings as well. Most cover mythological themes, of course. He also proudly shows paintings by Edouard Dermithe and Jean Marais and plays around his own home in Villefranche. This informal little project once again shows the joy Cocteau takes in creating art, in addition to showing a side of his work (his paintings and drawings) that his films often overshadow.", "poster_path": "/n2LKAz18YwTbb5d0DmY8BZxtWQ4.jpg", "release_date": "1952-12-05", "title": "La Villa Santo Sospir", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.6, "vote_count": 7, "popularity": 1.627}, {"id": 418833, "video": false, "vote_count": 6, "vote_average": 7.7, "title": "Top Knot Detective", "release_date": "2017-04-01", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Top Knot Detective", "genre_ids": [28, 35, 80, 18, 36, 9648], "backdrop_path": "/5I52dB1oPSK8Dq3FknhLYKKt35m.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "In the early 1990s, a Japanese samurai detective series was aired in Australia and became a cult success.
