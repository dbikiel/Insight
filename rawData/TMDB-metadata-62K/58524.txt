When World War Two breaks out, Gracie sings for the troops despite poor health, to the dismay of her fussy husband, film director Monty Banks, an Italian, born Mario Bianchi. With Italy's entry into the war Monty is in danger of being interned so Gracie consents to his moving to America whilst she tours Canada, fund-raising for the war effort. She is accused of deserting the country which made her famous and booed offstage, though she later tours battlefields as a singer. With the war over she regains popularity, performing 'Take Me To Your Heart Again' at the London Palladium. Banks dies in 1950 and, though still a successful singer, Gracie never regains her pre-war iconic status.", "popularity": 0.977, "poster_path": "/1rBSSKLpiJYKGucCVdtPu3wX0ty.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 3324, "logo_path": "/16fY7pucCzn7WSOYxOGRHlAayL3.png", "name": "BBC", "origin_country": "GB"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "2009-11-23", "revenue": 0, "runtime": null, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Gracie!", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.5, "vote_count": 2, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 5565, "name": "biography"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/nU6DDTabbMkd3649WYtSiOdHCMC.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 10749], "id": 332283, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Mary Shelley", "overview": "The love affair between poet Percy Shelley and Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin resulted in the creation of an immortal novel, \u201cFrankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus.\u201d", "poster_path": "/gKHJTsrfxJtfFNPQJn2hDNEMtFf.jpg", "release_date": "2018-04-22", "title": "Mary Shelley", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.1, "vote_count": 516, "popularity": 12.227}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/mYKP6qcDUimVMAHQWLOuDHjO19S.jpg", "genre_ids": [35], "id": 445629, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Fighting with My Family", "overview": "Born into a tight-knit wrestling family, Paige and her brother Zak are ecstatic when they get the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to try out for the WWE.
