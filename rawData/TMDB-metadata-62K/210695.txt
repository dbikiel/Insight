The play was included in the First Folio, published in 1623. Much Ado About Nothing is generally considered one of Shakespeare\u2019s best comedies, because it combines elements of robust hilarity with more serious meditations on honor, shame, and court politics. Like As You Like It and Twelfth Night, Much Ado About Nothing, though interspersed with darker concerns, is a joyful comedy that ends with multiple marriages and no deaths.
