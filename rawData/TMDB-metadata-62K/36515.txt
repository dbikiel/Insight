While investigating the violent killing, Mesa, Arizona police retrieved a digital camera from Alexander\u2019s washing machine, revealing shocking images authorities claim Arias took during their sexual escapades, as well as during and after his murder. While Jodi pled not guilty and contends she killed Alexander in self-defense, police concluded that when he broke off their relationship, she stalked her ex-boyfriend and seduced him one final time before murdering him in cold blood. Her subsequent trial has been grand theater, dominating the cable news networks as she testified in her own defense and offered explicit insight into the sex, lies and obsession that led up to Alexander\u2019s murder.", "poster_path": "/jm8uadhRgQg9UBPrnC5Q8LdIMRJ.jpg", "release_date": "2013-06-22", "title": "Jodi Arias: Dirty Little Secret", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.1, "vote_count": 23, "popularity": 6.55}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/46D1tEjUC9PSr8NVbB2rWBfQTtu.jpg", "genre_ids": [10749, 18], "id": 48798, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Love and Distrust", "overview": "This collection of five short films artfully portrays desire's ability to both empower and destroy those who encounter it.", "poster_path": "/it22C6LNuwd4ktP8oDJECdJxxS3.jpg", "release_date": "2010-08-16", "title": "Love and Distrust", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.7, "vote_count": 16, "popularity": 3.891}, {"id": 238018, "video": false, "vote_count": 25, "vote_average": 6.2, "title": "The Christmas Ornament", "release_date": "2013-11-16", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Christmas Ornament", "genre_ids": [10749, 10770], "backdrop_path": "/cLYdRjM3Y7VhL3WsQGgOaur1dnx.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Newly widowed Kathy plans to skip out on decking the halls and trimming the tree this Christmas, trying to avoid anything that will bring back memories of her late husband.
