Center stage of the film takes not only the music, but first of all the attitude to life of the young musicians who deny consumerism and pressure to perform well. The Berlin filmmakers Susanne Messmer and George Lindt go on a ramble through the musical underground of Beijing and thereby meet people, who give them naturally and spontaneously an up-front insight in their daily live. Kind of a video diary it gives insight in a counter culture hardly anyone would assume in an authoritarian state like the People's Republic of China.", "popularity": 0.6, "poster_path": "/1TeY23wCJa5jGnPifzx5JCUzCYo.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 70753, "logo_path": null, "name": "Lieblingslied Records", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}], "release_date": "2006-03-14", "revenue": 0, "runtime": null, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "zh", "name": "\u666e\u901a\u8bdd"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "Beijing Bubbles is a portrait of the punk and rock scene in Beijing, which as a subculture is barely recognized there", "title": "Beijing Bubbles", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "567d0b2492514132db003b95", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1553421, "job": "Director", "name": "George Lindt", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "567d0b37c3a3684be30062f1", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1553422, "job": "Director", "name": "Susanne Messmer", "profile_path": null}]}}
