In 1998, The Tacoma Narrows Bridge Collapse was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant. This footage is still shown to engineering, architecture, and physics students as a cautionary tale.Elliott's original films of the construction and collapse of the bridge were shot on 16 mm Kodachrome film, but most copies in circulation are in black and white because newsreels of the day copied the film onto 35 mm black-and-white stock. Most copies in circulation also show the bridge oscillating approximately 50% faster than real time, due to an assumption during conversion that the film was shot at 24 frames per second rather than the actual 16 fps.

The camera zooms in into the boy's mind and a slow, sad waltz (i.e.\"Valse Triste\") accompanies images of a locomotive, a miner, the globe, the sky, a sheep heard, etc. Disparate elements, but if one concentrates only at the movement of the figures, one can perceive a commotion, slowly livening up: The starting wheels of the heavy locomotive, the tired miner pushing the heavy cart of coal bricks, the globe smoothly turning around and around, the clouds imperceptibly floating in the sky, the sheep idly moving in the herd, etc.  We reach the first climax when a mannequin opens her coat like a flower. The second big crescendo spurts out from a \"water hose\", after watching schoolgirls doing gymnastics for quite a while. A sad, but nostalgic aftertaste lingers in the end when funeral cars drive away through a flooded area\u2026", "poster_path": "/fsLJMk1dPfzr5qXd3IRSmZRxpX6.jpg", "release_date": "1977-06-01", "title": "Valse Triste", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 9, "popularity": 2.331}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 163085, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Jam Session", "overview": "Duke Ellington and Orchestra perform 'C Jam Blues'.", "poster_path": "/j2Y7rsDvh1mYwDpVLcCco9dQA8v.jpg", "release_date": "1942-01-01", "title": "Jam Session", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 10, "popularity": 1.278}], "total_pages": 2, "total_results": 40}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 4, "character": "Dje\u010dak", "credit_id": "562aa05a925141284c002e42", "gender": 0, "id": 1196554, "name": "Almedin Leleta", "order": 1, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Turista", "credit_id": "562aa0679251414ad8001283", "gender": 0, "id": 1526119, "name": "Satoshi Yahata", "order": 2, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 6, "character": "Prodavac", "credit_id": "562aa074925141284c002e4b", "gender": 0, "id": 1526120, "name": "Milan Pavlovi\u0107", "order": 3, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 7, "character": "Majka", "credit_id": "562aa0809251412857002cc1", "gender": 0, "id": 559493, "name": "Jasna \u017dalica", "order": 4, "profile_path": "/49ZS5vmDuyTDghlXLnlIIscQ9Lk.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 8, "character": "Otac", "credit_id": "562aa08ac3a3681b5c002bd9", "gender": 0, "id": 1334946, "name": "Izudin Bajrovi\u0107", "order": 5, "profile_path": "/s5OWdV8e5Csr2XYEARzwq2ThDZC.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 9, "character": "Atko", "credit_id": "562aa094c3a3681b5e002c6f", "gender": 0, "id": 1346388, "name": "Admir Glamo\u010dak", "order": 6, "profile_path": "/ttcSPPfNw1xwlOmD10o28JbbFZU.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 10, "character": "Vojnik 1", "credit_id": "562aa09f925141284c002e5d", "gender": 0, "id": 110960, "name": "Enis Be\u0161lagi\u0107", "order": 7, "profile_path": "/7yns1DWrIdw4TGjPBmF2OOiCl3y.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 11, "character": "Vojnik 2", "credit_id": "562aa0ac9251412853002da1", "gender": 0, "id": 1526121, "name": "Elmir Juki\u0107", "order": 8, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 12, "character": "Sanja", "credit_id": "562aa0bac3a3681b61002ee8", "gender": 0, "id": 1334945, "name": "Sanja Buri\u0107", "order": 9, "profile_path": null}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4be0c3a36847f8217859", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1040466, "job": "Director", "name": "Ahmed Imamovi\u0107", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe4be0c3a36847f821785f", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 1030481, "job": "Writer", "name": "Sr\u0111an Vuleti\u0107", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe4be0c3a36847f8217865", "department": "Crew", "gender": 0, "id": 1068335, "job": "Cinematography", "name": "Mirsad Herovi\u0107", "profile_path": null}]}}
