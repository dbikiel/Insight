Rouqier concentrates on a single French farm family, following them through the four seasons.

The final symbolic images of Spring, achieved through time-lapse photography, are almost unbearably beautiful. The winner of several festival awards, Farrebique nonetheless did not immediately result in an outpouring of financing for Rouqier's follow-up films (this was a common problem in the financially strapped French film industry of the 1940s). Perhaps as a result, Rouqier did not make his sequel, Biquefarre (filmed in the same region, with some of the same \"actors\"), until 1983.", "poster_path": "/rx81Dh44AxQnTtDJqrlFPptvJk5.jpg", "release_date": "1946-09-01", "title": "Farrebique, or the Four Seasons", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 1.586}, {"id": 185579, "video": false, "vote_count": 11, "vote_average": 8.3, "title": "A Sixth Part of the World", "release_date": "1926-12-31", "original_language": "ru", "original_title": "\u0428\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u044f \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430", "genre_ids": [99], "backdrop_path": "/nLlI0t36cvtHz5KMeLraLYmZ6OO.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Through the travelogue format, it depicts the multitude of Soviet peoples in remote areas of USSR and details the entirety of the wealth of the Soviet land.
