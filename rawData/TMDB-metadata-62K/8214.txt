Rouqier concentrates on a single French farm family, following them through the four seasons.

The final symbolic images of Spring, achieved through time-lapse photography, are almost unbearably beautiful. The winner of several festival awards, Farrebique nonetheless did not immediately result in an outpouring of financing for Rouqier's follow-up films (this was a common problem in the financially strapped French film industry of the 1940s). Perhaps as a result, Rouqier did not make his sequel, Biquefarre (filmed in the same region, with some of the same \"actors\"), until 1983.", "poster_path": "/rx81Dh44AxQnTtDJqrlFPptvJk5.jpg", "release_date": "1946-09-01", "title": "Farrebique, or the Four Seasons", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 1.586}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 189076, "original_language": "fi", "original_title": "Kuningasj\u00e4tk\u00e4", "overview": "Topi's mother, who is also Tenho's wife dies and Tenho and Topi have to move out from the town because they don't have enough money to pay their rent.
