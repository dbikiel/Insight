Sammo Hung is a retired cop who trains assassins to do the jobs of cops, whom Sammo sees as unable to do the right things. He sends his four students to assassinate drug dealers. They more than complete the job when they kill one of Sammo's old time buddies, played by TVB veteran Sek Sau. These young fellows have only been taught one thing: to kill. They have not been taught WHO to kill. Obviously, that creates some problems as they kill good and bad people.", "popularity": 0.961, "poster_path": "/fsPghi7cZQTeRUPxA8RotdKjBJE.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2002-01-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 88, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "cn", "name": "\u5e7f\u5dde\u8bdd / \u5ee3\u5dde\u8a71"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Hidden Enforcers", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 5, "character": "King", "credit_id": "52fe4918c3a368484e119c89", "gender": 2, "id": 62410, "name": "Sammo Hung", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/hpqwIMmLLpn0mMmpi4EhzARK24K.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 6, "character": "", "credit_id": "576e7a0ec3a36811eb00044d", "gender": 1, "id": 1595682, "name": "Bessie Chan", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/yzHApQDbwAvV57jbMXYMFJqKez9.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "", "credit_id": "52fe4918c3a368484e119c81", "gender": 1, "id": 576426, "name": "Nadia Chan", "order": 2, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "", "credit_id": "52fe4918c3a368484e119c85", "gender": 0, "id": 576427, "name": "Cheng Chu-Fung", "order": 3, "profile_path": null}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4918c3a368484e119c79", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 301314, "job": "Director", "name": "Nam Yin", "profile_path": "/lv71MBo1btnOnOF7rUEDWplzv8s.jpg"}]}}
