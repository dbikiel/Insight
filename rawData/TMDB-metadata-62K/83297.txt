Completed by former punk musician Ishii for his film course graduation from Japan University in Tokyo, this raw-edged biker flick is a tour-de-force of automotive auto-eroticism. Originally shot on 16mm, Toei were so impressed by this violent counter-cultural kick-back against the anodyne fluff that typified early 80s cinema that they blew it up to 35mm for theatrical distribution.", "popularity": 1.637, "poster_path": "/pvreV9mywej4GBrp7mLcLZVejvL.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "JP", "name": "Japan"}], "release_date": "1980-05-24", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 98, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ja", "name": "\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Crazy Thunder Road", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 7, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/1w8oTrWwfXt6CTJx3KqieaAOu35.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 8935, "original_language": "zh", "original_title": "\u505c\u8eca", "overview": "On Mother's Day in Taipei, Chen Mo makes a date for dinner with his wife, hoping to bring their estranged relationship back together.
