Driven by a commitment to bear witness to the wars of our time after the events of 9/11, Chris was among the first in a new generation of war photographers since Vietnam. HONDROS explores the complexities inherent in covering more than a decade of conflict, while trying to maintain a normal life. It also examines the unknowable calculus involved in making split-second life and death decisions -- before, during and after his photos were made. Chris was killed in Libya in 2011, but he left a lasting impact on his profession that is still felt today.", "poster_path": "/eRk9EmZY93TAvBWu5wWz534ISYP.jpg", "release_date": "2018-03-02", "title": "Hondros", "video": false, "vote_average": 8.1, "vote_count": 9, "popularity": 4.292}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/xAWvfFG4hK4wGywiapWYE5wfF1O.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 262436, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Champs", "overview": "A documentary about the sport of boxing, as seen through the eyes of champions Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield and Bernard Hopkins.", "poster_path": "/uHUvmvNBRHJpoG3QUHZC1Sk9pfd.jpg", "release_date": "2015-03-13", "title": "Champs", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.8, "vote_count": 25, "popularity": 4.562}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/5oJb47JNlvU1p0PDA55vr3Nhpr.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 502298, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Liberated: The New Sexual Revolution", "overview": "A documentary about today's young adult hookup culture and the stories in pop-culture that influence it.", "poster_path": "/kmsT3BEmUgZMvFBKYO69ajiDZJR.jpg", "release_date": "2017-04-22", "title": "Liberated: The New Sexual Revolution", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.7, "vote_count": 18, "popularity": 3.185}, {"id": 461234, "video": false, "vote_count": 21, "vote_average": 6.3, "title": "Survivor's Guide to Prison", "release_date": "2018-02-23", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Survivor's Guide to Prison", "genre_ids": [99], "backdrop_path": "/74vF474FSOLtecWak7SjA1CAmNW.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Today, you're more likely to go to prison in the United States than anywhere else in the world.

We were able to bring Rohani\u2019s past experiences to life by working closely with his family and friends in the village where he grew up. These are the people you see representing Rohani in the film at various stages in his life. Story telling is a big part of Bajau culture, and a way of preserving traditions through generations, so everyone was very enthusiastic about what we were trying to do and brought lots of ideas of their own, especially Rohani. Although he had never had a camera pointed at him, it certainly wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d sat around telling stories.
