He gets away one day, and the world is all before him: where should he go, what should he do? Should he try to find his mom? Should he head for Colorado, where he's daydreamed about life in the woods. He has a younger brother, so under cover of night, Ryan visits him. At night, Ryan is on the streets where there are other youth at loose ends, including one who wants Ryan to help with a burglary. The police are looking for him as well. Where might a 16-year-old of limited experience, with no money, imagine he could be safe?", "popularity": 0.6, "poster_path": "/pjFdc9K7huhIMmCXdA7PxHGBTZt.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1998-09-11", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 80, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Trans", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 2, "character": "Ryan Kazinski", "credit_id": "52fe4a3fc3a36847f81c3477", "gender": 0, "id": 1037305, "name": "Ryan Daugherty", "order": 0, "profile_path": null}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4a3fc3a36847f81c3473", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 543550, "job": "Director", "name": "Julian Goldberger", "profile_path": null}]}}
