Nothing for Tom, but at Jerry's box, Tom finds a package; inside is a book, \"Life with Tom\" by Jerry Mouse. As Tom flips to chapters and hears, first a radio audience, then a group of alley cats, then Spike and Tyke, all laughing over the book, we see the clips from earlier shows that everyone is laughing at. Tom gets more and more irate about being the butt of everyone's jokes, and confronts Jerry, clobbering him with the book, when Jerry shows Tom the rest of his mail. The royalty checks have come in, and Jerry has split his $50,000 royalty with Tom. Suddenly, with $25,000 in his pocket, Tom is able to find the book funny.", "poster_path": "/1txQIeIWEQbTm0VlpJJiKnQApqk.jpg", "popularity": 2.338}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [53, 28, 12], "id": 31123, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Red Zone Cuba", "overview": "Gritty neo-noir art film about escaped convict Griffin and his friends, who ran all the way to hell... with a penny, and a broken cigarette.", "poster_path": "/w1K5qJXMjkbU5i3SdNGxsYfTjGb.jpg", "release_date": "1966-11-01", "title": "Red Zone Cuba", "video": false, "vote_average": 1.5, "vote_count": 15, "popularity": 2.845}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/aFILbZE0o2Tg0lgx8cKU7Y3IMhP.jpg", "genre_ids": [27], "id": 28586, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Tormented", "overview": "A jazz pianist is haunted by his dead ex-lover's crawling hand and floating head.", "poster_path": "/uFikEfs32RCnBjwioCiUVQUcVJe.jpg", "release_date": "1960-09-22", "title": "Tormented", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.8, "vote_count": 17, "popularity": 4.72}, {"id": 27625, "video": false, "vote_count": 20, "vote_average": 4.6, "title": "It Conquered the World", "release_date": "1956-07-14", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "It Conquered the World", "genre_ids": [27, 878, 53], "backdrop_path": "/uyvuz1wjHiv1xchdJBB1Ujh6202.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "An alien from Venus tries to take over the world with the help of a disillusioned human scientist.", "poster_path": "/2V56EhYR3VsiXnnEMdWWPMsWO68.jpg", "popularity": 4.772}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/ycY9c5DZgiM4ZK0eb8fR4YSj3w2.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 80], "id": 89751, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Beatniks", "overview": "A young singer's chance at fame is threatened by his hoodlum pals.", "poster_path": "/okFNLh5poZBGhQ3mi0aR2tT7VLn.jpg", "release_date": "1960-01-01", "title": "The Beatniks", "video": false, "vote_average": 2.7, "vote_count": 10, "popularity": 3.308}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [18], "id": 31282, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "I Accuse My Parents", "overview": "Ignored by his alcoholic parents, Jimmy Wilson starts hanging around with some shady characters.
