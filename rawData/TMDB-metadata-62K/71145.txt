To compensate, Pooh declares they shall have an unfrightening \"Hallo-Wasn't\" for Piglet's sake, much to Tigger's dismay. However, when Pooh, Eeyore, and Tigger arrive at Piglet's house later in the evening dressed as \"Spookables\", Piglet mistakes them for actual Spookables and flees into the night to warn his friends; seeing the Piglet-shaped hole Piglet made in the wall in his panic to escape, the three believe Piglet to have been captured by Spookables himself, and set off to rescue their friend.", "popularity": 1.813, "poster_path": "/IEG2mmTL6qQg8nuoWSnQQEHx5n.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1996-01-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 21, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "A haunting tale from the Hundred Acre Wood!", "title": "Boo to You Too!
