The shady character who was playing the game before him covets the lamp, and tries to steal it. Egghead sees a poster: The sultan is having a contest for his daughter's hand in marriage. With his lamp, Egghead thinks he's a sure bet; he conjures up a magic carpet, and he's off. After a couple bad vaudeville acts, it's Egghead's turn, but in the meantime, the bad guy swapped the lamp for a coffeepot. Egghead is thrown out, then sees the bad guy using the lamp; Egghead breaks in, steals the lamp and the girl, and flies off. But she uses the lamp herself to conjure up a real hunk to replace the nerdy Egghead.", "popularity": 0.691, "poster_path": "/2dKOVd0qkHAFReSBpDL1yimCo15.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1938-08-26", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 8, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "A-Lad-In Bagdad", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.5, "vote_count": 2, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4d34c3a368484e1dcbc3", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 573539, "job": "Director", "name": "Cal Dalton", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe4d34c3a368484e1dcbc9", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 785866, "job": "Director", "name": "Cal Howard", "profile_path": null}]}}
