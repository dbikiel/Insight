Many of the key figures had remained silent. No-one had been to Argentina to tell the other side of the story. For the majority of the British people, the war was another glorious chapter in their history. With flags waving and bands playing, British troops had sailed away to repel the invaders. Patriotic emotions were stirred as they returned victorious. Government MPs tried to get the film banned, but Yorkshire TV's telephones were jammed with messages of support from wives and mothers of those who died in the conflict. Called 'the documentary to end all documentaries about the Falklands War' in the British press, it was also described as 'more poem than polemic - a hymn against war'.", "popularity": 0.6, "poster_path": "/2raZUncjFatKv2YFBe35SGh8x2Y.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 52, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Falklands War: The Untold Story", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": []}}
