Grant stars for the first time in color in this fanciful biopic. Alexis Smith plays Linda, whose serendipitous meetings with Cole lead to a meeting at the alter. More than 20 Porter songs grace this tail of triumph and tragedy, with Grand lending is amiable voice to \"You're the Top\", \"Night and Day\" and more. Monty Wooley, a Yale contemporary of Porter, portrays himself. And Jane Wyman, Mary Martin, Eve Arden and others provide vocals and verve. Lights down. Curtain up. Standards embraced by generations are yours to enjoy in \"Night and Day.\"", "poster_path": "/mrlKsBUxPwxGr8M8xupI96qrA8j.jpg", "popularity": 2.851}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/9HfMeUuVKWfrgqpIucbjhppHp3V.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 10770], "id": 8664, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Rough Air: Danger on Flight 534", "overview": "Having taken the blame for an accident beyond his control, pilot Mike Hogan has been on administrative leave indefinitely; however when the airline is desperately short of staff, he is offered to be first officer and accepts, without enthusiasm, received with disdain by the well-connected commander.
