They are sharing a flat in an old building close to Berlin Central Station. The area is one of the city's last remaining gaps between buildings. They decide to end their flat share as soon as the first trenches will be dug. With mixed feelings they are heading towards the time when their spontaneous life comes to an end, which means they have to make one or more (life) decisions eventually. The current flat is a symbol for their own life scripts so far: unformed and all bets are off but it already starts to be uncomfortable. They spend the remaining days in their flat with friends, celebrations, discussions and the strong feeling for the dawning of a new era.", "popularity": 0.723, "poster_path": "/pJjQteLFt11WaYkb86KsT5ALuRz.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 17178, "logo_path": null, "name": "Filmgalerie 451", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}], "release_date": "2017-06-23", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 82, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Long Summer of Theory", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.3, "vote_count": 3, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 5, "character": "", "credit_id": "595f72639251410bfa0a29e8", "gender": 1, "id": 1846523, "name": "Julia Zange", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/sGo7uSXbfWrgiRP5yuj4zoI21GO.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "", "credit_id": "595f725c92514179040075e2", "gender": 0, "id": 1324154, "name": "Katja Weilandt", "order": 1, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 6, "character": "", "credit_id": "595f736bc3a36828fc0906b1", "gender": 1, "id": 1276200, "name": "Martina Sch\u00f6ne-Radunski", "order": 2, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 1, "character": "", "credit_id": "595f723ec3a36825e8093e71", "gender": 0, "id": 1761936, "name": "Toby Ashraf", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/v0NIXx8FFw8NSDvQemmfSKAqTHf.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "", "credit_id": "595f724692514179040075c3", "gender": 2, "id": 128758, "name": "Timo Jacobs", "order": 4, "profile_path": "/92brHJtxr5yGoqtYtTbDJigxQMe.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "", "credit_id": "595f724d9251410c560989b6", "gender": 1, "id": 1368894, "name": "Paula Kn\u00fcpling", "order": 5, "profile_path": "/a9aGpzTsf82JnFLhg2ImvlmoCaD.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "595f72359251410b860a0837", "department": "Directing", "gender": 1, "id": 583912, "job": "Director", "name": "Irene von Alberti", "profile_path": null}]}}
