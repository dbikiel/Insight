Eleven of these were won by the defenders of the mission station at Rorke's Drift, Natal, January 22nd to the 23rd 1879.", "poster_path": "/43ddKmYjzNrvS7xvHVwtq03N6xP.jpg", "release_date": "1964-01-22", "title": "Zulu", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.5, "vote_count": 242, "popularity": 12.203}, {"id": 3536, "video": false, "vote_count": 599, "vote_average": 6.3, "title": "U-571", "release_date": "2000-04-20", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "U-571", "genre_ids": [28, 18, 53, 10752], "backdrop_path": "/prGcR88VZWi7HsRyTdIJRjmHSgC.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "In the midst of World War II, the battle under the sea rages and the Nazis have the upper hand as the Allies are unable to crack their war codes.
