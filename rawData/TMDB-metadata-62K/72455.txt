Difficulties range from Jane's apathy to being placed on the marriage block, the determined efforts of Sheila's cousin, Mabel Claremont, (Angela Lansbury) to win wealthy David Fenner (Peter Myers) for her debutante daughter Clarissa (Diane Clare), and Jane's attraction to David Parkson (John Saxon), an American drummer who plays in the orchestra at the coming-out balls.", "poster_path": "/bjKTY9upVOsSAuolYM16TmZa4M6.jpg", "release_date": "1958-01-01", "title": "The Reluctant Debutante", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.2, "vote_count": 19, "popularity": 2.886}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 12}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 3, "character": "Buford Pusser", "credit_id": "52fe486dc3a368484e0f7d17", "gender": 2, "id": 30044, "name": "Bo Svenson", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/xhXC4Vx1T2NwFgadIjgdISM09ia.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Pinky Dobson", "credit_id": "52fe486dc3a368484e0f7d1b", "gender": 2, "id": 8962, "name": "Luke Askew", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/nlV0bfadoMjbz7vxmLl5zALc86H.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Ray Henry", "credit_id": "52fe486dc3a368484e0f7d1f", "gender": 2, "id": 32786, "name": "John Davis Chandler", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/66egeP4tNoXacifMfuzRuewcrRN.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 6, "character": "Obra Eaker", "credit_id": "52fe486dc3a368484e0f7d23", "gender": 2, "id": 30615, "name": "Robert DoQui", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/gbV4NbJWrvbQzEghB9it4pVIG1c.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 7, "character": "Mike Pusser", "credit_id": "52fe486dc3a368484e0f7d27", "gender": 2, "id": 2883, "name": "Leif Garrett", "order": 4, "profile_path": "/bjzqSgp3vfbpMSBR1p4Q1D5CDFp.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 8, "character": "Grady Coker", "credit_id": "52fe486dc3a368484e0f7d2b", "gender": 2, "id": 10194, "name": "Bruce Glover", "order": 5, "profile_path": "/xVS6edZlUempGkjWqSnPnkGcRTw.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 9, "character": "Dwana Pusser", "credit_id": "52fe486dc3a368484e0f7d2f", "gender": 2, "id": 161568, "name": "Dawn Lyn", "order": 6, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 10, "character": "Stud Pardee", "credit_id": "52fe486dc3a368484e0f7d33", "gender": 2, "id": 58423, "name": "Richard Jaeckel", "order": 7, "profile_path": "/4pTd7yoDD46xbFcMuFHh8k448Um.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 11, "character": "Carl Pusser", "credit_id": "52fe486dc3a368484e0f7d37", "gender": 2, "id": 30297, "name": "Noah Beery Jr.", "order": 8, "profile_path": "/dgKPU1Vbq0UiwkT2UyCicpbPEMf.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 12, "character": "Grandma Pusser", "credit_id": "52fe486dc3a368484e0f7d3b", "gender": 1, "id": 19781, "name": "Lurene Tuttle", "order": 9, "profile_path": "/bkaxEJFGflsSVnPqJZSWjI4knUN.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 13, "character": "John Witter", "credit_id": "5a512371925141132600e0bb", "gender": 2, "id": 16031, "name": "Logan Ramsey", "order": 10, "profile_path": "/p0nGZszv0Lv82bABCKxheiegWnh.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 14, "character": "Ruby Ann", "credit_id": "5aa99f6ac3a36851d6000002", "gender": 1, "id": 121356, "name": "Brooke Mills", "order": 11, "profile_path": "/oxwsCOYzIUorMbSd2b1BkJqdMzD.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe486dc3a368484e0f7d0d", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 55456, "job": "Director", "name": "Earl Bellamy", "profile_path": "/1rY0jUJowCFAYndzfs78n1RFFbV.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "52fe486dc3a368484e0f7d13", "department": "Writing", "gender": 2, "id": 131717, "job": "Writer", "name": "Howard B.
