A subplot of the film are two robbers, \"Bossy\" and \"Savage\" who the main characters remain remotely unaware of as they are just a comic theme. Sweet pulls a prank on Weedle during a golf game and is suspended for six month. Sweet also records Weedle having humorous intercourse with a prostitute, \"The Orphan in a Storm\". Sweet then decides to drown his sorrows in a casino at the slot machines, where he tricks a small boy, Alfred \"Shorty\" Short into thinking he is a genie.
