Approximately 70% of smokers want to quit. The United Nations\u2019 World Health Organisation expects a billion people will die prematurely from smoking this century. The products their doctors recommend are rarely effective and many are trapped. A new vapour technology was invented to give smokers a successful way to quit. But it was quickly demonised, and even banned in many countries. A perfect storm is brewing between smokers trying to quit, government regulators, and health charities funded by the powerful pharmaceutical industry. Director Aaron Biebert travelled across four continents interviewing doctors, scientists, and others working to save a billion lives. What he found was profound government failure, widespread corruption in the public health community and powerful subversion by big business.", "popularity": 8.992, "poster_path": "/jCmysd8VgMtG6lBKH0Kjnmyc1gY.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 78710, "logo_path": null, "name": "Attention Era Media", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2016-05-11", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 94, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "A true story of the vaping revolution and tragic corruption leading to a billion deaths around the world.", "title": "A Billion Lives", "video": false, "vote_average": 9.1, "vote_count": 9, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 219731, "name": "nicotine"}, {"id": 226917, "name": "vaping"}, {"id": 226918, "name": "big tobacco"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 9388, "video": false, "vote_count": 1252, "vote_average": 7.2, "title": "Thank You for Smoking", "release_date": "2005-03-17", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Thank You for Smoking", "genre_ids": [35, 18], "backdrop_path": "/D1VqMoYT4K2aFcywu3kGnycD6n.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Nick Naylor is a charismatic spin-doctor for Big Tobacco who'll fight to protect America's right to smoke -- even if it kills him -- while still remaining a role model for his 12-year old son.
