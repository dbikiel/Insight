While chronicling trends among small town and big city kids, we discovered this: Having pubic hair is considered unattractive and \u201cgross.\u201d Most youngsters know someone who has emailed or texted a naked photo of themselves. Many kids have accidentally or intentionally had their first introduction to sex be via hardcore online porn.

This explosive documentary reveals the family courts as unregulated, extra-constitutional fiefdoms. Rather than assist victims of domestic crimes, these courts often precipitate them.
