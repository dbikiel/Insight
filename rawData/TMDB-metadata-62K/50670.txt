It starred Trevor Howard as Sir Henry and Stanshall himself as Henry's brother Hubert. Unusually, the film was released in sepia toned monochrome. As complex as the mind of its creator, Vivian Stanshall, the plot of Sir Henry at Rawlinson End revolves around attempts to exorcise the ghost of Humbert, the brother of Sir Henry (Trevor Howard). Humbert was accidentally killed in a drunken duck-shooting incident whilst escaping from an illicit tryst. Amongst the eccentric family members, mad friends and grudgingly loyal servants involved are the eternally knitting Aunt Florrie, the tapeworm obsessed Mrs. E, Lady Phillipa of Staines (Liz Smith), who enjoys the odd 'small' sherry and the ever-present Old Scrotum, Sir Henry's wrinkled retainer.", "popularity": 2.17, "poster_path": "/gruukLtIDuljZOlnK7azlxKFKDJ.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 103914, "logo_path": null, "name": "Charisma Films", "origin_country": "IN"}, {"id": 4878, "logo_path": null, "name": "Virgin Vision", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "1980-11-07", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 71, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "If a thing is worth doing, it is worth forcing someone else to do it.", "title": "Sir Henry at Rawlinson End", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.9, "vote_count": 4, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 567, "name": "alcohol"}, {"id": 6158, "name": "cult"}, {"id": 10483, "name": "eccentric"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/xxm6PQRbfcSFO4mds8una1bkYPh.jpg", "genre_ids": [35], "id": 8363, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Superbad", "overview": "Two co-dependent high school seniors are forced to deal with separation anxiety after their plan to stage a booze-soaked party goes awry.", "poster_path": "/7RZWtDkf0mgrxvJNFj43YW2Ugi8.jpg", "release_date": "2007-08-17", "title": "Superbad", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.1, "vote_count": 3968, "popularity": 19.274}, {"id": 325133, "video": false, "vote_count": 3097, "vote_average": 5.7, "title": "Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising", "release_date": "2016-05-04", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising", "genre_ids": [35], "backdrop_path": "/8HuO1RMDI3prfWDkF7t1y8EhLVO.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A sorority moves in next door to the home of Mac and Kelly Radner who have a young child.
