Each Saturday, Alicia Vega transforms the chapel of Lo Hermida into a film screening room as she conducts a workshop for children under the auspices of the Catholic church. The hundred or so children involved had never seen a movie, and in the workshop they see and learn about the cinema: photograms and moving images, projection, camera angles and movement, film genres, and much more. And they watch movies: Chaplin, Disney, Lamorisse's 'The Red Balloon,' the Lumieres' 'The Arrival of the Train to the Station.' Finally, each child designs his own film with drawings. And then, for the first time in most of their lives, the children got to the movies in downtown Santiago.", "popularity": 0.6, "poster_path": "/3Rxkf6UlEOP9q1wRFYfNB7TLmbc.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CL", "name": "Chile"}], "release_date": "1988-01-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 55, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "One Hundred Children Waiting for a Train", "video": false, "vote_average": 8.1, "vote_count": 8, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/4RZx1t8b9r0PVkSwnEx3gU3xSuv.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 70747, "original_language": "de", "original_title": "Huacho", "overview": "A Chilean family deals with the new values in a quickly changing world.", "poster_path": "/376BXSjSWXxIxAzX5QEP9lmHsqY.jpg", "release_date": "2009-05-14", "title": "Huacho", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.5, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 1.055}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/hPIRelK4XeSgwjm3NzJHFUbT4Bz.jpg", "genre_ids": [80, 18], "id": 157319, "original_language": "qu", "original_title": "Yawar mallku", "overview": "A community reacts against a group of foreigners who under the guise of development assistance are forcibly sterilizing the peasant women.", "poster_path": "/tFuseNgAC5GaOZZwFIS7VDuN6W6.jpg", "release_date": "1969-11-20", "title": "Blood of the Condor", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.8, "vote_count": 10, "popularity": 1.862}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/3vlfveu2rSSPKJjHU8jEKBmXgCt.jpg", "genre_ids": [99, 18], "id": 213598, "original_language": "es", "original_title": "La Morte Rouge", "overview": "Famed Spanish director Victor Erice narrates this documentary short about the first film he remembers seeing, Roy William Neill's 1944 Sherlock Holmes film \"The Scarlet Claw.\" Erice's memories of this formative cinematic experience lead him to musings on post-Civil War Spain, childhood fears, and the nature of memory itself.", "poster_path": "/aGTstT5OmnjjfiLiimZyvzIz4YV.jpg", "release_date": "2006-02-09", "title": "La Morte Rouge", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.3, "vote_count": 6, "popularity": 0.891}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99], "id": 151441, "original_language": "es", "original_title": "Tire di\u00e9", "overview": "Everyday the children of the neighborhood known as \"Tire Di\u00e9\", in the city of Santa Fe, wait for the train to ask for money, shouting \"Tire di\u00e9!\" (toss me a dime!) to the passengers.
