His convictions cost him his life.  What is a moral person to do in a time of savage immorality? That question tormented Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German clergyman of great distinction who actively opposed Hitler and the Nazis. His convictions cost him his life. The Nazis hanged him on April 9, 1945, less than a month before the end of the war. Bonhoeffer's last years, his participation in the German resistance and his moral struggle are dramatized in this film. More than just a biographical portrait, Bonhoeffer: Agent of Grace sheds light on the little-known efforts of the German resistance. It brings to a wide audience the heroic rebellion of Bonhoeffer, a highly regarded Lutheran minister who could have kept his peace and saved his life on several occasions but instead paid the ultimate price for his beliefs.", "popularity": 1.513, "poster_path": "/eT3tw9frcoqxelqTgvEgg6xYubE.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2000-06-14", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 88, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "A true story of love, courage, and sacrifice.", "title": "Bonhoeffer: Agent of Grace", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.8, "vote_count": 4, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 1956, "name": "world war ii"}, {"id": 160253, "name": "dietrich bonhoeffer"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/qtD2lFLG5T7L8flbKSEIoSqcslI.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 10752], "id": 7862, "original_language": "de", "original_title": "Die F\u00e4lscher", "overview": "The story Jewish counterfeiter, Salomon Sorowitsch, coerced into assisting the Nazi operation of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp during World War II.", "poster_path": "/bRQddrgVemZtFdnrPy9AxTpkhpj.jpg", "release_date": "2007-02-09", "title": "The Counterfeiters", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.4, "vote_count": 261, "popularity": 8.902}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/pKawqrtCBMmxarft7o1LbEynys7.jpg", "genre_ids": [10752, 18, 28], "id": 228150, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Fury", "overview": "In the last months of World War II, as the Allies make their final push in the European theatre, a battle-hardened U.S. Army sergeant named 'Wardaddy' commands a Sherman tank called 'Fury' and its five-man crew on a deadly mission behind enemy lines.
