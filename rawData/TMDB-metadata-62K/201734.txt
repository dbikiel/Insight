But as this gripping doc reveals, the cost to bring such delicacies to the table is enormous. Bestselling novelist Jonathan Franzen takes a break from the world of fiction to guide us through an all too horrifying reality: tens of millions of protected migratory songbirds are illegally killed every year. Franzen, a longtime bird lover, accompanies young staffers of the Committee Against Bird Slaughter on their expeditions. With police enforcement in Southern Europe practically non-existent, they risk their lives to rescue trapped birds, and confront hostile poachers. It's a topic that proves a cultural flashpoint -- the Cypriot landowners cannot understand why a bunch of Italians can tell them what to do on their land.", "popularity": 0.6, "poster_path": "/zoQaqViO0OvNeF708Fhtdj7XwE.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2015-04-22", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 78, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Emptying the Skies", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "532f82e8c3a3685fbb005100", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1303997, "job": "Director", "name": "Doug Kass", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "532f83169251413a78004147", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 960477, "job": "Director", "name": "Roger Kass", "profile_path": null}]}}
