With the long Victoria Day weekend signaling the end of school, and the Stanley Cup playoffs afoot, the summer of 1988 arrives in Toronto.  Ben Spector, a smart, sensitive kid from a Russian immigrant family, hits the Bob Dylan show with his buddies and runs into Jordan Chapman, the class jerk and Ben's tormentor on the ice-hockey rink.  Jordan is five dollars shy of scoring some drugs, and Ben begrudgingly spots him the dough.  But the next day, Jordan fails to show up at school or hockey practice.  With days passing and Jordan's whereabouts a mystery, Ben finds himself in an uncomfortable predicament, especially when a romance with Jordan's sister tentatively blooms in the midst of the ordeal.", "popularity": 0.722, "poster_path": "/gfg7LbC96ZkfdqtxHJyx1QZngIF.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 38725, "logo_path": null, "name": "E1 Entertainment", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CA", "name": "Canada"}], "release_date": "2009-01-17", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 88, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ru", "name": "P\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439"}, {"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "Life Changes In A Flash.", "title": "Victoria Day", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 2407, "name": "fireworks"}, {"id": 4227, "name": "toronto, canada"}, {"id": 5286, "name": "bob dylan"}, {"id": 13088, "name": "summer"}, {"id": 13130, "name": "teenager"}, {"id": 208289, "name": "1980s"}, {"id": 210268, "name": "long weekend"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 11887, "video": false, "vote_count": 2347, "vote_average": 6.5, "title": "High School Musical 3: Senior Year", "release_date": "2008-10-11", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "High School Musical 3: Senior Year", "genre_ids": [35, 18, 10402, 10749, 10751], "backdrop_path": "/daSGxGZL2nNjGZKkAF5ain3lmOx.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "It's almost graduation day for high school seniors Troy, Gabriella, Sharpay, Chad, Ryan and Taylor \u2015 and the thought of heading off in separate directions after leaving East High has these Wildcats thinking they need to do something they'll remember forever.
