She discusses the book with a range of experts, biographers and distinguished cultural figures - from actor Richard E Grant to children's author Philip Pullman - and explores with them the mystery of how a retiring, buttoned-up and meticulous mathematics don, who spent almost his entire life within the cloistered confines of Christ Church Oxford, was able to capture the world of childhood in such a captivating way.", "popularity": 1.411, "poster_path": "/cCIRzgF7MqKaENfl4wtOnXykoFU.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 80770, "logo_path": null, "name": "Swan Films", "origin_country": "GB"}, {"id": 3324, "logo_path": "/16fY7pucCzn7WSOYxOGRHlAayL3.png", "name": "BBC", "origin_country": "GB"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "2015-01-31", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 59, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Secret World of Lewis Carroll", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 12552, "name": "alice in wonderland"}, {"id": 228876, "name": "lewis carroll"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/5klTcCBZDCANrYTPf1WuAh8U22f.jpg", "genre_ids": [10751, 14, 878, 10770], "id": 35109, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Alice in Wonderland", "overview": "Alice in Wonderland (1966) is a BBC television play based on Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll.
