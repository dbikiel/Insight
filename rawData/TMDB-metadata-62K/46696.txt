Due to Imperial cover-ups, the full story may never be known. This story has been filmed several times, in French in 1935 and in English in 1968. Hungarian director Miklos Jancso recreates those events for his own purposes, continuing his favored theme of the rejection of paternal authority. In the film, which has very little dialog, Rudolf is a good-natured pan-sexual golden boy, who cavorts on his rural estate with a host of beautiful, aristocratic lovers and friends of both sexes. He refuses to leave his country idyll even though he has been ordered to by the Emperor, his father. Despite the fact that for a large part of the film, attractive young people go about unclothed and engaging in erotic encounters, the mood is one of melancholy rather than prurience.", "popularity": 6.074, "poster_path": "/3HMyvLoP5XUMhDlJj0Apv7tqtsp.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 168, "logo_path": "/AmNSNdDaByDpc0bzekWFeYRXDW2.png", "name": "Jadran Film", "origin_country": "HR"}, {"id": 6397, "logo_path": null, "name": "Filmes Cinematografica", "origin_country": "IT"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "IT", "name": "Italy"}, {"iso_3166_1": "HR", "name": "Croatia"}], "release_date": "1976-05-06", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 104, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}, {"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}, {"iso_639_1": "hu", "name": "Magyar"}, {"iso_639_1": "it", "name": "Italiano"}, {"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "Royal passions that rocked a Crown...", "title": "Private Vices, Public Virtues", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.5, "vote_count": 13, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 6140, "name": "vice"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 2928, "video": false, "vote_count": 322, "vote_average": 5.7, "title": "Michael", "release_date": "1996-12-25", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Michael", "genre_ids": [35, 18, 14], "backdrop_path": "/kvTwGW1bdu46pP5FmizId07CazQ.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Tabloid reporters are sent by their editor to investigate after the paper recieves a letter from a woman claiming an angel is living with her.", "poster_path": "/xof1HmoI3NrSrmzHByjK6W7dU8E.jpg", "popularity": 10.781}, {"id": 11892, "video": false, "vote_count": 549, "vote_average": 6.1, "title": "Murder by Numbers", "release_date": "2002-04-19", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Murder by Numbers", "genre_ids": [80, 18, 53], "backdrop_path": "/lcYEctb1Llygf048dXNqKnDYjNw.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Tenacious homicide detective Cassie Mayweather and her still-green partner are working a murder case, attempting to profile two malevolently brilliant young men: cold, calculating killers whose dark secrets might explain their crimes.", "poster_path": "/zL2aUMe2haBikOZSxmndSDD4qi.jpg", "popularity": 11.237}, {"id": 986, "video": false, "vote_count": 74, "vote_average": 7.3, "title": "Chimes at Midnight", "release_date": "1965-12-22", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Campanadas de medianoche", "genre_ids": [35, 18, 36], "backdrop_path": "/15ap1Fi1ZR4xdE6wcZrlVt6W5rf.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "The career of Shakespeare's Sir John Falstaff as roistering companion to young Prince Hal, circa 1400-1413.", "poster_path": "/5o4GubdnLhuZytMIbvoQhj8S7lA.jpg", "popularity": 6.713}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/447jSult4ccYwUjtYPdiiPPmogl.jpg", "genre_ids": [80, 18, 28, 53], "id": 14664, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Sharky's Machine", "overview": "Police officer Tom Sharky gets busted back to working vice, where he happens upon a scandalous conspiracy involving a local politician.
