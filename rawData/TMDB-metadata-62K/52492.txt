Their efforts are hampered each year by the presence of the sea, which invariably floods the fields with saltwater and wipes out the crops. In desperation, the mother realizes that their only hope lies in the construction of a sea wall to prevent continued flooding, but the mother must cut a swath through the local bureaucracy in an almost Sisyphean attempt to make this happen. Meanwhile, her obstinate daughter, Suzanne, draws the romantic obsessions of a well-to-do Chinese gentleman, Monsieur Jo; though he could easily provide a way out, the possibility of a romantic relationship between Jo and Suzanne could just as easily fall prey to local racial prejudices that would damage or ruin the lives of both.", "popularity": 3.007, "poster_path": "/pV4KyYxrY7HWKkcEZ5ovlnwm3iW.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 17084, "logo_path": null, "name": "Catherine Dussart Productions (CDP)", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}, {"iso_3166_1": "VN", "name": "Vietnam"}], "release_date": "2008-01-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 115, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}, {"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Sea Wall", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.6, "vote_count": 11, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 108887, "video": false, "vote_count": 4, "vote_average": 8.3, "title": "Demented", "release_date": "2006-10-07", "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "Le dernier des fous", "genre_ids": [18], "backdrop_path": "/um5nUmV1jte7eVrkHhkpoz1y3Bj.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "It\u2019s summer and the beginning of the long vacation period for eleven-year-old Martin, who lives on a farm, and, at a loss, observes his family\u2019s disintegration : his mother lives locked-up in her room ; his older brother, who he adores, drowns himself in drink ; and his father, dominated by Martin\u2019s grandmother, is a helpless onlooker to the family\u2019s collapse.
