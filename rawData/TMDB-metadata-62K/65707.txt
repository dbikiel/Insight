Peter Weiss intended to create associative images that can not be deciphered completely. Beyond any logical interpretation, he wanted to show pure inner feelings. In a conversation with Harun Farocki from 1980, Peter Weiss admitted in retrospect that the images had very well developed a strong psychological effect. Referring to the situation of his exile, he stated that \"this had to do with the traumatic as well as dreamlike experience of rupture and alienation.\"  (UbuWeb)", "poster_path": "/n4u6XSoK6VyrHOGIMvQu6oLtn4K.jpg", "release_date": "1952-12-31", "title": "Studie II: Hallucinationer", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.6, "vote_count": 11, "popularity": 1.041}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [16], "id": 209752, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "69", "overview": "Robert Breer animation from 1970.  16mm, color, silent, using spray paint & stencils.", "poster_path": "/lj33kNS5OS21hxAp6rmhI7huTOB.jpg", "release_date": "1969-04-10", "title": "69", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.5, "vote_count": 13, "popularity": 2.452}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99], "id": 129532, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Castro Street", "overview": "Inspired by a lesson from Erik Satie, a film in the form of a street: Castro Street, running by the Standard Oil Refinery in Richmond, California.", "poster_path": "/kych8w0YWnBjiHb7Y37IgJSk70a.jpg", "release_date": "1966-08-10", "title": "Castro Street", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.4, "vote_count": 14, "popularity": 1.798}, {"id": 35642, "video": false, "vote_count": 20, "vote_average": 6.1, "title": "Dr. Caligari", "release_date": "1989-01-01", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Dr. Caligari", "genre_ids": [35, 14, 27, 878], "backdrop_path": "/qFCNVtd8vHCiyS38J6Iz8SDPyd4.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Mrs. Van Houten has shown signs of losing touch with reality, and her husband discusses possible treatment with Dr. Caligari, who says Mrs. Van Houten has a disease of the libido.", "poster_path": "/vkF6K7nnhhWKqImqmYQFhvnr4iY.jpg", "popularity": 4.758}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/pI1WSwtqnLNiLT27VuYxHc68mPG.jpg", "genre_ids": [], "id": 144156, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Dream Work", "overview": "Experimental shot film by Peter Tscherkassky utilizing found footage.", "poster_path": "/uASRRVwSdr3OpUPX59ugWpTJgcs.jpg", "release_date": "2001-03-17", "title": "Dream Work", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.1, "vote_count": 18, "popularity": 1.733}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 153082, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Fotel", "overview": "A story about the fight for power told with the help of simple graphics.

Garrel made a name for himself with this film as a new Jean Vigo. With Nico (Velvet Underground).  A poetic and painterly film that has been described as 'a collage of dreams'. The film was shot without a script, but Garrel had already thought up the eventual title ('the scar inside'). This title was an obsession for him, every shot had to be an expression of 'the scar inside'. Apart from Garrel himself and actor Pierre Clementi, Garrel's former partner Nico, member of the legendary Velvet Underground, played a role in the film. Another important role was for the landscape. Garrel, 23 when he made the film, was compared with Jean Vigo because of his age and talent. La cicatrice int\u00e9rieure even led Claude Mauriac to call him the Rimbaud of film.
