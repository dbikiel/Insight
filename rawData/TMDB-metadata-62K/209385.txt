Danuta Szaflarska stars as Aniela, who lives in a massive yet rapidly-deteriorating wooden house, filled with souvenirs and treasures of eras gone by. Aniela runs into conflict in her dealings with others, particularly a nasty neighbor who sees her property as an eyesore and wants to do everything in his reach to buy it up and tear it down, and her married adult son, who - though kindly - triggers paranoia within Aniela (she cannot help but believe that he is scheming and planning to wheedle the property away from her). Driven aback by these individuals, Aniela finds one of her only sources of comfort and reassurance in her daily talks with her dog, Fila - and develops a great affinity for spying on the neighbors' doings whenever boredom creeps in.", "poster_path": "/k1tPG9JZZMe1cFYLv0R4utx6D0d.jpg", "release_date": "2007-10-19", "title": "Time to Die", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.3, "vote_count": 8, "popularity": 2.935}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/77Myb1XPkVLsxcJkwgGIvKyhdOb.jpg", "genre_ids": [35], "id": 39331, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Cia\u0142o", "overview": "One day a commuter, who happens to be a burglar, finds a dead body on a train.
