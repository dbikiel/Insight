His children leave with his wife on holiday, and he is lonely and depressed. His friend R\u00e9mi  drags him to a party in the country, and driving back they see by chance a notice of a house being sold at auction by creditors. The low reserve price surprises them and they go round to have a look. Finding the door open, Malo picks up a letter from a little girl to her father saying she misses him - moved by the resonance with his own daughter, Malo accidentally takes the note with him when they leave in a hurry. He then resolves to return the note to the now grown-up little girl Clo\u00e9, but of course it's awkward to explain how he got it. He learns that she really doesn't want to sell the house, which is all that remains of her childhood. The relationship between them develops, and emotions run high at the auction. Ultimately the film explores whether Malo can give both or either Clo\u00e9 and his daughter what they want/need,", "popularity": 0.6, "poster_path": "/ayHs918FKhDm1QsvVQEMNeDmFli.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "2007-08-22", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 95, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "La maison", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 2, "character": "Malo", "credit_id": "52fe4817c3a36847f8157a01", "gender": 2, "id": 16972, "name": "Sergi L\u00f3pez", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/dH5jWen7KE4N3QuNSpeGOVAdIOT.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "R\u00e9mi", "credit_id": "52fe4817c3a36847f8157a05", "gender": 2, "id": 77928, "name": "Bruno Salomone", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/nYF4qc4OfwmVlkKZXDHbg6TtUnG.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Clo\u00e9", "credit_id": "52fe4817c3a36847f8157a09", "gender": 1, "id": 82923, "name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/jC17et46NKU16cztl9iAuckYNib.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Laura", "credit_id": "52fe4817c3a36847f8157a0d", "gender": 1, "id": 81786, "name": "Barbara Schulz", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/7MjKdkEkouRBYUzsr5aVG1idrMG.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 7, "character": "No\u00e9mie", "credit_id": "52fe4817c3a36847f8157a15", "gender": 1, "id": 37923, "name": "Florence Darel", "order": 5, "profile_path": "/zpAg60GH1s1X22thPrAKuEV3mwO.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 8, "character": "Ga\u00eblle", "credit_id": "52fe4817c3a36847f8157a19", "gender": 1, "id": 583630, "name": "Catherine Riaux", "order": 6, "profile_path": "/6h7FbTeT0dT8BaU53PRTeXgjZaj.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 9, "character": "Delphine", "credit_id": "52fe4817c3a36847f8157a1d", "gender": 0, "id": 583654, "name": "Elodie Hesme", "order": 7, "profile_path": "/gogy1ZQYHEL4GKhP3yLlwKQ5Gry.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 10, "character": "J\u00e9r\u00e9mie", "credit_id": "52fe4817c3a36847f8157a21", "gender": 0, "id": 583656, "name": "Tom M\u00e9ziane", "order": 8, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 11, "character": "Antoine", "credit_id": "52fe4817c3a36847f8157a25", "gender": 0, "id": 583658, "name": "L\u00e9o Poirier", "order": 9, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 13, "character": "Nathalie", "credit_id": "5d77cd3a5907de2fb52bd87c", "gender": 1, "id": 144622, "name": "C\u00e9cile Rebboah", "order": 10, "profile_path": "/jrCRKfI8gpCZLzhzqFdY7okgK7i.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4817c3a36847f81579fd", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 40263, "job": "Director", "name": "Manuel Poirier", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5730e6b8c3a36819b10004eb", "department": "Writing", "gender": 2, "id": 40263, "job": "Writer", "name": "Manuel Poirier", "profile_path": null}]}}
