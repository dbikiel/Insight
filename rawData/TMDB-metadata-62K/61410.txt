John Milton is a boy from an ordinary background who wins a scholarship to a private school in Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa. Surrounded by boys with nicknames like Gecko, Rambo, Rain Man and Mad Dog, Spud has his hands full trying to adapt to his new home. Along the way Spud takes his first tentative steps along the path to manhood. (The path it seems could be a rather long road). Spud is an only child. He is cursed with parents from well beyond the lunatic fringe and a senile granny. His dad is a fervent anti-communist who is paranoid that the family domestic worker is running a shebeen from her room at the back of the family home. His mom is a free spirit and a teenager's worst nightmare, whether it's shopping for Spud's underwear in the local supermarket", "popularity": 6.77, "poster_path": "/x3yH9xeeP1CZwDgZO7FBygeB2K4.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 28149, "logo_path": null, "name": "Rogue Star Films", "origin_country": "ZA"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "ZA", "name": "South Africa"}], "release_date": "2010-12-03", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 103, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Spud", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.9, "vote_count": 30, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/mUA4cTeJ7UWJk6l3EIzPf9Q4aDu.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 18], "id": 200580, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Spud 2: The Madness Continues", "overview": "The year is 1991, and Spud Milton's long walk to manhood is still creeping along at an unnervingly slow pace.

With a mother hell-bent on emigrating, a father making a killing out of selling homemade moonshine, and a demented grandmother called Wombat, the new year seems to offer little except extreme embarrassment and more mortifying Milton madness.
