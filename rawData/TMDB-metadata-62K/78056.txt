U2 chose the castle venue because it marked two watershed moments for the band: their recording session for the landmark album THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE in 1984, and their first Slane appearance opening up for fellow Irish rock band Thin Lizzy in 1981. U2 GO HOME captures the emotional intensity of the homecoming with 19 live tracks culled from the concerts, including \"Elevation,\" \"New Year's Day,\" \"Angel of Harlem,\" \"With or Without You,\" \"Pride (In the Name of Love),\" and 14 others. The DVD also includes THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE documentary, which profiles the making of that classic album.", "poster_path": "/v1cYisYwuS9TCF90KI9UPoihSzf.jpg", "release_date": "2003-11-17", "title": "U2: Go Home - Live From Slane Castle", "video": true, "vote_average": 8.1, "vote_count": 16, "popularity": 1.835}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 9}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1001, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "52fe498bc3a368484e130ccf", "gender": 2, "id": 82426, "name": "The Edge", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/oB64cRlIPxNwXjQp9npCo1eGbsM.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 1002, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "52fe498bc3a368484e130cd3", "gender": 0, "id": 82427, "name": "Adam Clayton", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/fqCXyDitGMPzAPvCsAtZ1spor1R.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 1003, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "52fe498bc3a368484e130cd7", "gender": 2, "id": 82428, "name": " Larry Mullen Jr.", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/xHKSUpnNubNaA3ABVhcYgG5s4LT.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 1004, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "52fe498bc3a368484e130cdb", "gender": 2, "id": 33684, "name": "Bono", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/pj3JYEJlVkNV91fxDHkgWKhDdot.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe498bc3a368484e130ce1", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 19012, "job": "Director", "name": "Davis Guggenheim", "profile_path": "/wsq8gRMA63QZeOEdkq4I5xiUzWC.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "55281c8ac3a3681903000540", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 1452398, "job": "Producer", "name": "Belisa Balaban", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "55281c9bc3a36818f300054e", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 1452399, "job": "Producer", "name": "Brian Celler", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "55281cb3925141476e00045c", "department": "Production", "gender": 2, "id": 19012, "job": "Producer", "name": "Davis Guggenheim", "profile_path": "/wsq8gRMA63QZeOEdkq4I5xiUzWC.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "57478071c3a3686ba0000065", "department": "Production", "gender": 2, "id": 1244042, "job": "Producer", "name": "Ted Skillman", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5c2c385a0e0a261eaf38a982", "department": "Editing", "gender": 2, "id": 13227, "job": "Editor", "name": "Jay Cassidy", "profile_path": "/f63siBS3qKfoOPZHS74r3zFhWGW.jpg"}]}}
