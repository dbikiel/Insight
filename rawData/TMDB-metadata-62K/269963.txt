Machinery assists the bulb manufacture. A virtuoso glassblower begins a more complex tube used in radio broadcasting; it is then turned, fired, and sculpted. Conveyors carry partially completed units. Workers perform their various specific assembly-line tasks. Cases are manufactured and machined, wire harnesses are assembled, loudspeakers are produced. As radios near completion, they are run through a series of tests. Engineers and draughtsmen define future developments. In a closing stop-motion sequence, in a style reminiscent of Norman McLaren, a group of loudspeakers performs a playful dance. The film overall is a poetic depiction of an industrial process.", "poster_path": "/4mNVqZeOWV0VcRlqCxXQlows3fL.jpg", "release_date": "1931-08-27", "title": "Philips-Radio", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 8, "popularity": 0.968}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/5UPvvw5GaumbYx8I7lfOIpPLb5r.jpg", "genre_ids": [], "id": 265422, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Pas \u00e0 deux", "overview": "An animated short film of dancers from Monique Renault and Gerrit van Dijk.", "poster_path": "/nTFBd1cYulKvCqaIvXTPhvlHG82.jpg", "release_date": "1988-12-31", "title": "Pas \u00e0 deux", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 4, "popularity": 1.554}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [16], "id": 452915, "original_language": "nl", "original_title": "Ik beweeg, dus ik besta", "overview": "", "poster_path": "/tyMBufvNSxp43CK1GPxDfh8DmFm.jpg", "release_date": "1998-01-01", "title": "I Move, So I Am", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.7, "vote_count": 3, "popularity": 1.4}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 176298, "original_language": "de", "original_title": "Opus III", "overview": "An abstract animation from Walter Ruttmann.", "poster_path": "/wB5f6gOiqHR8lJWxjIlBJnLbF0s.jpg", "release_date": "1924-03-11", "title": "Opus III", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.8, "vote_count": 8, "popularity": 1.676}, {"id": 190305, "video": false, "vote_count": 8, "vote_average": 5.8, "title": "Skyscraper Symphony", "release_date": "1929-04-30", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Skyscraper Symphony", "genre_ids": [99], "backdrop_path": null, "adult": false, "overview": "A montage of the skyscrapers of Manhattan opens with a succession of stationary views of the upper portions of numerous buildings.
