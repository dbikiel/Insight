Lastly she's the first non-Hebrew protagonist in the Bible since Abraham sired the Hebrew people. It's a simple story in the Old Testament. Ruth is one of two Moabite women who marry the sons of Elimelech and Naomi. When Elimelech and sons Mahlon and Chillion die, leaving Naomi a widow with two widowed daughters-in-law, Naomi decides to return to Israel. One daughter-in-law, Orpah, bids her goodbye. Daughter-in-law Ruth however says she will not desert her. She's going to give up the life and culture of Moab and her people will be Naomi's people in the most famous line from the Book of Ruth.", "popularity": 5.772, "poster_path": "/6Q5DbFwGa8kAnKGtLI2rJiRxwbW.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 25, "logo_path": "/qZCc1lty5FzX30aOCVRBLzaVmcp.png", "name": "20th Century Fox", "origin_country": "US"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1960-06-17", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 132, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "All The Spectacle Of Heathen Idolatry, Human Sacrifice, Pagan Revels - All The Beauty Of One Of The Bible's Timeless Love Stories!", "title": "The Story of Ruth", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.3, "vote_count": 8, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 178271, "name": "priestess"}, {"id": 183814, "name": "hebrew"}, {"id": 186756, "name": "old testament"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 147441, "video": false, "vote_count": 3120, "vote_average": 5.8, "title": "Exodus: Gods and Kings", "release_date": "2014-12-03", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Exodus: Gods and Kings", "genre_ids": [28, 12, 18], "backdrop_path": "/hOOgtrByGgWfqGTTn5VL7jkLYXJ.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "The defiant leader Moses rises up against the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses, setting 400,000 slaves on a monumental journey of escape from Egypt and its terrifying cycle of deadly plagues.", "poster_path": "/ycDcPCpWM7hSdIR6tFkOzQPkve2.jpg", "popularity": 34.129}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/sO6AnUEirDnaxjy8dxaqYEKDxGi.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 36], "id": 6844, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Ten Commandments", "overview": "Escaping death, a Hebrew infant is raised in a royal household to become a prince.
