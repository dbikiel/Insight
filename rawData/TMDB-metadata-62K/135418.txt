Geraldine does have a boyfriend, but she's not sure she's ready for marriage, and, anyway, he lives in Los Angeles and Geraldine doesn't want to leave her mother alone in her declining years. Mrs. Tan's cheerful brother-in-law tries to help out. Is there any solution that will enable Mrs. Tan to hold onto her culturally-influenced and deep-seated hopes, yet keep those hopes from suffocating Geraldine?", "popularity": 1.001, "poster_path": "/me5D6s47C5i1M3xT1KRTWF7l3wV.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1985-08-09", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 88, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Dim Sum: A Little Bit of Heart", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.5, "vote_count": 2, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 3, "character": "Geraldine Tam", "credit_id": "52fe4bf7c3a368484e1a0753", "gender": 0, "id": 123176, "name": "Laureen Chew", "order": 0, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Mrs. Tam", "credit_id": "52fe4bf7c3a368484e1a0757", "gender": 0, "id": 1102280, "name": "Kim Chew", "order": 1, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Uncle Tam", "credit_id": "52fe4bf7c3a368484e1a075b", "gender": 2, "id": 11395, "name": "Victor Wong", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/70vAqnH2QFhLOenNQCVcaG1JhN3.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 6, "character": "Auntie May", "credit_id": "52fe4bf7c3a368484e1a075f", "gender": 0, "id": 1102281, "name": "Ida F.O.
