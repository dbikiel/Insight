The parents work as cleaners in a \"love hotel\" and send the kids out to work as ticket scalpers, block-buying seats for hit movies like A City of Sadness and reselling them at a profit. Tragedy strikes when the daughter Mei-Hsueh flirts with the idea of prostituting herself and changes her mind at the last moment, leaving her first client with injuries that put him on the critical list. The focus throughout is on the son Ah Tong, who has a latent talent as a writer that is never going to flower.", "popularity": 0.6, "poster_path": "/h2zdPErgsemldRP1U5pG8xz54ez.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "TW", "name": "Taiwan"}], "release_date": "1989-01-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 76, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "zh", "name": "\u666e\u901a\u8bdd"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "All the Corners of the World", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "Ah-tong", "credit_id": "5bbb48869251410a1703f5b9", "gender": 2, "id": 71171, "name": "Lee Kang-Sheng", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/8AmP81tXQrWl6NZBjK4OIup4lb.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "Mei-Hsueh", "credit_id": "5e16ac07cf4b8b00158096dc", "gender": 1, "id": 1972418, "name": "Pei-yu Wu", "order": 2, "profile_path": null}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "5b9e42d0c3a368440301ac87", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 71174, "job": "Director", "name": "Tsai Ming-liang", "profile_path": "/7un9C6VGcjveENYXQIqLPeP7YZx.jpg"}]}}
