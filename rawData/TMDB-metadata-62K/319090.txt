Not only is it the most polluted city in the country, it is also crippled by decrepit infrastructure and even shakier economic prospects. But Mayor Geng Tanbo plans to change all that, announcing a bold, new plan to return Datong to its former glory, the cultural haven it was some 1,600 years ago. Such declarations, however, come at a devastatingly high cost. Thousands of homes are to be bulldozed, and a half-million of its residents (30 percent of Datong\u2019s total population) will be relocated under his watch. Whether he succeeds depends entirely on his ability to calm swarms of furious workers and an increasingly perturbed ruling elite. The Chinese Mayor captures, with remarkable access, a man and, by extension, a country leaping frantically into an increasingly unstable future.", "popularity": 1.96, "poster_path": "/uVH2YhncSUKgXJRnOAWXciBGRTW.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CN", "name": "China"}], "release_date": "2015-03-06", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 89, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "zh", "name": "\u666e\u901a\u8bdd"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Chinese Mayor", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.6, "vote_count": 8, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/xMMtKzaAh2K5lCRe9Bs0tSG6PQ.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 311690, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Sam Klemke's Time Machine", "overview": "Sam Klemke has filmed and narrated 50 years of his life, creating a strange and intimate portrait of what it means to be human.", "poster_path": "/f87wxlhy64HyGhClOra4pYZwjkR.jpg", "release_date": "2015-01-23", "title": "Sam Klemke's Time Machine", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 4, "popularity": 2.243}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 393495, "original_language": "as", "original_title": "\u0995\u09a5\u09be\u09a8\u09a6\u09c0", "overview": "Four folk tales from Assam re-imagined as a narrative about four mothers, each facing demons of her own.", "poster_path": "/ctqYGdPfANFnEAjVaehn0iwZVWW.jpg", "release_date": "2016-04-27", "title": "Kothanodi", "video": false, "vote_average": 8.0, "vote_count": 3, "popularity": 1.812}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/eWKkAfcNfGOVyRJtu8tBS0lkdoZ.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 18, 10749], "id": 96534, "original_language": "de", "original_title": "My Last Day Without You", "overview": "On a one-day business trip to New York, a young German business executive falls in love with a singer-songwriter who exposes him to her Brooklyn world and emotions he's never experienced before.", "poster_path": "/6yIdZ1Rnd4QR9u1UrxWEXMTxnnw.jpg", "release_date": "2011-06-11", "title": "My Last Day Without You", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.7, "vote_count": 6, "popularity": 1.081}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [35, 18], "id": 380683, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Mad", "overview": "A matriarch past the point of a nervous breakdown, her two daughters that don't give a damn, and the heat-seeking missiles of resentment they toss at each other.", "poster_path": "/hvBmgQ1nQaWP77OanLIaMnHB6I4.jpg", "release_date": "2016-01-22", "title": "Mad", "video": false, "vote_average": 8.0, "vote_count": 3, "popularity": 2.627}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99], "id": 314672, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Placebo", "overview": "All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) is one of the toughest med schools in the world (with an acceptance rate of less than 0.1%).
