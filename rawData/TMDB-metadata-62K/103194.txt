Based on expert advice and meticulous research, Blackout combines real user-generated footage, alongside fictional scenes, CCTV archive and news reports to build a terrifyingly realistic account of Britain being plunged into darkness.  The film plots the days following a nationwide power cut, as experienced by a cast of ordinary characters struggling to feed and protect themselves and their families. These eyewitness accounts reveal the disastrous impact of a prolonged blackout on hospitals, law and order, transport, and our food and water supplies.  The programme casts members of the public from user-generated footage, weaving real-life archive with scripted drama to tell the story of how Britain could descend into chaos and anarchy without power.", "poster_path": "/5jPehoZD9tJSF3MjxsiSvDO9HiZ.jpg", "release_date": "2013-09-08", "title": "Blackout", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.5, "vote_count": 6, "popularity": 1.351}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 1}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "Narrator", "credit_id": "52fe4a19c3a36847f81b9617", "gender": 2, "id": 6818, "name": "Werner Herzog", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/uzVcWEmasjz1Wl7w5mBF5vmmHlK.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "5a426f730e0a2620e0052a5b", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 6824, "job": "Director", "name": "Erik Nelson", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe4a19c3a36847f81b961d", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 1055222, "job": "Director", "name": "David Krentz", "profile_path": null}]}}
