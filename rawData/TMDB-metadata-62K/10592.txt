William McNamara is imprisoned in a brutal German POW camp. Still, as the senior-ranking American officer, he commands his fellow inmates, keeping a sense of honor alive in a place where honor is easy to destroy, all under the dangerous eye of the Luftwafe vetran Col. Wilhelm Visser. Never giving up the fight to win the war, McNamara is silently planning, waiting for his moment to strike back at the enemy. A murder in the camp gives him the chance to set a risky plan in motion. With a court martial to keep Visser and the Germans distracted, McNamara orchestrates a cunning scheme to escape and destroy a nearby munitions plant, enlisting the unwitting help of young Lt. Tommy Hart. Together with his men, McNamara uses a hero's resolve to carry out his mission, ultimately forced to weigh the value of his life against the good of his country.", "popularity": 10.97, "poster_path": "/yRUhSU7vzs5ePa72LNPcKKCCMZ5.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 496, "logo_path": null, "name": "David Foster Productions", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 890, "logo_path": null, "name": "Cheyenne Enterprises", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 21447, "logo_path": null, "name": "David Ladd Films", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 21, "logo_path": "/mjofSXiHpG5t6KYmU4l4FrUhT7m.png", "name": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "origin_country": "US"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2002-02-15", "revenue": 32287044, "runtime": 125, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}, {"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "Beyond Courage, Beyond Honor.", "title": "Hart's War", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.3, "vote_count": 468, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 577, "name": "black people"}, {"id": 1956, "name": "world war ii"}, {"id": 1968, "name": "prisoner of war"}, {"id": 4595, "name": "u.s. army"}, {"id": 6091, "name": "war"}, {"id": 10685, "name": "escape"}, {"id": 10859, "name": "tribunal"}, {"id": 11038, "name": "trial"}, {"id": 13065, "name": "soldier"}, {"id": 14519, "name": "military tribunal"}, {"id": 160910, "name": "xenophobia"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/pKawqrtCBMmxarft7o1LbEynys7.jpg", "genre_ids": [10752, 18, 28], "id": 228150, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Fury", "overview": "In the last months of World War II, as the Allies make their final push in the European theatre, a battle-hardened U.S. Army sergeant named 'Wardaddy' commands a Sherman tank called 'Fury' and its five-man crew on a deadly mission behind enemy lines.
