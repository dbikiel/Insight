It starred Seinfeld's Jason Alexander and Vanessa Williams of Desperate Housewives.  While this version remained mostly faithful to the original musical (Michael Stewart remains the only credited author of this version), several songs were added and re-arranged, and dialogue was slightly rewritten to smoothly facilitate the musical changes.  The musical revolves around an Elvis Presley-type rocker who's about to join the Army. To mark the occasion, his manager's secretary arranges for him to kiss a random fan goodbye on The Ed Sullivan Show. Bye Bye Birdie earned four Tony awards in 1961, including Best Musical and Best Actor in a Musical for its original star, Dick Van Dyke.  In addition to Alexander and Williams, ABC's production starred Tyne Daly, George Wendt, Chynna Phillips and Mark Kudisch.", "poster_path": "/fDZEe9oWgvx5wkhma9cxZ6GOxDr.jpg", "release_date": "1995-12-03", "title": "Bye Bye Birdie", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.6, "vote_count": 11, "popularity": 2.438}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/n9QAQpBt9fJJ1O8ohopIFdMkLhA.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 27], "id": 27070, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Chopper Chicks in Zombietown", "overview": "Riding around on their motorbikes, a gang of tough women bikers are the only thing that stands between a crowd of zombies, which have been accidentally let out of their secure cave, and those still alive in the town.", "poster_path": "/yiDgOo4vwllcSZPIxOtdlFOLEiB.jpg", "release_date": "1989-04-05", "title": "Chopper Chicks in Zombietown", "video": false, "vote_average": 3.9, "vote_count": 13, "popularity": 3.902}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 11}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "Adult Colin Craven", "credit_id": "52fe4718c3a36847f8123417", "gender": 2, "id": 5472, "name": "Colin Firth", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/4pj31PUxqpuJZrHChinub4gr2ul.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "Mary Lennox", "credit_id": "52fe4718c3a36847f812341b", "gender": 1, "id": 137951, "name": "Gennie James", "order": 1, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 6, "character": "Dickon Sowerby", "credit_id": "52fe4718c3a36847f8123431", "gender": 2, "id": 29508, "name": "Barret Oliver", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/20MDrTcH9QJI9VK5vFQH6jKTVBZ.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 7, "character": "Colin Craven", "credit_id": "52fe4718c3a36847f8123435", "gender": 0, "id": 553420, "name": "Jadrien Steele", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/xeaNCT3YHqw8E8EY1G6Waa140m7.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 8, "character": "Ben Weatherstaff", "credit_id": "52fe4718c3a36847f8123439", "gender": 2, "id": 39741, "name": "Michael Hordern", "order": 4, "profile_path": "/bdnxQrWH4hM7jo8fzGpcqSQeCSq.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 9, "character": "Mrs. Medlock", "credit_id": "52fe4718c3a36847f812343d", "gender": 1, "id": 8226, "name": "Billie Whitelaw", "order": 5, "profile_path": "/5XSUS3oSuG2CtJQPiEBQd9AAmg4.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 10, "character": "Archibald Craven", "credit_id": "52fe4718c3a36847f8123441", "gender": 2, "id": 937, "name": "Derek Jacobi", "order": 6, "profile_path": "/6wJPzrqq4GPO7jBLVEM293LUWU1.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 11, "character": "Mrs. Lennox", "credit_id": "52fe4718c3a36847f8123445", "gender": 1, "id": 55907, "name": "Lucy Gutteridge", "order": 7, "profile_path": "/atVD6PfgrBN1gGagnI63nNaQYdJ.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 12, "character": "Colonel McGraw", "credit_id": "59a62a8092514112d0001f1d", "gender": 2, "id": 740, "name": "Julian Glover", "order": 8, "profile_path": "/2sQWrB4of8O2k7DGwJ3OdGJi2Mj.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 13, "character": "Martha Sowerby", "credit_id": "59a62a92c3a36827bd0020f0", "gender": 1, "id": 91536, "name": "Cassie Stuart", "order": 9, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 14, "character": "John the Footman", "credit_id": "59a62aa792514112d0001f68", "gender": 2, "id": 79638, "name": "Edward Tudor-Pole", "order": 10, "profile_path": "/nXXbamwAh4uHb97kjhFayiBI1pX.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 15, "character": "Captain Lennox", "credit_id": "59a62abdc3a36827ae001f24", "gender": 2, "id": 8435, "name": "Stephen Dillane", "order": 11, "profile_path": "/4LOq4XUIsUTO1VdwqL1BWZIMRL3.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4718c3a36847f8123421", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 127486, "job": "Director", "name": "Alan Grint", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe4718c3a36847f8123427", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 68690, "job": "Writer", "name": "Frances Hodgson Burnett", "profile_path": "/AoCiYPDSUzMmIyL3IYALVJcSVm3.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "52fe4718c3a36847f812342d", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 166244, "job": "Writer", "name": "Blanche Hanalis", "profile_path": "/quvndSbxEaCLiUWYKRnUAbtd3BC.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "5b53fe210e0a26232402a52b", "department": "Production", "gender": 2, "id": 36117, "job": "Executive Producer", "name": "Norman Rosemont", "profile_path": null}]}}
