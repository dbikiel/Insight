Offered a business license and asked to join the Chamber of Commerce, Lynch opened and maintained his business according to the most rigorous standards available. However, marijuana remains a Class 1 narcotic according to the DEA, and Lynch's business soon became the target of a large Federal investigation. This film explores the horrific descent into hell faced by Mr. Lynch - previously a law abiding citizen without so much as a speeding ticket, as he is cast as a Pablo Escobar and thrown into Federal detention.", "popularity": 0.655, "poster_path": "/nHjpw05NhkmI8vOfuydmuiOPWrO.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2012-04-20", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 100, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Lynching Charlie Lynch", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.0, "vote_count": 2, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4d1cc3a368484e1d7997", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 67314, "job": "Director", "name": "Rick Ray", "profile_path": "/srYy1UneiJEvgxRxZViV1osorwD.jpg"}]}}
