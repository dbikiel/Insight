She lives a cozy life with her beautiful social worker girlfriend Alex (super sexy Nina Landey) until her stuffy family demands that she come home for Christmas \u2013 without Alex.Casey is a longshorewoman who seems to have everything she wants; she and her girlfriend Alex are very much in love. But there\u2019s nothing like the holidays to bring out the drama of the average family. Casey lives just across the bay from her upper crust New England family. The proximity seems no accident: Casey can\u2019t quite let go, despite her family\u2019s judgmental and inescapable hold on her otherwise independent and unconventional life. When the family reunites for Christmas, the unwrapping of presents takes a back seat to the unraveling of emotions.", "popularity": 1.992, "poster_path": "/x0kThnJkjPvlWgOlpnVEGtkvoI5.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CA", "name": "Canada"}], "release_date": "2001-06-15", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 94, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Treading Water", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.3, "vote_count": 3, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "Casey", "credit_id": "52fe46d5c3a36847f8114c91", "gender": 0, "id": 133962, "name": "Angela Redman", "order": 0, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "Alex Barrett-Rosenberg", "credit_id": "52fe46d5c3a36847f8114c95", "gender": 1, "id": 133963, "name": "Nina Landey", "order": 1, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "Mrs. Olsen", "credit_id": "52fe46d5c3a36847f8114c99", "gender": 0, "id": 133964, "name": "Annette Miller", "order": 2, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Shawn Olsen", "credit_id": "52fe46d5c3a36847f8114c9d", "gender": 2, "id": 133965, "name": "Robert Harte", "order": 3, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Andrew Olsen", "credit_id": "52fe46d5c3a36847f8114ca1", "gender": 0, "id": 133966, "name": "Shawn Nee", "order": 4, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 6, "character": "Mr. Olsen", "credit_id": "52fe46d5c3a36847f8114ca5", "gender": 2, "id": 133967, "name": "Richard Snee", "order": 5, "profile_path": "/xLloIthzN9jPqKcgVjLAUqUEvWS.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "537656ddc3a3681edb001962", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1320314, "job": "Director", "name": "Lauren Himmel", "profile_path": null}]}}
