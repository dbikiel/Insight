A riotous black comedy that's as timely today as ever, it contrasts the appalling conditions in a overcrowded London hospital with a soap opera playing on the televisions there. In an ingenious touch, the same actors appear in the \"real\" story as well as the \"TV\" one, thus blurring the distinctions even further. Jack Gould directs such outstanding British actors as Lynn Redgrave, Colin Blakely, Eleanor Bron, Jim Dale, Donald Sinden, Mervyn Johns, and, in only his second film, Bob Hoskins. The renowned Carl Davis composed the score.", "poster_path": "/8xuZcUr64R1jhTBSk9Uxa5WmFHn.jpg", "release_date": "1973-03-06", "title": "The National Health", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.3, "vote_count": 3, "popularity": 2.426}, {"id": 169541, "video": false, "vote_count": 5, "vote_average": 5.2, "title": "Miracles", "release_date": "1986-07-11", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Miracles", "genre_ids": [35], "backdrop_path": "/i2MVfh7A2LMIc4l3atLwtxZ46PC.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Miracles is a 1986 comedy film about a newly divorced couple who can't seem to get away from one another.
