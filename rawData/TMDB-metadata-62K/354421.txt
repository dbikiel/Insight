Held for decades in a psychiatric institute, Quick's confessions emerged after years working with a group of touchy feely therapists, convinced that the recovery of memories would cure patients of their criminality. In a country with a low crime rate, the nation watched with horror as Quick's confessions mounted, accounting for many of the country's unsolved murders. With testimonials from a range of people whose lives have been dominated by this story - including Quick himself - and dramatic reenactment, Brian Hill weaves a stylish noir thriller that works a treat on the big screen. What appears at first to be a tale of unimaginable evil evolves into something much more layered as Hill digs deep into the motivations behind those working closely with Quick.", "popularity": 2.876, "poster_path": "/41d2miYUuPQM8E78l7rsLlhXJJu.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 4284, "logo_path": null, "name": "Century Films", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 11486, "logo_path": null, "name": "Picturehouse Entertainment", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 6705, "logo_path": "/5uoaxZCSYuc6KEiJgEYSWzLIFAW.png", "name": "Film4 Productions", "origin_country": "GB"}, {"id": 2801, "logo_path": "/bswb1PLLsKDUXMLgy42bZtCtIde.png", "name": "Film i V\u00e4st", "origin_country": "SE"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "SE", "name": "Sweden"}, {"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "2015-08-14", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 95, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "sv", "name": "svenska"}, {"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Confessions of Thomas Quick", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 12, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 4434, "name": "interview"}, {"id": 5565, "name": "biography"}, {"id": 10714, "name": "serial killer"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 8461, "video": false, "vote_count": 1137, "vote_average": 6.5, "title": "Funny Games", "release_date": "2007-10-20", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Funny Games", "genre_ids": [80, 18, 27, 53], "backdrop_path": "/x0IvYeF88qYoKkigRjJ9CiyfY6b.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "When Ann, husband George, and son Georgie arrive at their holiday home they are visited by a pair of polite and seemingly pleasant young men.
