Star Wreck V: Lost Contact was the first film to use live actors instead of cartoons. Real sets would have cost too much, so we decided to try bluescreen, just for fun. Our expectations weren't high, but it worked. So the movie was shot against a cheap blue bed-sheet and the blue background was replaced with spaceship bridges.  The story was a parody of Star Trek: First Contact. The Korg send a ship back in time to 20th century Earth. The Kickstart, being the only functioning P-fleet ship around, has to follow.  The Korg plan to assassinate rockstar Jeffrey Cochbrane (Played by Rudi Airisto and a pair of sunglasses) and his band Dethdestro before their concert attracts the attention of Vulgars. This would stop humanity's first contact aliens and change the future. If that wasn't bad enough, all Jeff wants to do is play loud and drink too much, but now Pirk and his crew must force him to save the world...", "poster_path": "/1tiJcrQGvGi6kp2htOoEnQFSa78.jpg", "release_date": "1997-01-01", "title": "Star Wreck V: Lost Contact", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.7, "vote_count": 3, "popularity": 1.821}, {"id": 54641, "video": false, "vote_count": 5, "vote_average": 5.3, "title": "Frat House", "release_date": "1998-01-28", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Frat House", "genre_ids": [99], "backdrop_path": "/enzk9HrhSBKvLsgItZYUqACSF65.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Frat House is a documentary film exploring the darker side of fraternity life, largely filmed at Allentown, Pennsylvania's Muhlenberg College; the majority of the film was shot in the house of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity, whose charter was revoked in 2000 and reinstated in 2011.
