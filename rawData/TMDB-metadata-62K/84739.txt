His father Cenzo (Luigi Maria Burruano) lost his job after a local chemical plant closed; shortly afterward, Cenzo's wife Paola (Anita Zagaria) dumped him for a politician. Fed up, Vince travels to the beach town of Pescara and lands a job as a junior cook at a tourist resort. While there, he falls in love with Genny (Nicole Grimaudo), a waitress plagued by a phobia of traveling. Just as the romance begins to take off, Cenzo appears at Vince's doorstep demanding that his son help him get Paola back. ~ Tracie Cooper, Rovi", "popularity": 1.823, "poster_path": "/cmc9OqPhwJe8esYalP4EfvDZSAE.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2003-01-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 113, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Break Free", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 9, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [18], "id": 63275, "original_language": "it", "original_title": "Provincia meccanica", "overview": "A mentally unstable woman loses her daughter's custody to her mother.
