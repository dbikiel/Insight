Only a few old people and the poacher Panturle remain. Panturle dreams of bringing the village back to life, finding a wife, founding a family and work as a farmer. One day, the village is visited by a traveling knife-grinder, Urbain Gedemus and a young woman, Arsule. Gedemus treats Arsule like a slave, but Arsule accept this because she has nowhere to go and -we guess- her 'work' with Gedemus is the last thing that saves her from being a prostitute. When she meets Panturle and knows about his dreams, she escapes from Gedemus and decides to stay with him. Together, they start a new life, made of hard farming work but mostly of happiness to have each other - fulfilling the earlier dreams of Panturle. Can anything break the happiness of their new life?", "popularity": 3.448, "poster_path": "/7xUTqnwUY9tdqgryHTE9jGLP40q.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 19160, "logo_path": null, "name": "Les Films Marcel Pagnol", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "1937-10-28", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 127, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Harvest", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.4, "vote_count": 9, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 62566, "video": false, "vote_count": 6, "vote_average": 6.2, "title": "The Last Turning", "release_date": "1939-05-17", "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "Le Dernier Tournant", "genre_ids": [18], "backdrop_path": "/2FvHGVN011mQlHS1gfCXxfiPo8F.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Le Dernier tournant (aka The Last Turning) is a 1939 French drama film directed by Pierre Chenal, written by Charles Spaak and Henri Torr\u00e8s, based on novel \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\" by James M.
