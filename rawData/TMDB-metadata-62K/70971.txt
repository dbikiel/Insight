The film is set during the tumultuous 1960s, an era when everyone's values were turned inside out, shaken around, and reassembled. The central character is first-generation American Craig Wasson, who confounds his Yugoslavian father (Miklos Simon) by pursuing his own let-it-all-hang-out lifestyle. Wasson's best friends are athlete Jim Metzler and chubby Michael Huddleston; all pursue the affections of bewitching Jodi Thelan. Though they are obviously deeply in love with one another, Wasson and Thelan continue to foolishly avoid a long-term commitment as the sixties unfold around them. Four Friends calls for a fresher approach than the one offered by director Arthur Penn, whose handling of the material is much too pat and old-fashioned.", "popularity": 4.357, "poster_path": "/xCuGYk8j0xPAskBCifLapyk1QlV.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 11333, "logo_path": null, "name": "Geria Productions", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 1819, "logo_path": null, "name": "Cinema 77", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 1138, "logo_path": null, "name": "Filmways Pictures", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 92940, "logo_path": null, "name": "Florin", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1981-12-11", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 115, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "All the boys love Georgia...and Georgia loves all the boys!", "title": "Four Friends", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.4, "vote_count": 10, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 704, "name": "adolescence"}, {"id": 208992, "name": "1960s"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 398978, "video": false, "vote_count": 2174, "vote_average": 7.8, "title": "The Irishman", "release_date": "2019-11-01", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Irishman", "genre_ids": [80, 18, 36], "backdrop_path": "/iLLDiO4dbUfFEnRug8DuvFEl1NB.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Pennsylvania, 1956.

The winner of several festival awards, Farrebique nonetheless did not immediately result in an outpouring of financing for Rouqier's follow-up films (this was a common problem in the financially strapped French film industry of the 1940s).
