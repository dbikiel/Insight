Beginning as a black comedy, the film's mood transforms as the games played by Kaveh (director Mani Haghighi) and Leyla (Taraneh Alidoosti) become increasingly perverse, as they find inventive ways of humiliating the recipients of the cash. The immorality of the central characters is at times sickening, and their chain of lies is often as puzzling to us as they are to the townsfolk depicted onscreen. What is the relationship between the pair and why are they giving away money to the needy? Modest Reception has no easy answers nor pat resolutions - instead Haghighi takes the viewer on an intriguing ride into the dark recesses of the human spirit.", "popularity": 2.545, "poster_path": "/7hmgpMXXBDG3Map5HzOkS1MRpwz.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 13413, "logo_path": null, "name": "Hubert Bals Fund", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "IR", "name": "Iran"}], "release_date": "2013-01-02", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 100, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fa", "name": "\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Modest Reception", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.8, "vote_count": 10, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 178656, "name": "iranian"}, {"id": 236316, "name": "anarchic comedy"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/3aPaYY6V5J4dq7h2k1nXGajTdv.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 369651, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "\u062a\u0648\u0646\u0644 \u06f1\u06f8", "overview": "Tunnel 18 (Persian: \u062a\u0648\u0646\u0644 18\u200e\u200e) is a 1997 Iranian Historical drama film written and directed by Hossein Shahabi (Persian: \u062d\u0633\u06cc\u0646 \u0634\u0647\u0627\u0628\u06cc)", "poster_path": "/yVjZsfHGtBPuMtatefTEBjMuT8L.jpg", "release_date": "1997-02-13", "title": "Tunnel 18", "video": false, "vote_average": 10.0, "vote_count": 1, "popularity": 1.96}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/qlowyFrYfxex2V0k0RFTou3jXBi.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 369648, "original_language": "fa", "original_title": "\u0633\u0627\u06cc\u0647 \u0631\u0648\u0634\u0646", "overview": "Bright Shadow (Persian: \u0633\u0627\u064a\u0647 \u0631\u0648\u0634\u0646\u200e\u200e) is a 1997 Iranian drama film written and directed by Hossein Shahabi (Persian: \u062d\u0633\u06cc\u0646 \u0634\u0647\u0627\u0628\u06cc)", "poster_path": "/2tVs4oXrxvh4TKttZuCiGd3TYLo.jpg", "release_date": "1997-10-02", "title": "Bright Shadow", "video": false, "vote_average": 10.0, "vote_count": 1, "popularity": 1.374}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/4lQ5vgQzbJVV2PtRqsMJsvn2z52.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 369709, "original_language": "fa", "original_title": "\u0622\u0633\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0648\u0631", "overview": "Elevator (Persian: \u0622\u0633\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0648\u0631\u200e\u200e) is a 1995 social drama Iranian film, written and directed by Hossein Shahabi (Persian: \u062d\u0633\u06cc\u0646 \u0634\u0647\u0627\u0628\u06cc)", "poster_path": "/nD1899jMqwY3AQfwz4TOEjMsyYa.jpg", "release_date": "1995-06-23", "title": "Elevator", "video": false, "vote_average": 10.0, "vote_count": 1, "popularity": 0.675}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/teQVCEu4niGIGOMka4ZpIuOXF1D.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 369655, "original_language": "fa", "original_title": "\u0631\u062f \u067e\u0627\u06cc \u0646\u0648\u0631", "overview": "The Traces of Light (Persian: \u0631\u062f \u067e\u0627\u064a \u0646\u0648\u0631\u200e\u200e) is a 1996 Iranian drama film written and directed by Hossein Shahabi (Persian: \u062d\u0633\u06cc\u0646 \u0634\u0647\u0627\u0628\u06cc)", "poster_path": "/m7kiJay3blqth9nx3FLLupm659Z.jpg", "release_date": "1996-08-20", "title": "The Traces of Light", "video": false, "vote_average": 10.0, "vote_count": 1, "popularity": 0.705}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/yLezxwESGhEu5H6lDwIHdGHHuBE.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 369550, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "\u0628\u0647 \u062e\u0627\u0637\u0631 \u0645\u0647\u062f\u06cc", "overview": "For the Sake of mahdi (Persian: \u0628\u062e\u0627\u0637\u0631 \u0645\u0647\u062f\u064a\u200e\u200e) is a 2012 Iranian social drama film directed by Hossein Shahabi.
