With the help of their techno-savvy neighbors JEFF and PHILLIP GUY, \"The Guys,\" Stone and Ed set out on a quest to find Stone's mother, JANE DOE. After the first two Jane Does on their list don't turn out to be the one, the two less than genius brothers make their way to Mexico, and to the last Jane on the list. Along the way, this wacky duo encounters a cast of zany characters and one, out of this world adventure. By the time its all over Stone &amp; Ed will have found their way into the middle of a dangerous game of cat and mouse between Mexico's largest drug lord, SENOR GORDO, and the CIA's most incompetent agents to ever leave Langley; THE MAN IN THE YELLOW HAT and his little partner, CURIOUS JORGE. Between mistaken identities of cases, and cases of mistaken identities, Stone &amp; Ed are in for the trip of their lives.", "popularity": 1.282, "poster_path": "/hArFGVaW3boknvsa0EPaDk92tJO.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 10663, "logo_path": null, "name": "Flashback Entertainment", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2008-01-08", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "Life Is Better When You're Stone & Ed.", "title": "Stone & Ed", "video": false, "vote_average": 1.5, "vote_count": 2, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "Ed Schwartz", "credit_id": "52fe4b9cc3a368484e1914fd", "gender": 2, "id": 57404, "name": "Travis Wester", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/3pRPTZ7jhuMJzING7eouoFoqinQ.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "Preston \"Stone\" Schwartz", "credit_id": "52fe4b9cc3a368484e191501", "gender": 2, "id": 133591, "name": "Ian Reed Kesler", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/rTmay9ruuuQw8LNzMVbz9r68KA5.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 8, "character": "Mara", "credit_id": "52fe4b9cc3a368484e191519", "gender": 1, "id": 83352, "name": "Mircea Monroe", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/b27UZlc4VBwVbOiJSbkyfnfLWZP.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Moustache", "credit_id": "52fe4b9cc3a368484e191505", "gender": 2, "id": 1096126, "name": "Jules Douglas", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/oCtYP7RZqMMWIiSpwxmv2zHAlCa.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Senor Gordo", "credit_id": "52fe4b9cc3a368484e191509", "gender": 2, "id": 6734, "name": "Ken Davitian", "order": 4, "profile_path": "/6PfsHGDYl017vcP8CEM6rrx6wWl.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 9, "character": "Hot Girl", "credit_id": "5585a063c3a368274c000768", "gender": 1, "id": 1224426, "name": "Alison MacInnis", "order": 5, "profile_path": "/1uX7v48HcpIzdKjIwXN5RDtEDf1.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 10, "character": "Man In The Yellow Hat", "credit_id": "5c3abe1f9251414dce74d947", "gender": 2, "id": 35701, "name": "Dave Sheridan", "order": 6, "profile_path": "/pNP7NGCjfSn6nHpoLbCOf7RsexL.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4b9cc3a368484e19150f", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1096128, "job": "Director", "name": "Adam Meyerowitz", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe4b9cc3a368484e191515", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 1096129, "job": "Writer", "name": "Dave Hellman", "profile_path": null}]}}
