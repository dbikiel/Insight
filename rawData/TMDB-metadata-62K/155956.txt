The film takes place mostly in a surrealistic fantasy around the time of the execution of Joan of Arc. Joan of Arc, played by Ingrid Bergman, is being burned alive for heresy. In a kind of dream state, she departs from her body and begins to look back upon her life. She begins this journey in a depressed and demoralized state. However, a priest appears to help guide her. First, he shows her those that accused her in the guise of animal characters, in order to show her their true nature. Then, he shows her the good that she has performed for people. In the end, she is proud of what she has done and is ready to face the flames.", "popularity": 1.805, "poster_path": "/lZB9UbrvzAxV9cIOSJC0rTD8JJa.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 1477, "logo_path": null, "name": "Franco London Films", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 52852, "logo_path": null, "name": "Produzioni Cinematografiche Associate", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}, {"iso_3166_1": "IT", "name": "Italy"}], "release_date": "1954-12-20", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 80, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "it", "name": "Italiano"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Joan of Arc at the Stake", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 5, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 4344, "name": "musical"}, {"id": 5565, "name": "biography"}, {"id": 190855, "name": "joan of arc"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 504608, "video": false, "vote_count": 1666, "vote_average": 7.4, "title": "Rocketman", "release_date": "2019-05-22", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Rocketman", "genre_ids": [18, 10402], "backdrop_path": "/sZZJ42GrWKxSOfcrpI2TSFQa0AQ.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "The story of Elton John's life, from his years as a prodigy at the Royal Academy of Music through his influential and enduring musical partnership with Bernie Taupin.", "poster_path": "/f4FF18ia7yTvHf2izNrHqBmgH8U.jpg", "popularity": 27.709}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/3pZj7AHo8YvWb1TRhD8tdTwc7Dh.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 31900, "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "Gainsbourg (vie h\u00e9ro\u00efque)", "overview": "A glimpse at the life of French singer Serge Gainsbourg, from growing up in 1940s Nazi-occupied Paris through his successful song-writing years in the 1960s to his death in 1991 at the age of 62.", "poster_path": "/psrukBNrMfE00ibI2G1D4eV0oYS.jpg", "release_date": "2010-01-20", "title": "Gainsbourg: A Heroic Life", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 162, "popularity": 8.575}, {"id": 316029, "video": false, "vote_count": 5853, "vote_average": 8.0, "title": "The Greatest Showman", "release_date": "2017-12-20", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Greatest Showman", "genre_ids": [18], "backdrop_path": "/zpq404Sk7qQ7N4x3xOeNgp74GtU.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "The story of American showman P.T.
