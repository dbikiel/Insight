Driven by a commitment to bear witness to the wars of our time after the events of 9/11, Chris was among the first in a new generation of war photographers since Vietnam. HONDROS explores the complexities inherent in covering more than a decade of conflict, while trying to maintain a normal life. It also examines the unknowable calculus involved in making split-second life and death decisions -- before, during and after his photos were made. Chris was killed in Libya in 2011, but he left a lasting impact on his profession that is still felt today.", "popularity": 4.292, "poster_path": "/eRk9EmZY93TAvBWu5wWz534ISYP.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 89261, "logo_path": "/pEIvnw8XMErTLclRxfKc6lyyv3c.png", "name": "Nine Stories Productions", "origin_country": "US"}, {"id": 2266, "logo_path": "/owzVs2mguyyJ3vIn7EbgowpUPnk.png", "name": "Bold Films", "origin_country": "US"}, {"id": 89260, "logo_path": null, "name": "Fox Tale Films", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "IQ", "name": "Iraq"}, {"iso_3166_1": "LR", "name": "Liberia"}, {"iso_3166_1": "LY", "name": "Libyan Arab Jamahiriya"}, {"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2018-03-02", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 86, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Hondros", "video": false, "vote_average": 8.1, "vote_count": 9, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/fvc6xGo60iGHqqeToc0wzxY2LO2.jpg", "genre_ids": [80, 18], "id": 514185, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Savage Youth", "overview": "Six young lives collide in the most horrific and twisted of ways.
