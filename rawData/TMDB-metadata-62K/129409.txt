The camera zooms in into the boy's mind and a slow, sad waltz (i.e.\"Valse Triste\") accompanies images of a locomotive, a miner, the globe, the sky, a sheep heard, etc. Disparate elements, but if one concentrates only at the movement of the figures, one can perceive a commotion, slowly livening up: The starting wheels of the heavy locomotive, the tired miner pushing the heavy cart of coal bricks, the globe smoothly turning around and around, the clouds imperceptibly floating in the sky, the sheep idly moving in the herd, etc.  We reach the first climax when a mannequin opens her coat like a flower. The second big crescendo spurts out from a \"water hose\", after watching schoolgirls doing gymnastics for quite a while. A sad, but nostalgic aftertaste lingers in the end when funeral cars drive away through a flooded area\u2026", "poster_path": "/fsLJMk1dPfzr5qXd3IRSmZRxpX6.jpg", "release_date": "1977-06-01", "title": "Valse Triste", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 9, "popularity": 2.37}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/doPKNozhSlZSicdsuFk6RS4CXzF.jpg", "genre_ids": [99, 10402], "id": 143631, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "T.G.: Psychic Rally in Heaven", "overview": "An experimental film of the group Throbbing Gristle in concert.", "poster_path": "/anLgiu8KaRxtT9HE59xPRblyPs4.jpg", "release_date": "1981-12-31", "title": "T.G.: Psychic Rally in Heaven", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.0, "vote_count": 10, "popularity": 1.792}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [35], "id": 148626, "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "Barres", "overview": "The 1984 short Barres celebrates the ingenious ways one can get onto the Paris Metro without paying.", "poster_path": "/6nvHpShsZc8nWtKTBPRIvoXqhbh.jpg", "release_date": "1984-12-31", "title": "Barres", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 8, "popularity": 2.006}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [16], "id": 209754, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "70", "overview": "\"Made with spray paint and hand-cut stencils, this film was an attempt at maximum plastic intensity\u2026 Places Breer for the first time among the major colorists of the avant-garde.\" \u2013 P.
