More than 10,000 additional tons join them every year. It is the most dangerous waste man has ever produced. Waste that requires storage in a safe final repository for hundreds of thousands of years. Out of reach of humanity and other living creatures. The question is, where? Together with Swiss-British nuclear physicist Charles McCombie, who has been searching for a safe final storage site for highly radioactive nuclear waste for thirty-five years, director Edgar Hagen investigates the limitations and contradictions involved in this project of global significance. Supporters and opponents of nuclear energy struggle for solutions whilst dogmatic worldviews are assailed by doubt", "popularity": 0.6, "poster_path": "/p6a0umRehaGhGbEdFjdQriJRgBI.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2013-10-10", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 100, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Journey to the Safest Place on Earth", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 2, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 195331, "name": "nuclear waste"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 651694, "video": false, "vote_count": 0, "vote_average": 0.0, "title": "Wolsong", "release_date": "2019-12-12", "original_language": "ko", "original_title": "\uc6d4\uc131", "genre_ids": [99], "backdrop_path": "/2loEee2bZJQ8MrBmildtJioXQY1.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "", "poster_path": "/bVZIJUXR0rZB53w0QAWucUv6mWY.jpg", "popularity": 0.808}, {"id": 23730, "video": false, "vote_count": 110, "vote_average": 5.4, "title": "C.H.U.D.", "release_date": "1984-08-31", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "C.H.U.D.", "genre_ids": [27, 878], "backdrop_path": "/56SASZQBZEDgrHwWXR8Jm0wTnkg.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A rash of bizarre murders in New York City seems to point to a group of grotesquely deformed vagrants living in the sewers.

The resulting radioactive waste contaminated numerous locations in the St. Louis area some of which have not been cleaned up 70 years after the end of World War II.
