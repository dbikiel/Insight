The film centres around Pilot Officer Peter Penrose, fresh out of a training unit, who joins the squadron, and quickly discovers about life during war time. He falls for Iris, a young girl who lives at the local hotel, but he becomes disillusioned about marriage, when the squadron commander dies in a raid, and leaves his wife, the hotel manageress, with a young son to bring up. As the war progresses, Penross comes to terms that he has survived, while others have been killed.", "poster_path": "/xLaHR11zthm6pd3sXq4clbgD2Ej.jpg", "release_date": "1945-06-16", "title": "The Way to the Stars", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.7, "vote_count": 10, "popularity": 3.464}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/pX8mnzHyPwzFU1qmxUEouOII2ZS.jpg", "genre_ids": [37], "id": 60565, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Coroner Creek", "overview": "A man is bent on taking revenge on those responsible for his fianc\u00e9e's death.", "poster_path": "/vNuIDlaJhF6omwLBvOumasRwZp7.jpg", "release_date": "1948-07-01", "title": "Coroner Creek", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.3, "vote_count": 11, "popularity": 3.91}], "total_pages": 2, "total_results": 40}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 2, "character": "Capt.
