The criminal psychologist Claudia Meinert notices contradictions in her conversation with the parents of the missing child. In particular Nikolas' mother appears to be hiding something. When a video of the missing Nikolas surfaces, showing him tied up in a cellar, the trail leads to his school. The 13-year-old Leon and Mathilda strike the psychologist as conspicuous and provocative. Shortly afterwards, Meinert encounters the children with Nikolas' parents at the local swimming pool and her suspicions are confirmed: the parents are entangled in an insidious father-mother-child game with the possible suspects Leon and Mathilda. Now it is up to the psychologist to resolve the dark mystery of Nikolas' disappearance and save the child.", "poster_path": "/ApzH0tl7KRcxgIDFvRTkO0ksUbE.jpg", "popularity": 2.5}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/5ZeNSCGhjPcnjMUA3W2e8awCifc.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 53], "id": 41655, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "La corsa dell'innocente", "overview": "The boy Vito is a portrait of beauty and wide-eyed innocence spawned from a violent family of kidnapers and murderers in the South of Italy.
