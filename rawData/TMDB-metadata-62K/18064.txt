It recounts the history of the Second World War from a Japanese perspective, combining original colour film with letters and diaries written by Japanese people. It tells the story of a nation at war from the diverse perspectives of those who lived through it: the leaders and the ordinary people, the oppressors and the victims, the guilty and the innocent.  Until recently, it was believed that no colour film of Japan existed prior to 1945. But specialist research has now unearthed a remarkable colour record from as early as the 1930s.  For eight years the Japanese fought what they believed was a Holy War that became a fight to the death. Japan's War In Colour shows how militarism took hold of the Japanese people; describes why Japan felt compelled to attack the West; explains what drove the Japanese to resist the Allies for so long; and, finally, reveals how they dealt with the shame of defeat.", "popularity": 2.172, "poster_path": "/lhQKhomgT2Pjuay2AmcK1OIzMzF.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 12060, "logo_path": null, "name": "TWI", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 17195, "logo_path": null, "name": "Carlton UK Productions", "origin_country": "GB"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "2003-12-31", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 151, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "The story of the Japanese during the Second World War and the rise and fall of the Japanese Empire 1931-1945.", "title": "Japan's War In Colour", "video": false, "vote_average": 9.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 233, "name": "japan"}, {"id": 1956, "name": "world war ii"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/qtD2lFLG5T7L8flbKSEIoSqcslI.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 10752], "id": 7862, "original_language": "de", "original_title": "Die F\u00e4lscher", "overview": "The story Jewish counterfeiter, Salomon Sorowitsch, coerced into assisting the Nazi operation of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp during World War II.", "poster_path": "/bRQddrgVemZtFdnrPy9AxTpkhpj.jpg", "release_date": "2007-02-09", "title": "The Counterfeiters", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.4, "vote_count": 261, "popularity": 12.463}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/pKawqrtCBMmxarft7o1LbEynys7.jpg", "genre_ids": [10752, 18, 28], "id": 228150, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Fury", "overview": "In the last months of World War II, as the Allies make their final push in the European theatre, a battle-hardened U.S. Army sergeant named 'Wardaddy' commands a Sherman tank called 'Fury' and its five-man crew on a deadly mission behind enemy lines.
