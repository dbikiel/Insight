Actually, Rod\u2019s been bored with nothing to do, and Katherine misses her kids back home, especially with Christmas right around the corner. At least they\u2019ve made friends with their new neighbor Lisa, who\u2019s a golden retriever fan like them \u2013 Rod and Katherine\u2019s dog Jake has three new puppy playmates, Mario, Luigi and Pasquale. But when Jake and the puppies take off during a walk with Lisa and interrupt a wedding proposal, Lisa is mortified to discover the proposer is none other than her lifelong-friend-turned-boyfriend-turned-ex, David. Everyone can see that David and Lisa are meant to be together. Everyone, that is, except for David and Lisa. Now, with David\u2019s wedding approaching, they must decide whether to leave their love in the past, or to give it another chance. With a little help from Rod and Katherine and four lovable pups, it\u2019s sure to be a Christmas to remember.", "poster_path": "/aoap5LblJlSo8jAugGARiR98JLY.jpg", "release_date": "2011-11-15", "title": "3 Holiday Tails", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.8, "vote_count": 19, "popularity": 3.909}, {"id": 26847, "video": false, "vote_count": 30, "vote_average": 5.0, "title": "Santa Baby", "release_date": "2006-12-10", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Santa Baby", "genre_ids": [35, 10751, 10770], "backdrop_path": "/1uLZJgtIKQpTh9w0K14NX5j0OVB.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Mary Class is a highly successful business executive - who just happens to be the daughter of Santa Claus.
