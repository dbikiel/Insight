Both the surreal story by Vladimir Gubarev, together with the 1964 film, written in a Through The Looking Glass style. Alice-type Soviet girl, named Olya meets her counterpart Yalo, while looking into the mirror. Yalo is an absolute antipode to Olya, for example where Olya is precise and neat, Yalo is absent-minded, careless, etc. The explicit plot relates to Olya learning to see herself differently, but this occurs through an experience in the Kingdom of Crooked Mirrors which serves as a mechanism for commenting on the ability of a society to manufacture a false reality.", "poster_path": "/5noVt8y6OAHUBJX43z7vz3RAgr5.jpg", "release_date": "1963-05-05", "title": "Kingdom of Crooked Mirrors", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 19, "popularity": 2.454}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 9}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "Death (voice)", "credit_id": "52fe47869251416c7509c95f", "gender": 2, "id": 113, "name": "Christopher Lee", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/yzE2U4sS46sVRyCUKpgs3lYZaMy.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Mustrum Ridcully (voice)", "credit_id": "52fe47869251416c7509c96f", "gender": 2, "id": 10654, "name": "Graham Crowden", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/wyGg5BXqE1N8oG1Ag82I3yHYQdW.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Imp y Celyn (voice)", "credit_id": "52fe47869251416c7509c973", "gender": 0, "id": 219741, "name": "Andy Hockley", "order": 2, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 6, "character": "Susan Sto Helit (voice)", "credit_id": "52fe47869251416c7509c977", "gender": 1, "id": 141946, "name": "Debra Gillett", "order": 3, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 7, "character": "Mort (voice)", "credit_id": "52fe47869251416c7509c97b", "gender": 2, "id": 26862, "name": "Neil Morrissey", "order": 4, "profile_path": "/m4JIPGagmc0c6Psk2a2TdRHdskX.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 8, "character": "Asphalt (voice)", "credit_id": "52fe47869251416c7509c97f", "gender": 2, "id": 1121491, "name": "Bernard Wrigley", "order": 5, "profile_path": "/ymAtIv3TR2uDoHBsp8f9USbJj3Y.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 9, "character": "Albert (voice)", "credit_id": "52fe47869251416c7509c983", "gender": 2, "id": 22171, "name": "Bryan Pringle", "order": 6, "profile_path": "/ylwlvUJf68fsxLgdPZIX8pWmS2J.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe47869251416c7509c965", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1121490, "job": "Director", "name": "Jean Flynn", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe47869251416c7509c96b", "department": "Writing", "gender": 2, "id": 95903, "job": "Novel", "name": "Terry Pratchett", "profile_path": "/6zmAMtmgr0wEx7fBX5qWLDmCUPD.jpg"}]}}
