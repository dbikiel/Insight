Kuvia Suomesta", "overview": "F*** Off! shows no false respect towards the authorities in its impudent and candid reportage of the developing country/welfare state Finland. It is a cinematic parallel to Donner's New Book of Our Land (1967). The travelogue focuses especially on Finland's outsiders, low-paid workers and the unemployed. In desolate provinces, the inhabitants of a cold and barren country either humbly abide their fate, choose to move to Sweden or take refuge in excessive drinking. These images are accompanied by protest songs based on Donner's own prose and the lyrics of poet Jarkko Laine. Perkele is embodied in big business and the political elite.The jagged (anti)aesthetics of the film correspond to the underground movement and the radical politics of the time. The camera agilely penetrates everyday life. Though opposed to censorship, Fuck Off! itself transgresses the boundaries of privacy.", "popularity": 1.243, "poster_path": "/iVIlSoCJKSVW46CcP8RMWVWYEEV.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 38212, "logo_path": null, "name": "FJ Filmi", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FI", "name": "Finland"}], "release_date": "1971-03-19", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 96, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fi", "name": "suomi"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Fuck Off!
