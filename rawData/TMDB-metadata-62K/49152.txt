Part I, by Pasolini, is a denunciation of the offenses of Western culture, particularly those against colonized Africa. It is at the same time a chronicle of the liberation and independence of the former African colonies, portraying these peoples as the new protagonists of the world stage, holding up Marxism as their \"salvation\", and suggesting that their \"innocent ferocity\" will be the new religion of the era. Guareschi's part, by contrast, constitutes a defense of Western civilization and a word of hope, couched in traditional Christian terms, for man's future.", "popularity": 1.523, "poster_path": "/59iEEwJHK2Bm0jbPMWKsvxzejRp.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 112789, "logo_path": null, "name": "Opus Films", "origin_country": "IT"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "IT", "name": "Italy"}], "release_date": "1963-04-13", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 104, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "it", "name": "Italiano"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "La Rabbia", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.6, "vote_count": 10, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [27], "id": 215672, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Frank Stein", "overview": "Filmed before Arrebato, Zulueta\u2019s Frank Stein is a very personal reading of horror cult classic Frankenstein (1931), filmed directly from its television broadcast and reducing Whale\u2019s original to only three packed and dizzying minutes, during which the intimate monster evolves at an unusual rate. \u2014Impakt.nl", "poster_path": "/dA5CSPe4LdG13DiPvvcnoBnNrR7.jpg", "release_date": "1972-01-01", "title": "Frank Stein", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.3, "vote_count": 3, "popularity": 0.73}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/9EvwpWZYzl5QxW7rz4pnF6ivqay.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 19930, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Appunti per un'Orestiade africana", "overview": "The director presents takes and scenes filmed on location in Africa for a film-that-never-was, a black Oresteia.", "poster_path": "/jjWcVx2nJS27hufHAv3uW41r6vU.jpg", "release_date": "1970-11-29", "title": "Notes Towards an African Orestes", "video": false, "vote_average": 8.2, "vote_count": 6, "popularity": 1.475}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [18], "id": 222560, "original_language": "es", "original_title": "Aro Tolbukhin - en la mente del asesino", "overview": "After a strict upbringing and the death of his beloved sister, Aro Tolbukhin leaves Hungary for Guatemala.
