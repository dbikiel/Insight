Freewheeling and adventurous, she is also irresponsible and reckless, pushing away the timid and the cautious, yet always falling for the romantic dreams of the love-conquers-minor-details-like-my-lover\u2019s-married-status variety. After a spectacular break-up with a co-worker, Eun-jin shares a cab ride with Kim Hyeon-seok, a nerdish, awkward young man. Against all odds, they begin a courtship and eventually decide to get married. One night, however, Eun-jin finds a suspicious text message sent to her paramour\u2019s smartphone. Angered, she enlists the help of her female cop friend So-young and her doofus ex-marine brother Eun-gyul to get to the bottom of what she suspects is Hyeon-seok\u2019s two-timing affair. What she finds out, however, is something else altogether.", "popularity": 0.6, "poster_path": "/4vwNhz2JLZKfg6gIoO26jK4hnjb.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2014-08-20", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 93, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ko", "name": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4/\uc870\uc120\ub9d0"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "My Ordinary Love Story", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.4, "vote_count": 4, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 0, "character": "Hyun-suk", "credit_id": "5568ee909251416b0a0002fd", "gender": 2, "id": 1299516, "name": "Song Sae-byuk", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/jxMDfNq7o6SMEX6E6oSLcWit7q3.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 1, "character": "Eun-Jin", "credit_id": "5568eec4c3a368547600031d", "gender": 1, "id": 235338, "name": "Kang Ye-won", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/n6DfSR9AHDmxk0xQdvU3rLUGVdL.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "So-Young", "credit_id": "5568ef1c925141338f0000b8", "gender": 0, "id": 125731, "name": "Grina Park", "order": 3, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "Park Eun-Gyeol", "credit_id": "5568ef3f9251416b040002f8", "gender": 0, "id": 1256357, "name": "Kim Hyun-joon", "order": 4, "profile_path": "/r1K9ndjIzwcz0idx8hWtlx4WM99.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "5c51db979251410e246271c7", "department": "Sound", "gender": 2, "id": 69085, "job": "Original Music Composer", "name": "Dalpalan", "profile_path": "/tGH9zerISvma1JfyL1bCSthNcWD.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "5568f0b99251416afc000350", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 1471895, "job": "Director", "name": "Lee Kwon", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5dc5958c9c24fc0015bef5f5", "department": "Writing", "gender": 2, "id": 1471895, "job": "Writer", "name": "Lee Kwon", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5c7646ac925141689256805b", "department": "Camera", "gender": 0, "id": 2251764, "job": "Director of Photography", "name": "Baek Yoon-seuk", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5d074dd9925141131bbd4664", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 2340097, "job": "Original Story", "name": "Han Sang-un", "profile_path": null}]}}
