Mitchell is fascinated with this Harvard grad and writes a 1942 piece about him, \"Professor Seagull,\" bringing Gould some celebrity and an invitation to join the Greenwich Village Ravens, a poetry club he's often crashed.

Weiss gives a good accounting of himself in his first feature-length effort Amongst Friends. The film is set in an affluent Long Island neighborhood, the home of boyhood chums Patrick McGaw, Steve Parlavecchio, and Joseph Lindsey.

Events snowball into a climactic life-or-death drug deal, which threatens to end in disaster when one of the boys capriciously pulls a double cross.
