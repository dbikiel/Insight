His team is assembling at the lab and he needs to report. His wife Addison, a TV news reporter, is also summoned to work to do a piece on the tornado for the morning news. Ethan realizes the conditions are ripe for more tornadoes. Although he and his wife have been having marriage problems, he calls her and begs her to put the warning out, but the station's slick meteorologist thinks it was an isolated incident. Addison tries to get him to change his mind, but he won't -- because it's Christmas time and he does not want to be a Scrooge with some hypothetical news. When a tornado levels the Walker's house on Christmas Eve, Ethan and his wife must come together to help save others and rescue their missing children.", "poster_path": "/f5NP3hA98IMlYw2l823J9Eg5ICr.jpg", "popularity": 4.01}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 14}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 0, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "56840bb392514132db0160b1", "gender": 2, "id": 299743, "name": "Sebastian Maniscalco", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/9O5KZNiK6KCIoR15bjByvxQqJ4R.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "56840bd6c3a36828f500e052", "department": "Crew", "gender": 0, "id": 106520, "job": "Cinematography", "name": "Graham Futerfas", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "56840be1c3a36860750170b5", "department": "Editing", "gender": 0, "id": 77050, "job": "Editor", "name": "Dave Harrison", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "56840befc3a3685f89003be5", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 114493, "job": "Producer", "name": "John Bravakis", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "56840bfb9251417def0182fb", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 77043, "job": "Executive Producer", "name": "Judi Brown-Marmel", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "56840c06c3a3682abc011c9a", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 1555797, "job": "Producer", "name": "Lana Gomez", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "56840c1692514132db0160be", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 77045, "job": "Executive Producer", "name": "Robert Hartmann", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "56840c219251414f63011768", "department": "Production", "gender": 2, "id": 299743, "job": "Executive Producer", "name": "Sebastian Maniscalco", "profile_path": "/9O5KZNiK6KCIoR15bjByvxQqJ4R.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "56840c30c3a3684bcc0196bd", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 185674, "job": "Producer", "name": "Chris Mazzilli", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "56840c3c92514132db0160c6", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 77047, "job": "Executive Producer", "name": "Stu Schreiberg", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "56840c499251412e520168e9", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 1099926, "job": "Supervising Producer", "name": "Neil A.
