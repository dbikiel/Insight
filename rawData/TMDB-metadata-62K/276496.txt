At the end of that film, set at the conclusion of World War II, the young Valerka was striving hard to overcome the inertia of just getting by, along with his sometime friend Galiya. In this one, he is adjusting to Galiya's death and is back in school and is living with his mother, a prostitute. After a girl at the school is found to have been gang-raped, the headmaster chooses Valerka to be one of the scapegoats, though he had nothing to do with the deed. The punishment seems mild enough, he was simply expelled from school. However, after quarrelling with his mother about the incident, he takes to the road, and discovers a society so bleak, degraded and hopeless that it is a wonder he remained alive.", "poster_path": "/tdW2kiP8010nGmIPiuMzYdyOLHe.jpg", "release_date": "1992-05-26", "title": "An Independent Life", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.5, "vote_count": 4, "popularity": 2.17}, {"id": 308077, "video": false, "vote_count": 35, "vote_average": 5.6, "title": "Nasty Baby", "release_date": "2015-02-08", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Nasty Baby", "genre_ids": [35, 18], "backdrop_path": "/p4pDPWWdxhRLHTe0EOeiEcBKueW.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Nasty Baby centers around a Brooklyn couple, Freddy and his boyfriend Mo, who are trying to have a baby with the help of their best friend, Polly.
