Our protagonist dreams of becoming a bus driver in order to cruise down quiet country lanes and connect with nature, her young charges and their parents. But her idyllic view of her new job is sorely tested after she meets her surly boss, named Killer, and discovers that winding roads can prove treacherous in winter, especially with a faulty clutch. Through her cheeky humour and oblique look at the reality of people living in the Quebec countryside, Tali delivers a film that is unique, witty and touching.  - Written by NFB", "poster_path": "/uPTpDYwYdv5SRY4kNiv9xoMe7BO.jpg", "popularity": 1.692}], "total_pages": 2, "total_results": 35}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 0, "character": "Feda", "credit_id": "5525cd29c3a3687e11002a4a", "gender": 1, "id": 1450433, "name": "Layla Alizada", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/kr31uOeWsmK1L8XaWFby6DYDbda.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 13, "character": "Dr. Nasir", "credit_id": "5525cd529251417248002aee", "gender": 2, "id": 103330, "name": "Navid Negahban", "order": 14, "profile_path": "/cPsYncbHK7J76Sm4bc1rtgRh5qf.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 14, "character": "Jalal", "credit_id": "5525cdbe925141118a000d39", "gender": 0, "id": 1393236, "name": "Alain Washnevsky", "order": 15, "profile_path": "/dBAYXqkVb0Y7MbXQjViGpNpTItS.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 15, "character": "Gulab", "credit_id": "5525cdd4c3a36857ae00063c", "gender": 0, "id": 1349338, "name": "Mustafa Haidari", "order": 16, "profile_path": "/2uQ0tpbHbR59nmEYNJBMjlmMPtM.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 16, "character": "Sergeant McCloud", "credit_id": "5525cde4c3a3687e03002633", "gender": 2, "id": 211675, "name": "Jesse Luken", "order": 17, "profile_path": "/3Xl6xODhCx8GoXdg4R2lZpsDR26.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "5525cfc59251411d2f0002b0", "department": "Costume & Make-Up", "gender": 0, "id": 1285741, "job": "Costume Design", "name": "Ambre Wrigley", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5525cfe192514171b400048d", "department": "Costume & Make-Up", "gender": 0, "id": 1286562, "job": "Makeup Department Head", "name": "Lauren Bencomo", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5525cf9a92514171b400047f", "department": "Art", "gender": 0, "id": 1372083, "job": "Production Design", "name": "Benji Cox", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5525ce34925141727600297b", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1451750, "job": "Director", "name": "Henry Hughes", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5525ce5cc3a3683c5000026e", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 1451750, "job": "Writer", "name": "Henry Hughes", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5525ce74c3a36857ae000653", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 1451750, "job": "Story", "name": "Henry Hughes", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5525cec9c3a3687df30027a3", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 1451751, "job": "Story", "name": "Dawn DeVoe", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5525cef7c3a3687e0e002a4b", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 1451752, "job": "Line Producer", "name": "Jo Henriquez", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5525cf08c3a3687df8002608", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 1451753, "job": "Executive Producer", "name": "Mitchell Sandler", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5525cf409251411d2f000299", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 1451754, "job": "Producer", "name": "Michael Steiner", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5525cf51c3a3687df800261b", "department": "Sound", "gender": 0, "id": 1451755, "job": "Music", "name": "Omar Fadel", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5525cf62925141118a000d7c", "department": "Crew", "gender": 0, "id": 1451756, "job": "Cinematography", "name": "Kee Kyung", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5525cf78c3a3687e03002662", "department": "Editing", "gender": 0, "id": 1451757, "job": "Editor", "name": "Anisha Acharya", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5525cf83c3a3683c50000294", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 1451758, "job": "Casting", "name": "Becky Silverman", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5525cfa8c3a3686b17000ee6", "department": "Art", "gender": 0, "id": 1451759, "job": "Set Decoration", "name": "Lizzie Boyle", "profile_path": null}]}}
