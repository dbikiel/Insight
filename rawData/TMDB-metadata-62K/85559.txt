Olga (Audrey Campbell) is a woman who, working with \"the Syndicate\" (a criminal network that encompasses the local mafia and several Russian and Chinese communist operatives), oversees a stable of women who do double duty as prostitutes and drug pushers. Olga is a cruel woman who will tolerate no misbehavior among her charges (many of whom are addicted to \"the Big H\" and work for her to feed their habits), and subjects them to periodic torture sessions when she feels they aren't living up to her expectations. When Olga discovers that one of her girls has turned informant, she takes it upon herself to beat the truth out of the women until she finds out who has betrayed her, leading several embittered hookers and addicts to turn against their cruel mistress...though Olga ends up having the last word.", "poster_path": "/3WMFPO9dJ2m6JggAtQ5PYBERac9.jpg", "release_date": "1964-09-30", "title": "Olga's Girls", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.2, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 2.267}, {"id": 107547, "video": false, "vote_count": 4, "vote_average": 4.8, "title": "The Assassination of Ryoma", "release_date": "1974-08-02", "original_language": "ja", "original_title": "\u7adc\u99ac\u6697\u6bba", "genre_ids": [35, 18], "backdrop_path": "/nlJqUr9MKEe6mACFtI1NILxU3W.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Story of the last three days in the life of Sakamoto Ryoma (1836-1867), imperial loyalist who tried to unite the Choshu and Satsuma clans and prepared the way for the Meiji Restoration (1868).", "poster_path": "/9aCGm25m1MPLmyjSus7L6ft3wtP.jpg", "popularity": 1.532}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/cwrtdr2KJmdcbnCdOmmStNkhC65.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 125775, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Back of Beyond", "overview": "This 1954 classic follows an outback mailman as he travels along the Birdsville Track.", "poster_path": "/tMlFURV3f4EjRi03DHUkJis7zra.jpg", "release_date": "1954-05-05", "title": "The Back of Beyond", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 1.097}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99], "id": 163230, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Bridges-Go-Round", "overview": "York City's various bridges transform into an urban jungle (jazz version) or an alien landscape (electro-acoustic version).", "poster_path": "/e8yQRfDG94rmH9fBLL4XBKMwbfC.jpg", "release_date": "1958-04-25", "title": "Bridges-Go-Round", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.1, "vote_count": 9, "popularity": 0.963}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [18, 10751], "id": 119981, "original_language": "sv", "original_title": "Gunnar Hedes saga", "overview": "Gunnar Hede is raised by a strict mother, who wants him to become respectable to match his family\u2019s wealth.
