It displays the atmosphere of the late Israeli 50s from the view of young boy Alex, just becoming 13. His mom is the classic \"Polish Mother\", his school friends are young hustlers dreaming of nude girls, his schoolmaster is a nervous Russian immigrant. The street speech is full of Polish, Russian, and Farsi slang, full of the small talk that had later entered the everyday speech. The soundtrack, which is quite remarkable, is built solely on the American music of the period. Everyone in the feature finds one's love and happiness.", "popularity": 3.726, "poster_path": "/otRH11Oz54PT1jdMGwBQQ0u8hMn.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "IL", "name": "Israel"}], "release_date": "1986-01-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 88, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "he", "name": "\u05e2\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Alex Is Lovesick", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 8, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 20619, "video": false, "vote_count": 9, "vote_average": 7.2, "title": "Operation Grandma", "release_date": "1999-01-01", "original_language": "he", "original_title": "Mivtza Savta", "genre_ids": [35], "backdrop_path": "/xAeXmhCUGSJXzpQ27AHDeWN6jML.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Mivtza Savta (\"Operation Grandma\") is a satirical Israeli comedy about three very different brothers trying to get around many obstacles to bury their grandmother on her kibbutz.
