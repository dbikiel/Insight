Most of the wildlife shown in the film was donated to what would soon become the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum.  The film was inspired by 10 minutes of footage shot by N. Paul Kenworthy Jr., a doctoral student at the University of California at Los Angeles. Kenworthy\u2019s footage of a battle between a tarantula and a wasp intrigued Disney, who funded a feature-length production following the lives of diverse desert species.
