As with its predecessors, Olga's House of Shame is a silent black and white film with narration to explain the action, but even with direct commentary it's difficult to keep track of the characters and Campbell (who is occasionally caught laughing out loud at the absurdity of it all) has all the menace of a kindergarten teacher, even when wielding a machete.", "poster_path": "/oampyuoWprKn3iimYJeU8GhpkmQ.jpg", "release_date": "1964-02-06", "title": "Olga's House of Shame", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.2, "vote_count": 6, "popularity": 3.015}, {"id": 37601, "video": false, "vote_count": 58, "vote_average": 6.1, "title": "Tombs of the Blind Dead", "release_date": "1972-04-10", "original_language": "es", "original_title": "La noche del terror ciego", "genre_ids": [27], "backdrop_path": "/jMWpOY1bFCezu9YVxw5Nexzp9J9.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "In the thirteenth century, the region around the city of Berzano was ruled by a legion of Templar Knights, who sought eternal life through the ingestion of human blood.
