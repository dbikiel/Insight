A quiet town only 20 blocks long. Esteban returns after years of absence to the place where he spent his childhood summers. He returns looking for his father, Cacho, and to talk \"about Buenos Aires\". But Cacho, a truck driver who has started a new family in La Tigra, is often on the road and their encounter is postponed indefinitely. While he waits, Esteban meets Vero, a childhood friend that has grown into a beautiful woman. Each step together seems to take them back to the most precious moments of a shared memory. But their relationship is not a journey into the past; rather it holds the promise of a future. Federico Godfrid's and Juan Sasia\u00edn's first feature film transmits the warmth, honesty and sadness of this reunion, thanks to its mise en sc\u00e8ne and the performances of Ezequiel Tronconi and Guadalupe Docampo, who give their characters a rare spontaneity.", "poster_path": "/p3M3bqBA9kfMKE3MWIw7mPBM9tU.jpg", "release_date": "2009-09-24", "title": "La Tigra, Chaco", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.3, "vote_count": 3, "popularity": 1.4}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/iwAxyMAVLB3oW33sRcyNLgWm4Fb.jpg", "genre_ids": [10749, 35, 10751], "id": 127061, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Lake Effects", "overview": "Sara and Lily grew up at Smith Mountain Lake.

The next week at the lake is filled with adventure, tears, and laughter as Vivian and her two daughters finally understand, through the guidance of Dad's spirit, if they still belong on the lake, even though Ray is gone. All paths converge at the Smith Mountain Lake Wine Festival, on course for a heart-warming and hilarious collision.
