The film was banned by officials as an anti-socialist, pessimistic and revisionist attack on the state. It henceforth lent its name to all the banned films of 1965, which became known as the \"Rabbit Films.\" After its release in 1990, The Rabbit Is Me earned critical praise as one of the most important and courageous works ever made in East Germany.
