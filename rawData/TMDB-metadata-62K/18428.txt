A return to New York, coupled with a humiliating attempt at getting a new job, serves as the catalyst for him to take action against those who slighted him in the past. Employing strategically placed spy-cams, and operating in tandem with backer, strategist and lover Olivia, he captures compromising footage and broadcasts the edited clips via a newly-minted website. Recognizing the power of their model, the two begin to target CEOs, politicians, those who represent the worst of the establishment. Soon Terell's every move is front-page news, law enforcement is after him, and copy-catters are taking his abduction-and-confession model to extremes he never imagined. With these forces colliding, Terell has to decide whether his actions are sustainable - a decision that will compromise his agenda, his first taste of romance, and his physical wellbeing.", "popularity": 1.052, "poster_path": "/hnXtBGqsJQQvwTzNi5M3Q9HnsnB.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2005-01-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Confess", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "Terell Lessor", "credit_id": "52fe477b9251416c7509b08b", "gender": 2, "id": 342, "name": "Eugene Byrd", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/ab4zEcqdBSjpaz4CPQ2Z6q4rLmO.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "Olivia Averill", "credit_id": "52fe477b9251416c7509b08f", "gender": 1, "id": 17303, "name": "Ali Larter", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/bREO6OEipl4y077K0mdBUXVuE3i.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "Agnes Lessor", "credit_id": "52fe477b9251416c7509b093", "gender": 1, "id": 6832, "name": "Melissa Leo", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/pWP5xzOtoOcqJ0lZo2xguQ5BnrB.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Greg Lanser", "credit_id": "52fe477b9251416c7509b097", "gender": 2, "id": 10694, "name": "Glenn Fitzgerald", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/cPMVT0AclKYbUvB3ZI8bTSVSoTK.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Rober Lampert", "credit_id": "52fe477b9251416c7509b09b", "gender": 2, "id": 6573, "name": "William Sadler", "order": 4, "profile_path": "/nnr5u5lTL9cScrMSKV5MwslgSnn.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 8, "character": "Sally Dewitt", "credit_id": "54033984c3a368119c000504", "gender": 0, "id": 1359080, "name": "Laurie Williams", "order": 5, "profile_path": "/xUhYQIPunm7WLYEGvs4NANnSnFz.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe477b9251416c7509b0a1", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 227945, "job": "Director", "name": "Stefan C.
