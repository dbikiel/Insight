[...] I can\u2019t really say it except to repeat that Bresson note, \u2018that without a thing changing, everything is different.\u2019 The film exists. The fiction is set up, and we believe in it. The justness of the agreement leads us to believe it, because everything plays equally at being a sign. That\u2019s the arrangement of the elements. It\u2019s an act of faith. La vall\u00e9e close is just this: elements treated above all as if in a documentary that, without being changed, portray the story and reveal between them the elements of fiction. But above all seen as they are, insignificant. And then in the relations they set up, they can satisfy our desire for a story. -- Rousseau", "popularity": 0.761, "poster_path": "/3nPCv3EG0VlFmWWJLNaopezoOmu.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "1995-01-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 144, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Enclosed Valley", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.5, "vote_count": 4, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 65720, "video": false, "vote_count": 3, "vote_average": 8.0, "title": "Son Nom de Venise dans Calcutta D\u00e9sert", "release_date": "1976-06-02", "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "Son nom de Venise dans Calcutta d\u00e9sert", "genre_ids": [18], "backdrop_path": null, "adult": false, "overview": "The full soundtrack to Marguerite Duras' 1975 film India Song, about a French ambassador's wife in 1930s India, is here repurposed with all new cinematography.
