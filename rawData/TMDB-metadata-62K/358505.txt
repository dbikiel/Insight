In all those years they loved and hated each other and went through several painful separations. Now, at the end of their lives, the two dancers are willing to open up about their love, their hatred, and their passion. In \"Our Last Tango\" Juan and Mar\u00eda tell their story to a group of young tango dancers and choreographers from Buenos Aires, who transform the most beautiful, moving and dramatic moments of the  lives into incredible tango-choreographies.  These beautifully-shot performances compliment the soul-searching interviews and documentary moments of the film to make this an unforgettable journey into the heart of the tango.", "popularity": 3.136, "poster_path": "/l6CNWKEsFbSV8B0fjYzIG7E78T2.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 32875, "logo_path": null, "name": "Lailaps Pictures", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}, {"iso_3166_1": "AR", "name": "Argentina"}], "release_date": "2015-09-12", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 85, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "es", "name": "Espa\u00f1ol"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "Divided by life, united by Tango.", "title": "Our Last Tango", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.9, "vote_count": 15, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 5178, "video": false, "vote_count": 32, "vote_average": 6.3, "title": "The Good Heart", "release_date": "2009-09-11", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Good Heart", "genre_ids": [35, 18, 10749], "backdrop_path": "/5hKGyD66jVoYBlxtsyBglDPDGlu.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Brian Cox stars as Jacques, the curmudgeonly owner of a gritty New York dive bar that serves as home to a motley assortment of professional drinkers.

Determined to keep his legacy alive, Jacques deems Lucas is a fitting heir and takes him under his wing, schooling him in the male-centric laws of his alcoholic clubhouse: no new customers, no fraternizing with customers and, absolutely no women. Lucas is a quick study, but their friendship is put to the test when the distraught and beautiful April (Isild Le Besco) shows up at the bar seeking shelter, and Lucas insists they help her out.", "poster_path": "/qGs06cDcZdZ0VELasGAVFc5MOSa.jpg", "popularity": 4.048}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 1}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 6, "character": "Herself", "credit_id": "55ecb2adc3a3682c6b010525", "gender": 0, "id": 1506095, "name": "Mar\u00eda Nieves Rego", "order": 0, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "55ecb2acc3a3685375003e93", "gender": 0, "id": 1395096, "name": "Juan Carlos Copes", "order": 1, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 7, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "55ecb2ae9251413e41010b60", "gender": 0, "id": 147016, "name": "Pablo Ver\u00f3n", "order": 2, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "Herself", "credit_id": "55ecb2ac9251413e3e011880", "gender": 0, "id": 1506092, "name": "Alejandra Gutty", "order": 3, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 8, "character": "Herself", "credit_id": "55ecb2aec3a3682c6400f920", "gender": 0, "id": 1506096, "name": "Ayel\u00e9n \u00c1lvarez Mi\u00f1o", "order": 4, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "55ecb2adc3a368090c001784", "gender": 0, "id": 1506093, "name": "Juan Malizia", "order": 5, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "55ecb2ad9251413e45010d2b", "gender": 0, "id": 1506094, "name": "Pancho Mart\u00ednez Pey", "order": 6, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 1, "character": "Herself", "credit_id": "55ecb2ac9251413e45010d26", "gender": 0, "id": 1506091, "name": "Johana Copes", "order": 7, "profile_path": null}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "55ec8a199251413e41010385", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1027729, "job": "Director", "name": "German Kral", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "560ede79c3a368681900c972", "department": "Production", "gender": 2, "id": 2303, "job": "Executive Producer", "name": "Wim Wenders", "profile_path": "/AbqrYglSgaMfetQAeqdHaqiPSof.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "560edeaec3a368681900c977", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 1027729, "job": "Producer", "name": "German Kral", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "560edee69251414779003e5c", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 23174, "job": "Producer", "name": "Nils D\u00fcnker", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "560edefe9251415e53000f0d", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 1517694, "job": "Producer", "name": "Dieter Horres", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "560edf5cc3a368681400dc9e", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 1517695, "job": "Executive Producer", "name": "Rodrigo F\u00fcrth", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "560edf809251411f210018f6", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 1517696, "job": "Executive Producer", "name": "Jakob Abrahamsson", "profile_path": null}]}}
