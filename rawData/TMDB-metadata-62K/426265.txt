The film adopts an innovative structure by interspersing documentary footage and interviews with dramatizations of these different versions of Turner\u2019s story. A unique collaboration between MacArthur Genius Award feature director Charles Burnett, acclaimed historian of slavery Kenneth S. Greenberg and Academy Award-nominated documentary producer Frank Christopher, Nat Turner is a compelling look at one of history\u2019s most mysterious figures.", "poster_path": "/ojT5PRnrVMTzPWYW3cSMtmw15s8.jpg", "popularity": 2.405}, {"id": 428687, "video": false, "vote_count": 70, "vote_average": 5.8, "title": "Deidra & Laney Rob a Train", "release_date": "2017-01-23", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Deidra & Laney Rob a Train", "genre_ids": [35, 80, 18], "backdrop_path": "/mdag3rYRxjDOn19oSmua7XxSCF5.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "After their mother ends up in jail, two sisters turn to train robbery in order to support their family.", "poster_path": "/lLKKDTgUu8bXBKRmkJX25STWeO0.jpg", "popularity": 7.164}, {"id": 433878, "video": false, "vote_count": 21, "vote_average": 7.2, "title": "The Mars Generation", "release_date": "2017-01-20", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Mars Generation", "genre_ids": [99], "backdrop_path": "/2L6oKOhaf1Q5mk6UkJjtuROMbXj.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Aspiring teenage astronauts reveal that a journey to Mars is closer than you think.", "poster_path": "/czL0pSnPEEJJsjrJzg8q86ALvnE.jpg", "popularity": 5.994}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99], "id": 250653, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "E-Team", "overview": "E-Team is driven by the high-stakes investigative work of four intrepid human rights workers, offering a rare look at their lives at home and their dramatic work in the field.", "poster_path": "/k9MUwf7JEqYYi4fkWbCCTdCh3UW.jpg", "release_date": "2014-01-18", "title": "E-Team", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.4, "vote_count": 16, "popularity": 3.836}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/AegTquSFCP4FVYeyQqG0NH6jtLq.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 295886, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Brotherly Love", "overview": "West Philadelphia basketball star Sergio Taylor deals with the pressures of fame while his brother and sister have their own issues with ambition.", "poster_path": "/z8Fg0EcHvNLjvASg0h1FbwvrIXe.jpg", "release_date": "2015-04-24", "title": "Brotherly Love", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.8, "vote_count": 55, "popularity": 5.288}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/98v6K7mvQ9fJMiqvwRpLUP0dlAa.jpg", "genre_ids": [10749, 18], "id": 342925, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Everything Before Us", "overview": "The Department of Emotional Integrity (DEI) documents all relationship activity.
