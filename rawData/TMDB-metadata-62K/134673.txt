Tarkovsky made only seven films in his brief, but brilliant, career; Michal Leszczylowski's respectful movie chronicles him at work on his last film, The Sacrifice. Offering insight into Tarkovsky's working methods and transcendental aesthetics, the movie is a compelling account of the difficulties of film production. In the case of an uncompromising and visionary filmmaker like Tarkovsky, the practical problems of filmmaking are only magnified, as cast and crew struggle to realize the ambitious concepts in Tarkovsky's mind.", "poster_path": "/8z7dXTb9rgz9u7fiqjGp6YK4fzA.jpg", "release_date": "1988-09-23", "title": "Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.7, "vote_count": 3, "popularity": 1.883}, {"id": 52555, "video": false, "vote_count": 4, "vote_average": 5.5, "title": "Chronicle of the Years of Fire", "release_date": "1975-11-26", "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "Chronique des ann\u00e9es de braise", "genre_ids": [18], "backdrop_path": null, "adult": false, "overview": "The beginings of the Algerian Revolution as seen through the eyes of a peasant.", "poster_path": "/kHk8kNbbLyjfXElyig1V3ZXABDu.jpg", "popularity": 1.664}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/hBiPGkU4LklP2151sRr9CAs844b.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 119905, "original_language": "ca", "original_title": "El cant dels ocells", "overview": "The Three Wise Kings travel in search of the Messiah, with unexpected obstacles on the way.", "poster_path": "/es1tmyXVavRDf53qaDtQRCA67E9.jpg", "release_date": "2008-12-19", "title": "Birdsong", "video": false, "vote_average": 8.0, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 2.168}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 206978, "original_language": "ru", "original_title": "\u0421\u043e\u043b\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u043e\u043d", "overview": "This small film came out of the material edited for Sokurov's five-hour documentary Spiritual Voices.", "poster_path": null, "release_date": "1995-06-29", "title": "A Soldier's Dream", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 4, "popularity": 0.642}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 184127, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "M Hotel", "overview": "a film by OG Apichatpong Weerasethakul", "poster_path": "/uuSyI8poqNxj4GNwqq18RZq3YAc.jpg", "release_date": "2011-04-08", "title": "M Hotel", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.8, "vote_count": 4, "popularity": 0.731}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 260387, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "I Know Where I'm Going", "overview": "A fragmented road trip through Britain on the peripheries.

After a girl at the school is found to have been gang-raped, the headmaster chooses Valerka to be one of the scapegoats, though he had nothing to do with the deed.
