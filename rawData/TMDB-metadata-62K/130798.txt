Now he has returned \u2013 and for a reason: To help his mother, Gretel, who has Alzheimer\u2019s, and relieve her long-time carer and his father Malte for a few weeks. The filmmaker takes on the role of carer and documents this encounter with his camera. Gretel no longer knows the people around her, but her puns and charm have not faded. The time spent with his mother becomes a journey into David\u2019s unexpected family history. Once active in Zurich\u2019s left-wing scene, David\u2019s parents enjoyed a lifelong \u201copen relationship\u201d, characterised by a loving distance and mutual respect. VERGISS MEIN NICHT is a film about dementia, but it\u2019s first and foremost a declaration of a love of life and family.", "popularity": 0.912, "poster_path": "/5ICnpUec9mWBoAGiSHfSsDZnXMq.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2013-01-31", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 88, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Forget Me Not", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.6, "vote_count": 10, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 2, "character": "", "credit_id": "52fe4b64c3a368484e187023", "gender": 0, "id": 1092174, "name": "Gretel Sieveking", "order": 0, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "", "credit_id": "52fe4b64c3a368484e187027", "gender": 0, "id": 1092175, "name": "Malte Sieveking", "order": 1, "profile_path": null}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4b64c3a368484e18701f", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 145639, "job": "Director", "name": "David Sieveking", "profile_path": "/rZmM9WU3ip3sS5DTlyCHPQHqMTZ.jpg"}]}}
