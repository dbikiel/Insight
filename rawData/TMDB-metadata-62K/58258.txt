Yi treats Laughing as his own brother, however to protect his territory and illegal businesses, Yi instructed Laughing to join the police force and act as his undercover. Laughing is a high-flyer in the police academy. However he never got a chance to join the force because he is specially picked by Inspector Xian (YUEN BIAO) to be an undercover in the underworld syndicate. Hence Laughing becomes a \u201cdouble-undercover\u201d. Yi is happy that Laughing is allocated to the triad of his rival (FRANCIS NG). To make his situation worse, Laughing falls in love with the triad leader\u2019s sister, Karen. Justice, brotherhood and love, what will Laughing decide on? His decision will be a turning point in his life.", "poster_path": "/bvdeE4iciv8IWNGRg9OK2VOLEzu.jpg", "release_date": "2009-08-13", "title": "Turning Point", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.1, "vote_count": 11, "popularity": 2.507}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [80, 18], "id": 32162, "original_language": "cn", "original_title": "\u9ed1\u767d\u6230\u5834", "overview": "As befits a full-blooded Jiang Hu (underworld) antic, COTL takes place over the course of a short, frenetic period, feeling to all intents and purposes like one night.
