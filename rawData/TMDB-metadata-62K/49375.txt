In the process of doing this, one of the workers is badly injured when the statue falls over and crushes his leg. From the start, many of the townspeople believe the statue to be cursed, but De Perolade is proud of his discovery and sends for Matthew, an authority on antiques. Matthew is also impressed with the statue, which seems to exert a strange fascination over him, but before he can search the area for other artifacts, De Perolade implores him to stay at the house as his guest until the wedding is out of the way. He agrees to this and spends much of his time in the garden trying to capture the statue's eerie beauty in a series of drawings.", "poster_path": "/v9f0ZNWZk756x6fgkG87PwYcH20.jpg", "release_date": "1979-02-01", "title": "The Venus of Ille", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.5, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 1.4}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/wUrqyNUiVoTIRx1zrYiKOTIUI0x.jpg", "genre_ids": [53, 9648], "id": 40210, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Straight on Till Morning", "overview": "Brenda moved to London to begin living those intoxicated fantasies that all young women imagine city life to offer.
