Pablito wants the pedal car he sees in a shop near his home. His family -middle class with bad luck - silently suffers the pressure of the other part of the family- middle class with good luck and best influences. The desire of the car and the hope to get it encourage his parents to take the child, piggy bank in hand, through a strange journey to the colorful and surprisingly familiar world full of lies and blackmail. Pablito emotionally survives in that environment thanks to his ability to get from his imagination the answers that parents and teachers do not give him. And that way, Pablito will create his own happy ending.", "popularity": 1.742, "poster_path": "/xN2qjyd0Vb3QUNKNsq4hMjjQBiq.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2004-01-16", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 92, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "eo", "name": "Esperanto"}, {"iso_639_1": "es", "name": "Espa\u00f1ol"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Pedal Push Car", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 2, "character": "Don Pablo", "credit_id": "52fe4a4cc3a36847f81c622d", "gender": 2, "id": 3813, "name": "\u00c1lex Angulo", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/6wnu91irLrsgy5nF3IxRoH2qKfl.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Pablito", "credit_id": "52fe4a4cc3a36847f81c6235", "gender": 0, "id": 1037826, "name": "Pablo G\u00f3mez", "order": 2, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Estrella", "credit_id": "553e5752c3a3683c4800654c", "gender": 1, "id": 125486, "name": "Rosana Pastor", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/mSFud1jV0Ge8opa4isA0qDfDM8H.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4a4cc3a36847f81c6229", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 24987, "job": "Director", "name": "Ram\u00f3n Barea", "profile_path": "/esfwYqO53LdykT2cvaZURY5ntyh.jpg"}]}}
