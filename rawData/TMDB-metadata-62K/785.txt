Rouqier concentrates on a single French farm family, following them through the four seasons.

The final symbolic images of Spring, achieved through time-lapse photography, are almost unbearably beautiful. The winner of several festival awards, Farrebique nonetheless did not immediately result in an outpouring of financing for Rouqier's follow-up films (this was a common problem in the financially strapped French film industry of the 1940s). Perhaps as a result, Rouqier did not make his sequel, Biquefarre (filmed in the same region, with some of the same \"actors\"), until 1983.", "poster_path": "/rx81Dh44AxQnTtDJqrlFPptvJk5.jpg", "release_date": "1946-09-01", "title": "Farrebique, or the Four Seasons", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 1.139}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/ljZI54Z2P29VrKLnCLBU53G5AFo.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 53], "id": 76848, "original_language": "sv", "original_title": "En kvinnas ansikte", "overview": "A cynical woman with a disfigured face\u2014a hardened criminal\u2014gets an opportunity to change her ways when she meets a sympathetic plastic surgeon.
