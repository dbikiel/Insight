Now, as terror takes hold, the thieves are about to discover that they are being stalked from the shadows and that their odds of living to see daybreak are shrinking with each passing minute.Written by Jason Buchanan, All Movie Guide", "poster_path": "/ys10cnpIda7rWkOv1al6UvQzhhj.jpg", "release_date": "2008-10-28", "title": "13 Hours in a Warehouse", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.7, "vote_count": 13, "popularity": 2.666}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/34psHLeoFFL1Un5cHkHRIdRtpTr.jpg", "genre_ids": [27, 28], "id": 18177, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Automaton Transfusion", "overview": "Three teens find themselves in a town over run with zombies.
