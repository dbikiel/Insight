The film concerns a couple visiting Vermont in order to be married, and interviewing local residents on the subject of marriage. Largely improvised and using non-professional actors, the film was shown at various film festivals including the Melbourne International Film Festival and the Hawaii International Film Festival. The movie was not very well-received by the national press, with the New York Times calling it, \u201cvaguely amiable.\u201d While the Washington Post review commented that the film was an \u201call-too-easy target for ridicule,\u201d it also mentioned one of the film\u2019s high points: \u201cIn one scene, a typically droll Vermont resident (playing himself) sums up his state\u2019s fabled coolness to strangers by suggesting that a sign be placed at the state line, reading \u2018Welcome to Vermont.
