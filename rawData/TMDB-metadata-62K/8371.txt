It is not easy for Achim to get used to an adolescent around the house, especially since Sven hardly speaks to him. But Sven does well in school, and Achim hopes that time will bring them closer together. It is Achim's girlfriend Julia who first senses that something is wrong with Sven. Why, she wonders, does he always hang around with young boys? Why does not he have any friends his own age? She suspects that he is gay. The truth, however, is somewhat more nuanced - and chilling: Sven has pedophile tendencies. Proof is soon found on videos that shock and sicken Achim. Sven himself is shattered and regrets his actions. Julia suggests therapy, but Achim is convinced that he and Sven can handle this together. But he is wrong. Though Sven practically begs his father to lock him up in his room, Achim has confidence in his son.", "popularity": 1.176, "poster_path": "/2q6ws56dWYeput4Ux9kYEunsPeT.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 46, "logo_path": "/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png", "name": "Westdeutscher Rundfunk", "origin_country": "DE"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}], "release_date": "2008-04-09", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "A Good Boy", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 697, "name": "loss of loved one"}, {"id": 970, "name": "parent child relationship"}, {"id": 1749, "name": "taxi driver"}, {"id": 2337, "name": "pedophilia"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 334, "video": false, "vote_count": 1849, "vote_average": 7.7, "title": "Magnolia", "release_date": "1999-12-10", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Magnolia", "genre_ids": [18], "backdrop_path": "/9In3XGQSdr2yfgUoEdCpqxEGAOO.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "An epic mosaic of many interrelated characters in search of happiness, forgiveness, and meaning in the San Fernando Valley.", "poster_path": "/jxkHxPiMfGiFvxSOduNV4oIKJI5.jpg", "popularity": 17.203}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/caLMOD3ZJ3V7qjlxDXrzlJfBLgD.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 10749], "id": 20, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "My Life Without Me", "overview": "A Pedro Almodovar production in which a fatally ill mother with only two months to live creates a list of things she wants to do before she dies with out telling her family of her illness.", "poster_path": "/vVj92VBFUBzjqzLvBiPVVlJDp78.jpg", "release_date": "2003-03-07", "title": "My Life Without Me", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 220, "popularity": 10.382}, {"id": 745, "video": false, "vote_count": 6957, "vote_average": 7.9, "title": "The Sixth Sense", "release_date": "1999-08-06", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Sixth Sense", "genre_ids": [18, 9648, 53], "backdrop_path": "/1X6F9OvfaWl6AGcCdqYl8icxG9z.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A psychological thriller about an eight year old boy named Cole Sear who believes he can see into the world of the dead.
