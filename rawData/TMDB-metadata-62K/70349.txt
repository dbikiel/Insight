However, Kadijevic uses it only as a starting point for his own explorations into the dark side of eroticism. Gogol's story deals with Toma, a reluctant theology student who is forced to read the Psalms over an (un)dead girl for three nights in a row. All the while supernatural forces are trying to grab him from the Holy Circle drawn on the church floor. Kadijevic adapts and enriches 'Viy' by inventing a new backstory for the witch-girl and her father. The dead girl, Catherine (unwittingly killed in the prologue, while in the shape of a hag), is referred to as a 'saint' and her father is a harsh and unpleasant man. Kadijevic departs further from the original story, and introduces an excess of perversity and horror more reminiscent of the Anglo-American gothic than the milder Slavic attempts in a similar mode.", "poster_path": "/y7dXtxdMLlBKvv6YRhi02JU8Jg4.jpg", "release_date": "1990-09-29", "title": "A Holy Place", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 8, "popularity": 1.7}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/3wEzTkAnWGrnoLlmSw8q7L9eFDe.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 35], "id": 67429, "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "Le couple t\u00e9moin", "overview": "In 1977 France, the Ministry of the Future chooses two \u201cnormal,\u201d white, middle-class citizens, Claudine and Jean-Michel, for a national experiment.
