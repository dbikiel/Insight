Arabesque for Kenneth Anger concentrates on visual details found in Moorish architecture and in ancient Spanish tile. The date 1961 refers to the addition of Teiji Ito's soundtrack and its subsequent completion, but the film was likely shot in 1960 or earlier. - David Lewis", "poster_path": "/12vJWnrSd1JVNhHJY28Pk34tAsr.jpg", "release_date": "1961-12-29", "title": "Arabesque for Kenneth Anger", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.9, "vote_count": 12, "popularity": 1.944}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/oLYltHTFgIxT8sgp9gFa9MBNVYY.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 16], "id": 148176, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "A Chairy Tale", "overview": "An ordinary looking chair refuses to be sat upon.", "poster_path": "/uHP7rrb0tAvEX0qwyQBNG2c6NBE.jpg", "release_date": "1957-12-31", "title": "A Chairy Tale", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.9, "vote_count": 16, "popularity": 2.502}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/8JGmDzh7C7mxCBZWcsIDOAuhfiV.jpg", "genre_ids": [16], "id": 128937, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "A Colour Box", "overview": "Animated shapes dance to Cuban music.

Teddy then rides out of the forest followed by two companions afoot, never mind that they all originally arrived afoot. Perhaps it was funnier in its day than it is now, but apparently shooting cats was regarded as funny in those days. The larger point was to use a minor whimsy as a political criticism, in this case of Teddy Roosevelt's easy manipulations of the press.
