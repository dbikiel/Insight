The director, Steven, is determined to make the film as realistic as possible, a goal that doesn't seem too far-fetched when his Finnish sound men discover a hidden room in the hospital basement. There, perfectly preserved, are the original snuff films shot by \"the Auteur\". As Steven's obsession grows, his cast and crew begin to fear for his sanity. But this is only the beginning, because when Steven discovers actual camera used by \"the Auteur\", he assumes the role of the murderous doctor and the real slaughter begins.", "popularity": 3.762, "poster_path": "/iHz6FEeyYoise2WzhCfdjtUVbs4.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 15947, "logo_path": null, "name": "tuotantoyhti\u00f6 legenda", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 23783, "logo_path": null, "name": "Mirada", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 17012, "logo_path": null, "name": "Timeless Films", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FI", "name": "Finland"}], "release_date": "2009-01-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "There's no sequel for you!", "title": "Skeleton Crew", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.5, "vote_count": 19, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 240565, "name": "chainsaw snuff massacre"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [16], "id": 38588, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Alice in the Jungle", "overview": "Alice and Julius the cat are riding an elephant through the jungle.
