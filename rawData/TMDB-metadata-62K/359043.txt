The prevailing view of the mild-mannered Holyfield was that he was a journeyman \u2013 the heavyweight champion, but never a truly great one. Though Holyfield dramatically lost and recaptured the heavyweight crown, and then lost it again, even he understood that his career would ultimately be defined by how he stood up to Tyson \u2013 if he ever got his chance.  By the time of their much-hyped and oft-delayed heavyweight title bout in November of 1996, Holyfield was 34 and considered past his prime.  Four years younger, Tyson was heavily favored to be standing over another meek and easily vanquished opponent at the end.  Instead, we got two of the sport\u2019s most memorable fights \u2013 but for very different reasons.", "popularity": 3.906, "poster_path": "/hYxPMF7C5o0kw1iNHa6zwf5rUU9.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 18595, "logo_path": "/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png", "name": "ESPN Films", "origin_country": "US"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2015-11-10", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 76, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Chasing Tyson", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 11, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 209476, "name": "boxing"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 32063, "video": false, "vote_count": 17, "vote_average": 7.2, "title": "Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson", "release_date": "2004-09-04", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson", "genre_ids": [99], "backdrop_path": "/mHKxW70VEYiiawru0gg5non4MiE.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "The story of Jack Johnson, the first African American Heavyweight boxing champion.", "poster_path": "/9A3hG4XsV49t1Cc3QAnBk6bTW5a.jpg", "popularity": 2.87}, {"id": 1375, "video": false, "vote_count": 1670, "vote_average": 5.6, "title": "Rocky V", "release_date": "1990-10-18", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Rocky V", "genre_ids": [18], "backdrop_path": "/dr5pdEDOdCvelCQqP32UZubiSgE.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A lifetime of taking shots has ended Rocky\u2019s career, and a crooked accountant has left him broke.
