Wishing to repay his father's debt and to secure the forgiveness, Fikret wanders into the real world of Sarajevo, the world that is ruled by post-war chaos, misery and poverty and becomes an ideal target for two corrupted policemen who wish to \"help\" him: they plant the kidnapped girl on him.", "poster_path": "/x4sO6qgscw1FQagGRrokUzjIAWB.jpg", "release_date": "2003-04-16", "title": "Summer in the Golden Valley", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.7, "vote_count": 6, "popularity": 1.678}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/83EDyLcZ9yooFyZTjy0AVoQsREF.jpg", "genre_ids": [99, 18, 36, 10752], "id": 62698, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Lusitania: Murder on the Atlantic", "overview": "The story of the sinking of the Lusitania in 1915 after she was torpedoed off the Irish coast.
