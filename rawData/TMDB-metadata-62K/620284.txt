Attending other conventions across the country and speaking with legendary creators such as Kevin Eastman, Stan Lee and George R.R. Martin, the trio not only begins to find answers to why people gravitate towards superheroes and stories about superheroes, but how being a geek could help them live deeper, richer lives. Geek, and You Shall Find tells the stories behind the creation of several popular stories including Superman, Star Wars, Game of Thrones and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. In sharing how these characters and their worlds came to be, creators reveal how often they have been inspired by real-life social ills. Most importantly, by continuing to speak with fans who have been inspired by these creations, this film reveals how superheroes have the potential to combat these social issues as well.", "popularity": 2.388, "poster_path": "/pB0eOZRnUlyfcvmaKXhbdStV4CO.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2019-07-23", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 91, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Geek, and You Shall Find", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.5, "vote_count": 2, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 11345, "name": "comic-con"}, {"id": 172141, "name": "cosplay"}, {"id": 234708, "name": "comics"}, {"id": 247784, "name": "superheroes"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 91356, "video": false, "vote_count": 29, "vote_average": 6.7, "title": "Comic-Con Episode IV: A Fan's Hope", "release_date": "2011-09-10", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Comic-Con Episode IV: A Fan's Hope", "genre_ids": [99], "backdrop_path": "/9jEhi26UTbZXn2QFzcYtiPyYkWB.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A behind-the-scenes look at San Diego Comic-Con, the world's largest comic book convention, and the fans who attend every year.", "poster_path": "/axltQJKHxolLfbGwuTKZZlLbBsZ.jpg", "popularity": 6.937}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/q59RIuLMNerJbCu87dWtZOEgZke.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 160220, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Bronies: The Extremely Unexpected Adult Fans of My Little Pony", "overview": "A film profiling the unusual cross-demographic fandom of the ostensibly girl oriented television series \"My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic\"", "poster_path": "/oEW5BXfVY6xYNfk1ClhaX4F0SgQ.jpg", "release_date": "2012-11-04", "title": "Bronies: The Extremely Unexpected Adult Fans of My Little Pony", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.2, "vote_count": 31, "popularity": 4.951}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/5JqfbGd425PRS6BQ5MMfzT3g1Wy.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 15800, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Trekkies", "overview": "A hilarious look at the universe's most fervent fans.", "poster_path": "/bXfxkQnoq9xDegq7dmJpJXSMRYf.jpg", "release_date": "1997-10-18", "title": "Trekkies", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 32, "popularity": 6.37}, {"id": 13532, "video": false, "vote_count": 501, "vote_average": 6.1, "title": "Fanboys", "release_date": "2009-02-06", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Fanboys", "genre_ids": [12, 35], "backdrop_path": "/89udmMtxl8AuQHYoFdSgB5e6xYs.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "In 1999, Star Wars fanatics take a cross-country trip to George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch so their dying friend can see a screening of The Phantom Menace before its release.", "poster_path": "/ywI92p2x7D96nuEayGVOMll35SF.jpg", "popularity": 12.769}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/jpK7Z19RDB1oZyQP52p3Yi5LLjr.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 276122, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "A Brony Tale", "overview": "Vancouver-based voice artist Ashleigh Ball has been the voice of numerous characters in classic cartoons such as Care Bears, Strawberry Shortcake, Cinderella and more.
