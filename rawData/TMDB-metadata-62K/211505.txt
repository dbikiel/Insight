In a nation that appears uncertain how to feel about its own history with exploitation film and generally reluctant to embrace genre film - though there are obvious exceptions - Karacadag has jumped headlong into the horror pool.

Both film showcased Karacadag's growing ability to shock and terrify his audiences by taking the rich folklore of his country and pushing it to its dark extremes. And he's at it again with D@BB: Bir Cin Vakasi. The sequel to his original hit, this latest efforts puts away the Japanese influence in favor of a more Paranormal vibe, but the underlying mythology remains purely regional with the story following a Turkish family whose home is possessed by angry jinns", "popularity": 4.513, "poster_path": "/4RCxJFhVljr1AwnHuBPTbfrWfxM.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 90177, "logo_path": null, "name": "J-Plan", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "TR", "name": "Turkey"}], "release_date": "2012-08-02", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 119, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "tr", "name": "T\u00fcrk\u00e7e"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Dabbe: Bir Cin Vakas\u0131", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.3, "vote_count": 19, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [27, 9648], "id": 133666, "original_language": "tr", "original_title": "D@bbe 2", "overview": "Internet network has spread into every home Dabbe, under the command of electromagnetic systems all over the world with demons and shadow assets were seized.", "poster_path": "/npxVq6MZkNngWtv6YE2K9SiIilE.jpg", "release_date": "2009-12-24", "title": "D@bbe 2", "video": false, "vote_average": 2.1, "vote_count": 7, "popularity": 1.39}, {"id": 254712, "video": false, "vote_count": 23, "vote_average": 5.9, "title": "Dabbe: Cin \u00c7arpmas\u0131", "release_date": "2013-09-12", "original_language": "tr", "original_title": "Dabbe: Cin \u00c7arpmas\u0131", "genre_ids": [27], "backdrop_path": "/bx5JBlrLPGK1679U4o5pVUwdZVk.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Preparing for her wedding, K\u00fcbra gets possessed by unknown livings.
