At the climax of their dispute they rip the family recipe book in half - one brother gets the starters and the other gets the main courses. They set up rival restaurants, across the road from each other, and spend the next twenty years trying to out-do each other. Neither brother will admit it but they both know they are not entirely successful in the 'other half' of the menu. It takes a daughter - a successful corporate lawyer marrying a man from a very different background - to reunite them. She is planning her marriage and is determined that they will both cook the wedding banquet.", "popularity": 1.619, "poster_path": "/xueKk3Zhw7KX9ctzyBQ0bNpiRi9.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2013-09-06", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 84, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "hi", "name": "\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Jadoo", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 4, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 13027, "name": "wedding"}, {"id": 155951, "name": "indian food"}, {"id": 156195, "name": "family feud"}, {"id": 222083, "name": "cooking competition"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/wyvHy4ElaiNamrpS6fjquYQqxhQ.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 18, 10749], "id": 712, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Four Weddings and a Funeral", "overview": "Over the course of five social occasions, a committed bachelor must consider the notion that he may have discovered love.", "poster_path": "/md9kMKnLG8LG4pMDM98gy5x4K5L.jpg", "release_date": "1994-03-09", "title": "Four Weddings and a Funeral", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.7, "vote_count": 1456, "popularity": 16.731}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/gRY30dvyLhydkblpE0v3NiXt0Nj.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 10749], "id": 6557, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "27 Dresses", "overview": "Altruistic Jane finds herself facing her worst nightmare as her younger sister announces her engagement to the man Jane secretly adores.", "poster_path": "/zzJtHNzi1D4CPwRlPHV1TRQNXD2.jpg", "release_date": "2008-01-10", "title": "27 Dresses", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.3, "vote_count": 2137, "popularity": 14.081}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/f7pTesNnPjOVAq7QqhgnSHaK9Cc.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 10749], "id": 10521, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Bride Wars", "overview": "Two best friends become rivals when their respective weddings are accidentally booked for the same day.", "poster_path": "/y5O46J9i98MkcExaPIeZaRImF4C.jpg", "release_date": "2009-01-09", "title": "Bride Wars", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 1901, "popularity": 15.977}, {"id": 2959, "video": false, "vote_count": 567, "vote_average": 5.6, "title": "License to Wed", "release_date": "2007-07-04", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "License to Wed", "genre_ids": [35], "backdrop_path": "/tdWTbuP08jRS08XuNkBBCgKNR1B.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Newly engaged, Ben and Sadie can't wait to start their life together and live happily ever after.
