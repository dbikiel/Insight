The videos featured crude MS Paint animation and a loud, highpitched, childlike voice narrating. On September 7, the fifth, final episode was released, but featured an unexpected twist - about 20 seconds into it, the crude sketchy animation switched to intricately crafted 3D with an orchestral soundtrack; the whole Octocat story (and as such, the Randy Peters persona) was revealed to be by David O'Reilly.[8] In an interview he said \"I wanted to try experimenting with the Youtube audience and Microsoft Paint. The story for Octocat came to me by reading the bible word-for-word backwards\"", "popularity": 0.6, "poster_path": "/ohosao5mxg9KIEj47urYfR9KMWH.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2008-03-13", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 4, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Octocat Adventures", "video": false, "vote_average": 2.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4d019251416c9110755d", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 107850, "job": "Director", "name": "David O'Reilly", "profile_path": "/ek0PyN648QhQEot5F6iptblujIx.jpg"}]}}
