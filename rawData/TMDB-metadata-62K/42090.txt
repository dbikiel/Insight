Von Krusenstjarna teamed up with the eccentric bisexual David Sprengel (Erland Josephson) and continued to suffer bouts of mental instability that Sprengel felt were best cured by sexual abandon. Von Krusenstjarna was not a model of emotional health when she first met Sprengel. She had inherited madness from her family while at the same time passionately rebelled against the narrow-minded mores of her genteel but poor parents. With his own wildly unorthodox behavior, Sprengel both helped and hindered Von Krusenstjarna throughout their turbulent relationship.", "poster_path": "/ySPZ5poY4B0oMjIS6dSS9Z65eIa.jpg", "popularity": 1.369}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/qumhydiYZgdX6Cww7bOMwZTKYNC.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 148355, "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "La villa Santo Sospir", "overview": "A 35-minute color film by Cocteau entitled \"La Villa Santo Sospir.\" Shot in 1952, this is an \"amateur film\" done in 16mm, a sort of home movie in which Cocteau takes the viewer on a tour of a friend's villa on the French coast (a major location used in Testament of Orpheus).
