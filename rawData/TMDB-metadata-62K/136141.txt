Richard Kaplan's lively documentary reveals the human face behind the American icon, beginning with the emotional deprivation suffered by this plain, awkward little girl born into a socially prominent and powerful family. Though she would eventually marry a man who would look beyond her awkwardness, Eleanor was not content to be the proper, silent wife to her husband Franklin's extraordinary political career. Instead, she began a lifelong crusade to speak out about injustice and oppression in any form.", "poster_path": "/fmKMKRqCVDYP6sIUw1HLRCCP8Kd.jpg", "release_date": "1965-11-08", "title": "The Eleanor Roosevelt Story", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 2.53}, {"id": 65991, "video": false, "vote_count": 7, "vote_average": 6.0, "title": "Hunt the Man Down", "release_date": "1950-12-26", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Hunt the Man Down", "genre_ids": [80, 9648], "backdrop_path": "/vdFm47Y0En8NgYXHbI0NCg63Ua9.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A lawyer uncovers secrets behind a 12-year-old murder case.", "poster_path": "/jdFhPDswhOovFyxYBNEaaZwHqCh.jpg", "popularity": 3.63}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/ekSI8N8VxGMHBu8nvqc4dAvmFkG.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 185078, "original_language": "it", "original_title": "Senza piet\u00e0", "overview": "An Italian sex worker falls in love with a black American soldier during World War II.", "poster_path": "/fETvnZMnVAGRqUYINZuWvrItZl.jpg", "release_date": "1948-08-04", "title": "Without Pity", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 2.231}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/PeeRgvoraG0RcNg5ZZ5tL5snP6.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 53], "id": 60743, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "They Made Me a Killer", "overview": "A fugitive receives help from a victim's sister as he tries to clear his name of robbery and murder charges.", "poster_path": "/hUXdg6hfZsGijy5YtafJxMUiZt2.jpg", "release_date": "1946-05-03", "title": "They Made Me a Killer", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 3.71}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/jrSkpcXZZsc0TOmc7UMXyPrlJrd.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 80], "id": 60606, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Sun Sets at Dawn", "overview": "A reporter investigates the story of a young man who may have been wrongly convicted and sentenced to be executed.", "poster_path": "/hnYkEuJ927Q7vsZs7VUjjaUDCJJ.jpg", "release_date": "1950-11-01", "title": "The Sun Sets at Dawn", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.8, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 2.93}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 339876, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "I, Dalio", "overview": "The great French actor, Marcel Dalio, who has the lead role in Jean Renoir's THE RULES OF THE GAME, also appears in Renoir's GRAND ILLUSION. In both films he plays a character who is Jewish, as Dalio was in real life. In fact, in most of the French films he's in the 1930s, he almost always plays shady characters, informers, blackmailers and gangsters. In other words, he is always \"the Jew.\" When the Nazis invaded France in 1940, he fled to America and appeared in CASABLANCA and TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT. In America, he was no longer the Jew but The Frenchman. He became, in dozens of films, America's idea of a typical Frenchman. His film career has these two strands in which he has two different identities. Are you defined by other people and their perceptions of who you are? Are you always a creation of the way people want to see you? Or can you exist outside of the arbitrary boundaries which are placed on you?", "poster_path": "/bnk04Njr8wu3YPdJLA6jDP9Ecxe.jpg", "release_date": "2015-04-30", "title": "I, Dalio", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 2.437}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [16], "id": 284957, "original_language": "cs", "original_title": "Lev a p\u00edsni\u010dka", "overview": "Story of a wandering musical beggar's encounter with a hungry lion.", "poster_path": null, "release_date": "1959-01-02", "title": "The Lion and the Song", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 1.315}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [35], "id": 189634, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Saturday Afternoon", "overview": "Harry and his friend have planned to go out for an afternoon of fun.
