Lesy discovered a striking archive of black and white photographs in the town of Black River Falls dating from the 1890s and married a selection of these images to extracts from the town's newspaper from the same decade. The effect was surprising and disturbing. The town of Black River Falls seems gripped by some peculiar malaise and the weekly news is dominated by bizarre tales of madness, eccentricity and violence amongst the local population.", "popularity": 3.804, "poster_path": "/atngFVxShIsk2KDQdHnehtRtSZA.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1999-09-05", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 76, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Wisconsin Death Trip", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.8, "vote_count": 11, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 818, "name": "based on novel or book"}, {"id": 2024, "name": "wisconsin"}, {"id": 207928, "name": "19th century"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/kiWvoV78Cc3fUwkOHKzyBgVdrDD.jpg", "genre_ids": [37, 18, 12], "id": 281957, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Revenant", "overview": "In the 1820s, a frontiersman, Hugh Glass, sets out on a path of vengeance against those who left him for dead after a bear mauling.", "poster_path": "/oXUWEc5i3wYyFnL1Ycu8ppxxPvs.jpg", "release_date": "2015-12-25", "title": "The Revenant", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.5, "vote_count": 12122, "popularity": 30.491}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/dLAPTvBwEdP4h7a14isNc0HwmOj.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 10749], "id": 250734, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Far from the Madding Crowd", "overview": "Based on the literary classic by Thomas Hardy.
