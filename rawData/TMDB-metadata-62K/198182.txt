She finds, however, that these ghosts don't want her help -- they want to lead Lucy and her family to their doom.", "popularity": 3.108, "poster_path": "/60Y6rc8anvm7bJCThKVKP1mQdsg.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2014-01-13", "revenue": 0, "runtime": null, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Occupants", "video": false, "vote_average": 3.6, "vote_count": 8, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/nS548OEoTBBmLVQhp0OLM0LIUPn.jpg", "genre_ids": [35], "id": 111352, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "T.J.
