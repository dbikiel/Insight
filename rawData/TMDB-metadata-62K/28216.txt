With Bruce doing all the voices, this animation begins with local folks upset at the Lone Ranger because he won't stay around to be thanked after a good deed. So, he stays and finds he likes hearing \"Thank you mask man.\" When their attention starts to shift elsewhere, he shocks and disgusts the townspeople with a final request.  According to the cartoon\u2019s producer John Magnuson, at early showings of this, gay audiences were upset by its apparent \u201cfag-bashing\u201d.

But it\u2019s within the larger context of Bruce\u2019s analysis of heroism, and that the towns people reject the Masked Man is because of their prejudices, not because Bruce is asking us to endorse them.
