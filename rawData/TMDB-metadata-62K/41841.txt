When Daniel Hackett sees his father Jonas gravely wounded by the villainous Stiles, his first urge is for his family to flee the danger, and give up their life on a farm which Daniel has come to despise anyway. Going alone to a lake to try to decide what to do, he falls asleep on a boat and wakes to find himself in the wild west, in the company of such \"tall tale\" legends as Pecos Bill, Paul Bunyan, John Henry and Calamity Jane. Together, they battle the same villains Daniel is facing in his \"real\" world, ending with a heroic confrontation in which the boy stands up to Stiles and his henchmen, and rallies his neighbors to fight back against land grabbers who want to destroy their town.", "popularity": 7.572, "poster_path": "/g20GsTJ3gDVEt17Z13vXzjJ7RON.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 175, "logo_path": "/trtXLj3zv8T9ke1Vhw4SCkkM4JJ.png", "name": "Caravan Pictures", "origin_country": "US"}, {"id": 2, "logo_path": "/wdrCwmRnLFJhEoH8GSfymY85KHT.png", "name": "Walt Disney Pictures", "origin_country": "US"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1995-03-24", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 98, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "Sometime the hero ends up being you!", "title": "Tall Tale", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 33, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/yQQ47czcfyLjJOK8145OKWZpZyC.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 10751, 10770], "id": 6558, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Mail To The Chief", "overview": "A humorous and inspiring adventure about an ordinary middle school student who strikes up an online friendship with someone bearing the screen name Average Joe, only to discover that he's been corresponding with and giving political advice to the President of the United States.", "poster_path": "/970JAeX2zbM1JkUuwICfmgNFPoL.jpg", "release_date": "2000-04-02", "title": "Mail To The Chief", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.8, "vote_count": 4, "popularity": 3.777}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/2OD2CiFEQ9rMBGi1L838D6WPCGv.jpg", "genre_ids": [10751, 35], "id": 126935, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "H.E.
