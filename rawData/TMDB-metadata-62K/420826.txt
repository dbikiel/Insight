When plague empties a town of its inhabitants, he takes the opportunity to burgle a house. He finds nothing except Shanti, a widowed daughter-in-law who has been left to die by her cruel relatives. Shaka nurses her back to health. When her relatives return they are not pleased to find her alive and even less pleased to discover that someone has tried to rob them. Shanti gets the blame and a beating. Shaka saves her from worse, at the hands of brother-in-law, and the pair flee. They set up home in Shaka's house, much to the displeasure of the respectable neighbours who are all too ready to think the worst.", "popularity": 0.6, "poster_path": "/nrAm9bXUO6lOShdSl0bXEu6aiaB.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 66530, "logo_path": null, "name": "Ralhan Productions Pvt.
