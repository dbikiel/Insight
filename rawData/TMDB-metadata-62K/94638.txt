In both films he plays a character who is Jewish, as Dalio was in real life. In fact, in most of the French films he's in the 1930s, he almost always plays shady characters, informers, blackmailers and gangsters. In other words, he is always \"the Jew.\" When the Nazis invaded France in 1940, he fled to America and appeared in CASABLANCA and TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT. In America, he was no longer the Jew but The Frenchman. He became, in dozens of films, America's idea of a typical Frenchman. His film career has these two strands in which he has two different identities. Are you defined by other people and their perceptions of who you are? Are you always a creation of the way people want to see you? Or can you exist outside of the arbitrary boundaries which are placed on you?", "poster_path": "/bnk04Njr8wu3YPdJLA6jDP9Ecxe.jpg", "release_date": "2015-04-30", "title": "I, Dalio", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 1.741}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [16], "id": 284957, "original_language": "cs", "original_title": "Lev a p\u00edsni\u010dka", "overview": "Story of a wandering musical beggar's encounter with a hungry lion.", "poster_path": null, "release_date": "1959-01-02", "title": "The Lion and the Song", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 1.091}, {"id": 65991, "video": false, "vote_count": 7, "vote_average": 6.0, "title": "Hunt the Man Down", "release_date": "1950-12-26", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Hunt the Man Down", "genre_ids": [80, 9648], "backdrop_path": "/vdFm47Y0En8NgYXHbI0NCg63Ua9.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A lawyer uncovers secrets behind a 12-year-old murder case.", "poster_path": "/jdFhPDswhOovFyxYBNEaaZwHqCh.jpg", "popularity": 2.792}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/PeeRgvoraG0RcNg5ZZ5tL5snP6.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 53], "id": 60743, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "They Made Me a Killer", "overview": "A fugitive receives help from a victim's sister as he tries to clear his name of robbery and murder charges.", "poster_path": "/hUXdg6hfZsGijy5YtafJxMUiZt2.jpg", "release_date": "1946-05-03", "title": "They Made Me a Killer", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 3.726}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/ug5BdBYFUyjCvSIKP54lXOnJsFw.jpg", "genre_ids": [10402, 18], "id": 72856, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Hallelujah", "overview": "A black laborer turns preacher after accidentally killing a man.", "poster_path": "/eVFaCwo95VcAS8wzwuR1wIQ6LBr.jpg", "release_date": "1929-08-20", "title": "Hallelujah", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 14, "popularity": 4.485}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/pyx3jDxiIDPmdYQzxfcrE02kB5X.jpg", "genre_ids": [28, 18], "id": 42836, "original_language": "de", "original_title": "Kameradschaft", "overview": "The picture tells of a mine disaster where German miners rescue French miners from an undergound fire and explosion.
