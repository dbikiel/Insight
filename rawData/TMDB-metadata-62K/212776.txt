The suspicions fall on El Lince, an old-fashioned antiquarian who had bid with the English to get the book. When he is arrested, he asks his nephew to warn Curro Jim\u00e9nez, who discovers that the famous treaty actually contains the key to accessing a fantastic treasure that a caliph has hidden in the Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba and that has been, for centuries, cause of deaths and betrayals. But the stolen book is split in half. The other half is, for years, in the power of El Lince, which he bought from the famous bandit Mariano Romero, who has been presumed dead for thirty years.", "popularity": 0.674, "poster_path": "/cDaz1kxbJ1arTHH47hlfk3OOGt4.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "ES", "name": "Spain"}], "release_date": "1978-09-04", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 91, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "es", "name": "Espa\u00f1ol"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Avisa a Curro Jim\u00e9nez", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "", "credit_id": "52fe4db6c3a368484e1f8957", "gender": 2, "id": 7352, "name": "Sancho Gracia", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/gxX2SlP8JkTUW5Nc4n0wyn2AxZU.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "", "credit_id": "52fe4db6c3a368484e1f895b", "gender": 1, "id": 100926, "name": "\u00c1gata Lys", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/onrcBUu1r8LO1DEkRtbcWTWqupm.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "", "credit_id": "52fe4db6c3a368484e1f895f", "gender": 2, "id": 3811, "name": "Jos\u00e9 Sancho", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/6M18MaEHaOyT4QcAKz9RRIGJm8T.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "", "credit_id": "52fe4db6c3a368484e1f8963", "gender": 2, "id": 228494, "name": "\u00c1lvaro de Luna", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/38YvVsGjJZq8DDh7rGqCr8FTr5l.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 6, "character": "", "credit_id": "53a14ef3c3a3687ba6001f00", "gender": 2, "id": 100307, "name": "Alfredo Mayo", "order": 4, "profile_path": "/kUhzJI6FRlIgSjd76O62eMj7iQl.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4db6c3a368484e1f8969", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 104278, "job": "Director", "name": "Rafael Romero Marchent", "profile_path": null}]}}
