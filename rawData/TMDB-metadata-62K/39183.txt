With the arrival of Pele, the Cosmos became a hit  and the players became the toast of the town, earning their own private table at Studio 54. A number of other international soccer stars were soon lured to the Cosmos, including Franz Beckenbauer, Rodney Marsh, and Carlos Alberto, but with the turn of the decade, the team began losing favor with fans and folded in 1985.", "popularity": 2.363, "poster_path": "/mYpgwxTLhCTHoA0LXyRAYhTcpUi.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2006-01-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 97, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "The untold story of the team that had America at its feet.", "title": "Once in a Lifetime: The Extraordinary Story of the New York Cosmos", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.8, "vote_count": 8, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 242, "name": "new york"}, {"id": 164002, "name": "beckenbauer"}, {"id": 164003, "name": "pele"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 1051, "video": false, "vote_count": 854, "vote_average": 7.6, "title": "The French Connection", "release_date": "1971-10-09", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The French Connection", "genre_ids": [28, 80, 53], "backdrop_path": "/hPlzjKzbO8KuCerm1lOxDtUjlHD.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Tough narcotics detective 'Popeye' Doyle is in hot pursuit of a suave French drug dealer who may be the key to a huge heroin-smuggling operation.", "poster_path": "/5XSGvIKl2yPvOkieFjc3rzLw7x0.jpg", "popularity": 14.703}, {"id": 772, "video": false, "vote_count": 5551, "vote_average": 6.5, "title": "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York", "release_date": "1992-11-19", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York", "genre_ids": [12, 35, 80, 10751], "backdrop_path": "/1uHTuwx5h9T3XzsXijMMKybDFvZ.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Instead of flying to Florida with his folks, Kevin ends up alone in New York, where he gets a hotel room with his dad's credit card\u2014despite problems from a clerk and meddling bellboy.
