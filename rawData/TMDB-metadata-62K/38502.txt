Uprooted, far from his loved ones, unable to speak French and faced with a completely alien world, he becomes despondent. When he refuses to eat and expresses a wish to die, his nurse, Carole, comes to the realization that Tivii's illness is not the most serious threat to his well-being. She arranges to have a young orphan, Kaki, transferred to the institution. The boy is also sick, but has experience with both worlds and speaks both languages. By sharing his culture with Kaki and opening it up to others, Tivii rediscovers his pride and energy. Ultimately he also rediscovers hope through a plan to adopt Kaki, bring him home and make him part of his family", "popularity": 1.339, "poster_path": "/hjGRo3dBFb5m2RtaP58NQieEZQ6.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 806, "logo_path": "/kcNh09qqR2Pkw1JAzRW4CommrW4.png", "name": "T\u00e9l\u00e9film Canada", "origin_country": "CA"}, {"id": 2743, "logo_path": null, "name": "Astral Media", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 8582, "logo_path": null, "name": "Canadian Film or Video Production Tax Credit Fund (CPTC)", "origin_country": "CA"}, {"id": 9115, "logo_path": null, "name": "Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 11578, "logo_path": null, "name": "Super \u00c9cran", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 20428, "logo_path": null, "name": "APTN", "origin_country": "CA"}, {"id": 6932, "logo_path": "/uEduUiOCSyhg4ZyGoNJ5XD3kAMt.png", "name": "ACPAV", "origin_country": "CA"}, {"id": 9116, "logo_path": "/vYeYdFxDWoqBzFgYz2Tf9d2ZseE.png", "name": "SODEC", "origin_country": "CA"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CA", "name": "Canada"}], "release_date": "2008-08-25", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 102, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Necessities of Life", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.6, "vote_count": 7, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 3179, "name": "sanatorium"}, {"id": 3355, "name": "inuit"}, {"id": 159845, "name": "tuberculosis"}, {"id": 198500, "name": "sickness"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/mrvlpJFAzKwZZkLm9VD7Rh2VECi.jpg", "genre_ids": [12, 35, 18, 14], "id": 116745, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty", "overview": "A timid magazine photo manager who lives life vicariously through daydreams embarks on a true-life adventure when a negative goes missing.", "poster_path": "/b0nIj7dr2bcLAn3erYhql7f6aUm.jpg", "release_date": "2013-12-18", "title": "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.1, "vote_count": 5240, "popularity": 21.799}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/cMrvn4Hl0A0NAL61BpDWQIsMsiN.jpg", "genre_ids": [16], "id": 149870, "original_language": "ja", "original_title": "\u98a8\u7acb\u3061\u306c", "overview": "A lifelong love of flight inspires Japanese aviation engineer Jiro Horikoshi, whose storied career includes the creation of the A-6M World War II fighter plane.", "poster_path": "/3OTcCyf7QbGdVxsS8GLtaSsTZtP.jpg", "release_date": "2013-07-20", "title": "The Wind Rises", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.8, "vote_count": 1427, "popularity": 23.476}, {"id": 173, "video": false, "vote_count": 368, "vote_average": 7.0, "title": "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea", "release_date": "1954-05-13", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea", "genre_ids": [12, 878], "backdrop_path": "/y2PFn5oP0jWt5Kk0EwFcWenqawp.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A ship sent to investigate a wave of mysterious sinkings encounters the advanced submarine, the Nautilus, commanded by Captain Nemo.", "poster_path": "/yhoL2CxBp9IwMhHrCj6FIb2lrYR.jpg", "popularity": 18.386}, {"id": 635, "video": false, "vote_count": 725, "vote_average": 7.2, "title": "Angel Heart", "release_date": "1987-03-06", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Angel Heart", "genre_ids": [27, 9648], "backdrop_path": "/lMsT7WcLHVucDsOG2aUlm8AbkvZ.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Down-and-out private detective Harry Angel is ordered by the mysterious Louis Cyphre to go on a mission to find a missing person.
