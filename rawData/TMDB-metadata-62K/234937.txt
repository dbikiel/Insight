In Forever we see the mysterious, calming and consoling beauty of this unique cemetery through the eyes of people of flesh and blood. Many come for their 'own' beloved: husbands, wives, family and friends. Others Honor 'their' artist by leaving behind a personal message or a flower. While admirers share with us the importance of art and beauty in their lives, the graveyard gradually reveals itself as a source of inspiration for the living. Death offers little consolation except for the passing of time, the melancholia of a moss-covered tomb, and the beauty and power of a piece of music, a poem or a painting Written by Cobos", "popularity": 1.063, "poster_path": "/lRdh2UqLGcSUDNR53pi5MjjIHk1.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 12023, "logo_path": "/97tVKGqnkjn0hwTGGRDPRgYWbrE.png", "name": "Nederlandse Programma Stichting (NPS)", "origin_country": "NL"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "NL", "name": "Netherlands"}], "release_date": "2006-10-05", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 97, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Forever", "video": false, "vote_average": 10.0, "vote_count": 2, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 1227, "name": "cemetery"}, {"id": 2679, "name": "artist"}, {"id": 2968, "name": "grave"}, {"id": 4434, "name": "interview"}, {"id": 187056, "name": "woman director"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/gZeJziVigmRqbkEZwKAtSqlLQ6s.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 10749], "id": 370663, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Below Her Mouth", "overview": "An unexpected affair quickly escalates into a heart-stopping reality for two women whose passionate connection changes their lives forever.", "poster_path": "/nTGbq37hYLuNy7YgMg0gVLma0NS.jpg", "release_date": "2016-09-10", "title": "Below Her Mouth", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 456, "popularity": 22.676}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/6tern9vOEwwmkDYC1vRCuO64z0C.jpg", "genre_ids": [10749, 18], "id": 475888, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Tell It to the Bees", "overview": "Dr. Jean Markham returns to the town she left as a teenager to take over her late father's medical practice.
