A pulsing mix of hard-hitting action, wry social commentary, and black humor, director Jang Hang Joon's Break Out takes a simple premise and spins it into a spiraling film experience. Penniless and slothful Bong Gu (Kim Seung Woo) loses his cheap lighter in the Seoul train station washroom, and it falls into the hands of gangster leader Chul Gon (Cha Seung Won). Bong Gu, determined to retrieve his lighter, follows Chul Gon to Pusan, but the task turns out to be a lot more difficult than he had imagined.", "poster_path": "/bEWNsvVY8y33s9ZcXq6BnHWTMVh.jpg", "release_date": "2002-07-17", "title": "Break Out", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.3, "vote_count": 6, "popularity": 1.214}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [28, 35], "id": 52423, "original_language": "ko", "original_title": "\uac78\uc2a4\uce74\uc6b0\ud2b8", "overview": "When the head of a credit union disappears with the credit union's money, four women create a team called Bong Chon Girl Scouts Troop #3 to recover the stolen money, and chaos ensues.", "poster_path": "/5cHrIzPHp2854c7QSe1ETkw1T25.jpg", "release_date": "2008-06-05", "title": "Girl Scout", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.7, "vote_count": 3, "popularity": 0.71}, {"id": 65337, "video": false, "vote_count": 8, "vote_average": 5.8, "title": "Public Enemy Returns", "release_date": "2008-06-19", "original_language": "ko", "original_title": "\uac15\ucca0\uc911: \uacf5\uacf5\uc758 \uc801 1-1", "genre_ids": [28, 35, 80, 18], "backdrop_path": "/zfJ5hWSgVbkaBl7BugNViadJ69m.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "KANG Chul-jung has been a detective fighting crime for 15 years and is at it again against a mob boss who recruits young kids to do his dirty work.", "poster_path": "/wr7CWangsK7jI6KQYxfDpcVsisO.jpg", "popularity": 1.642}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/5igyVNGrXX24oloMQASRW8sFSnx.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 9648, 878, 53], "id": 36167, "original_language": "ja", "original_title": "Dragon Head", "overview": "Teru Aoki (\u9752\u6728 \u8f1d) is on a train to Tokyo after a school trip.
