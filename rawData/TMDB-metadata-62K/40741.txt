It's unlikely in gang-plagued Japan.

After three years, the gangs he embarrassed when he saved his wife find the family and leave Jokichi in grief, vowing revenge. To parry his terrible swift sword, rival gangs join forces, hiring a prostitute to pose as a woman needing help and breaking the code of honor to double cross the drifter. He finds unlikely allies: a thief who aids him for fun and a one-eyed swordsman who may be Jokichi's equal in skill and honor.", "popularity": 1.33, "poster_path": "/Aj2KeqYcAt5oHwm7u3HHJk84AaE.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 44545, "logo_path": null, "name": "Tokyo Eiga Co., Ltd.", "origin_country": "JP"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "JP", "name": "Japan"}], "release_date": "1972-06-10", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 87, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ja", "name": "\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Trail of Blood", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 4, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 1462, "name": "samurai"}, {"id": 9748, "name": "revenge"}, {"id": 202409, "name": "chanbara"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/a24i4Qw6qFTtkFLQsncv8WPwevj.jpg", "genre_ids": [53, 28, 80], "id": 345887, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Equalizer 2", "overview": "Robert McCall, who serves an unflinching justice for the exploited and oppressed, embarks on a relentless, globe-trotting quest for vengeance when a long-time girl friend is murdered.", "poster_path": "/cQvc9N6JiMVKqol3wcYrGshsIdZ.jpg", "release_date": "2018-07-19", "title": "The Equalizer 2", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 2483, "popularity": 21.271}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/2BLk25CMNl22IHqVJSAu3nkWoUj.jpg", "genre_ids": [28, 80, 53], "id": 26789, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "No Mercy", "overview": "An unconventional undercover Chicago cop and his partner are recruited to commit the murder of a New Orleans criminal kingpin.", "poster_path": "/iQozlPXgadwTvymHWH1mPWzM80a.jpg", "release_date": "1986-12-19", "title": "No Mercy", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.8, "vote_count": 71, "popularity": 9.238}, {"id": 458594, "video": false, "vote_count": 983, "vote_average": 6.5, "title": "Peppermint", "release_date": "2018-09-06", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Peppermint", "genre_ids": [28, 53], "backdrop_path": "/9krZX6T4EEs5eFpXgSi8jZkN48O.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A grieving mother transforms herself into a vigilante following the murders of her husband and daughter, eluding the authorities to deliver her own personal brand of justice.", "poster_path": "/jrzxS0vcbzIIay1sdYm0rgI2QfJ.jpg", "popularity": 18.265}, {"id": 156022, "video": false, "vote_count": 5468, "vote_average": 7.2, "title": "The Equalizer", "release_date": "2014-09-24", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Equalizer", "genre_ids": [28, 80, 53], "backdrop_path": "/vbl4ZVqelrrzJ16fdDOq9siWbpi.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "McCall believes he has put his mysterious past behind him and dedicated himself to beginning a new, quiet life.
