Constructed hundreds of years ago during the Inca Empire, this vast transportation network still weaves its way through modern-day Peru and Ecuador. More so than other remnants of the Inca civilization, Qhapaq \u00d1an is a symbol of a common identity that nourishes the dream of the Andean people to this day - to revive their cultural inheritance following centuries of European domination. As this visually striking documentary takes us along the Great Inca Road - revealing its contours, its history, and its secrets - we witness a different image of the Andes and its people.", "popularity": 0.6, "poster_path": "/optDq3JZHeNcT85Axaas6aoDohi.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2009-01-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 78, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "es", "name": "Espa\u00f1ol"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "A Journey on Qhapaq \u00d1an - The Great Inca Road", "title": "Voices of the Andes", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4b89c3a368484e18df79", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1094582, "job": "Director", "name": "St\u00e9phane Pachot", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe4b89c3a368484e18df7f", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 1094583, "job": "Writer", "name": "St\u00e9phane Pachot", "profile_path": null}]}}
