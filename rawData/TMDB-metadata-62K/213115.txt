They're in the middle of their marital troubles, and at the start of the film are in a bind- will they split for falling out of love, or stay for their child? Soon though, as the child gets a little older, the father leaves, and the mother becomes the primary parent of the intelligent, eccentric, and funny (in a 'French' sort of way) pre-teen. The film is highlighted with a terrific bit of music from Gustav Mahler (the scene itself is surreal when you first see it, but thinking about it it makes sense from the point of view of a kid), and a quiet scene with the daughter and her father late in the film.", "popularity": 1.02, "poster_path": "/kZ8KuvSdAeC95klwoaI3IYIFgb2.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 29229, "logo_path": null, "name": "P\u00e9gase Films", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 22811, "logo_path": null, "name": "JLG Films", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CH", "name": "Switzerland"}, {"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "1985-10-11", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 28, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Book of Mary", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.3, "vote_count": 6, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 187056, "name": "woman director"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/cADbqsIoiDW7X3Myg9nz8eAuno5.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 10749], "id": 10818, "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "Naissance des pieuvres", "overview": "Set during a sultry summer in a French suburb, Marie is desperate to join the local pool's synchronized swimming team, but is her interest solely for the sake of sport or for a chance to get close to Floriane, the bad girl of the team?
