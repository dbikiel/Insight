For six years the filmmaker worked with unprecedented access to some of the most venomous ideologies and violent conflicts of our time including the white supremacist movement, Christian Fundamentalism as an anti-gay platform, Muslim extremism, the Palestinian Intifada, Israeli settlers and soldiers, and US Forces in Iraq. By juxtaposing this verite footage with interviews from leading sociological, psychological, and neurological experts, and interspersing stories of redemption told by former \"combatants\", the film weaves a tapestry that reveals both the emotional and biological mechanisms which make all of us susceptible to acts and ideologies of hate, and demonstrates how these very same traits make us equally capable of overcoming them.", "popularity": 0.785, "poster_path": "/6h6QMvBIwbXF2cS3L2v0sEGH3aG.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2009-04-21", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 86, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Anatomy of Hate", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.7, "vote_count": 3, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "535397400e0a26560a004704", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1311534, "job": "Director", "name": "Mike Ramsdell", "profile_path": null}]}}
