From the historic site of Dubrovnik to the ancient sand dunes and rolling green hills of the seaside town of Balmedie, these tycoons bully local residents, influence governments, ignore local referendums and even meddle in national environmental policies to acquire their latest trophies. With in-depth interviews and Baxter\u2019s expert storytelling, we learn just how devastating these golf courses can be to the surrounding countryside and water tables. In this funny, inspiring and at times heartbreaking David and Goliath story for the 21st century, the locals don\u2019t give in easily. But will their fight be enough to protect their land and traditional way of life?", "popularity": 2.306, "poster_path": "/n1RpuMI8JKvUvd6uUJNZd5xbLST.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 23120, "logo_path": null, "name": "Montrose Pictures", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}, {"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}, {"iso_3166_1": "HR", "name": "Croatia"}], "release_date": "2014-05-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 102, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "Because power and money should not cost the earth", "title": "A Dangerous Game", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.7, "vote_count": 3, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 875, "name": "dubrovnik"}, {"id": 15228, "name": "golf course"}, {"id": 33480, "name": "environmental"}, {"id": 169086, "name": "political satire"}, {"id": 178026, "name": "environmental conservation"}, {"id": 178029, "name": "sustainable development"}, {"id": 178095, "name": "balmedie scotland"}, {"id": 178107, "name": "david and goliath"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 592739, "video": false, "vote_count": 51, "vote_average": 5.5, "title": "Cetto C'\u00e8", "release_date": "2019-11-21", "original_language": "it", "original_title": "Cetto c'\u00e8, senzadubbiamente", "genre_ids": [35], "backdrop_path": "/bzo9brPKm8lJgL2vqYmbvs1AFyd.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Third movie about the character of Cetto La Qualunque (Antonio Albanese)", "poster_path": "/5n5uCJQzFUMdBu3WkHhGBg2dhts.jpg", "popularity": 4.021}, {"id": 402897, "video": false, "vote_count": 877, "vote_average": 7.0, "title": "The Death of Stalin", "release_date": "2017-10-20", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Death of Stalin", "genre_ids": [35, 36], "backdrop_path": "/tx5TFMF85qU2Ug4TRIGQZbDpzFA.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "When tyrannical dictator Josef Stalin dies in 1953, his parasitic cronies square off in a frantic power struggle to become the next Soviet leader.
