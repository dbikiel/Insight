The Sanguiwon are responsible for the attire worn by royalty. Dol-Seok (Han Suk-Kyu) is the best master artisan in charge of royal attire. He views set rules as paramount to his job. Kong-Jin (Ko Soo) is a genius like designer, born with dexterity and an excellent sense. He was brought to the palace by nobleman Pan-Soo (Ma Dong-Seok) who first spotted his talent. The King (Yoo Yeon-Seok) and Queen (Park Shin-Hye) then become embroiled in a critical case because of the royal attire made by Dol-Seok and Kong-Jin.", "poster_path": "/mjndh3KmqMC13vtiSecOLksPsi4.jpg", "popularity": 4.247}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 5}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 0, "character": "Futaba Kono", "credit_id": "57b8abec92514118b1000aaf", "gender": 1, "id": 72494, "name": "Rie Miyazawa", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/2yfL6f9Epxf3FL2diu3w4YHGSQR.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "Azumi Kono", "credit_id": "57b8ac00c3a368295b000985", "gender": 1, "id": 1348015, "name": "Hana Sugisaki", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/zmK96HIOMDEYG4X8IM337otAYhY.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 1, "character": "Kazuhiro Kono", "credit_id": "57b8abf2c3a3682960000ae3", "gender": 2, "id": 63694, "name": "Joe Odagiri", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/dR7bz6PqdKiRVSbFPrhNavmr6kL.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "Takumi Mukai", "credit_id": "57b8ac0ac3a3682957000a86", "gender": 2, "id": 1105808, "name": "Tori Matsuzaka", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/mdzuQoQzais2VRVMntg7S5m8TLv.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 8, "character": "Ayuko Katase", "credit_id": "5903a5edc3a3684ad7000112", "gender": 0, "id": 1700138, "name": "Aoi Ito", "order": 4, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Kimie Sakamaki", "credit_id": "57b8ac1a92514118a8000b24", "gender": 0, "id": 1407396, "name": "Yukiko Shinohara", "order": 5, "profile_path": "/3797As8HURRMWtGb02ogLyIxR56.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Takimoto", "credit_id": "57b8ac259251411bf1000958", "gender": 2, "id": 1154045, "name": "Tar\u00f4 Suruga", "order": 6, "profile_path": "/u3XrKlhI3i7tnjdnSxNAkSr91AY.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 9, "character": "'Mean Girls' Leader", "credit_id": "5c97ddf20e0a2620efc06b60", "gender": 0, "id": 1770302, "name": "Nanoka Matsubara", "order": 7, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 10, "character": "Mr. Aso", "credit_id": "5c97ddfe9251416b3af5e165", "gender": 0, "id": 1770304, "name": "Kagetora Miura", "order": 8, "profile_path": null}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "5c97de380e0a264cbdc15f61", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 1084061, "job": "Casting", "name": "Tsuyoshi Sugino", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5852ce26c3a36806a70179a9", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 1147289, "job": "Screenplay", "name": "Ryota Nakano", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "57b8ac4892514118b1000ae4", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1147289, "job": "Director", "name": "Ryota Nakano", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5c97de739251411742f4fff3", "department": "Sound", "gender": 2, "id": 1553701, "job": "Original Music Composer", "name": "Takashi Watanabe", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5c97de629251416b33f5c879", "department": "Crew", "gender": 0, "id": 1716881, "job": "Cinematography", "name": "Yoshihiro Ikeuchi", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5c97de29c3a36877e639ea9c", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 1921917, "job": "Producer", "name": "Yusuke Wakabayashi", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5c97de1f925141186bf4fe87", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 2145115, "job": "Producer", "name": "Kazumi Fukase", "profile_path": null}]}}
