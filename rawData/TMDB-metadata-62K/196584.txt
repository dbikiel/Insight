In old-fashioned black and white, these faces stare into the empty space, in the 5:00 PM tiredness and mechanical impersonality, like faces from the grave. It's hard to believe that these faces belong to people today. The film is one of the strongest and grimmest comments upon the contemporary society that cinema has produced.\" - Jonas Mekas, The Village Voice", "poster_path": "/tz6kBdrZlcIvHzOvhFqZ5oDfA7W.jpg", "release_date": "1970-03-11", "title": "Necrology", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.9, "vote_count": 16, "popularity": 2.499}, {"id": 104275, "video": false, "vote_count": 15, "vote_average": 7.1, "title": "The Pit, the Pendulum and Hope", "release_date": "1983-07-28", "original_language": "cs", "original_title": "Kyvadlo, j\u00e1ma a nad\u011bje", "genre_ids": [16, 27, 9648], "backdrop_path": null, "adult": false, "overview": "A short film based on Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Pit and the Pendulum\" and Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam's \"A Torture by Hope\".", "poster_path": null, "popularity": 1.552}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99], "id": 189872, "original_language": "nl", "original_title": "De brug", "overview": "The Hefbrug, the subject of The Bridge, is not a specially beautiful or monumental bridge. But Ivens\u2019 achievement is to convey the importance of this bridge for the whole of Rotterdam. We have a sense of the commercial imperatives behind the bridge, and the intricacy of the mechanism needed to swing the bridge or raise the rail decking to allow ships to pass through. There is always a solid sense of context throughout the 14 minutes of the film. It opens with shots of a camera and cameraman, immediately establishing a point of view for what follows. Again we have a mix of close-ups, and long shots, bird\u2019s eye views and low angles. The sense of the bridge\u2019s structure, its ways of operating, how it fits into the overall transport infrastructure of the city \u2013 all are conveyed through the visuals.
