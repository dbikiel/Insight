The young man quickly realizes that he can hold this place, with all its perks, only as long as he is young. He has no other function than being young. With the help of an aged judge, the young man, referred to only as The Lover, contrives a plan to make a change in the way of the world, a plan that will take him years to realize. To succeed, he must manipulate, in subtle and not-so-subtle ways, the senator, his wife, the family chauffeur (who was, when young, a lover), and, by implication, the entire well-planned and controlling everlasting secret family.", "poster_path": "/iWOaiXSHnBsLfK0hEYZYtrCEUbk.jpg", "release_date": "1988-03-10", "title": "The Everlasting Secret Family", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.3, "vote_count": 4, "popularity": 2.273}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/lEgDsRngnt4pJ2w0OGWYz2T2ATy.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 18], "id": 65831, "original_language": "de", "original_title": "Sascha", "overview": "While Sasha's mother is dreaming of her son's great career as a pianist, Sasha is left speechless for other reasons: his beloved piano teacher Mr. Weber tells him, he is leaving town forever.
