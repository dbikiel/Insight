Europe was on tenterhooks in the 2nd decade of the 20th century, everyone was expecting a Great War between the major European powers. But then, in 1913, something crashed into the forests of SW Germany. Troops were sent to investigate but were wiped out. Martian fighting machines began making their way across Western Europe and the countries of Europe combined forces to resist them. With aspects taken from \u2018The War of the Worlds\u2019 by H.G. Wells and from WWI itself, this dramatisation presents a documentary style look at events as they unfolded and the effect they had of our world today. Lots of references to real events including the mass attacks and defeats as men were thrown against machines on the Western front, the Christmas truce and the Angel of Mons, America's isolationism and late entry into the conflict, the worldwide Spanish flu epidemic that killed more people than the war, and many other things.", "popularity": 3.793, "poster_path": "/n1saih6oGqd6qGUe2BLLSHG4QVS.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 51848, "logo_path": null, "name": "Entertainment One Television", "origin_country": "CA"}, {"id": 28099, "logo_path": null, "name": "Impossible Pictures", "origin_country": "GB"}], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2013-12-08", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 128, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Great Martian War 1913\u20131917", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.8, "vote_count": 5, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 10539, "name": "martian"}, {"id": 11800, "name": "mockumentary"}, {"id": 14909, "name": "alien invasion"}, {"id": 14946, "name": "fictional war"}, {"id": 210184, "name": "1910s"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/kormVYncbZMrToXaOV58o74LNIz.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 53, 878, 9648], "id": 2675, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Signs", "overview": "A family living on a farm finds mysterious crop circles in their fields which suggests something more frightening to come.", "poster_path": "/bY9lCUVUajpkKWlfjWF1mtXaSUp.jpg", "release_date": "2002-08-02", "title": "Signs", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 3222, "popularity": 16.898}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/vSDl3hqsxxNaj0tE5ZLsTQeL0dS.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 10752], "id": 975, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Paths of Glory", "overview": "A commanding officer defends three scapegoats on trial for a failed offensive that occurred within the French Army in 1916.", "poster_path": "/6lMXjI1O1N7XyZEjqIo5wkbrgxg.jpg", "release_date": "1957-09-18", "title": "Paths of Glory", "video": false, "vote_average": 8.3, "vote_count": 1350, "popularity": 16.678}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/msOjpu9wigi6n1Xa51MeLcBue88.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 36, 10752, 10749], "id": 468224, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Tolkien", "overview": "England, early 20th century.
