Two run a gas station on the outskirts of town, on a road that gets next to no traffic anymore, and so they get next to no customers. They live and work out of a decrepit van on site, its windows covered in plastic. Sadry is a former strongman, now blind in one eye. He is the boss of the station. Yadi is his eager to please assistant, who usually annoys more than pleases. Finally there is the postman, Abbas, who longs to trade in his break-less bicycle for a motorcycle, while he must care for his mentally ill brother.", "popularity": 0.963, "poster_path": "/wgkbHUoGn2V1fXrHBiVCUuIevPX.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "IR", "name": "Iran"}], "release_date": "2006-01-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 85, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fa", "name": "\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "A Few Kilos of Dates for a Funeral", "video": false, "vote_average": 8.0, "vote_count": 2, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "538e7dc1c3a36832d10005c3", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 1327333, "job": "Director", "name": "Saman Salur", "profile_path": null}]}}
