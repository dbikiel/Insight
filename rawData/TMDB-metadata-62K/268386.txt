A lover of Jesus and a rebel in the church, Rich refused to let his struggles with alcoholism, addiction and women tear him away from a God he was determined to love.  As he struggled with success in Nashville, depression in Wichita, and oblivion in the Four Corners, Rich became one of the first of his time to live honestly amidst a culture of religion and conformity.", "popularity": 2.673, "poster_path": "/JAjQcUFZVUef4VfdCgnIReZJZx.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2014-01-09", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 137, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "His life was a whirlwind.
