Soon after, a mental hospital was built on the ruins. The first patients to be committed were Holocaust survivors. A legend says that to this day, the survivors have been communicating with the ghosts of the village. Forgiveness tells the story of David Adler, a 20-year old American-Israeli who decides to move back to Israel, only to find himself committed to a mental institution that sits on the ruins of a Palestinian village called Deir Yassin. Flashbacks and flashforwards reveal the events that led up to his hospitalization.", "popularity": 1.83, "poster_path": "/8zeLG0rMdisgJuby8ClFA4Vmzpz.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "IL", "name": "Israel"}, {"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2006-08-08", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 97, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Forgiveness", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.5, "vote_count": 2, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "David", "credit_id": "5d330f5f6a300b1834ab403b", "gender": 2, "id": 110364, "name": "Itay Tiran", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/3xOPPaKVKHVyFRTuIKvnXALwTkZ.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "Lila", "credit_id": "5d330f7e2f8d094522d9ab12", "gender": 0, "id": 41645, "name": "Clara Khoury", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/nSHDTsu00ozkK6iEnI7Ax9Zr5au.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "Jakoov", "credit_id": "5d330f9d6a300b2f7ea4f82f", "gender": 2, "id": 562949, "name": "Moni Moshonov", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/9JigKYNNFDr0fx2k4toOY0J3mZq.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "5d330fcacaab6d1dfc9cbe44", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 1350832, "job": "Screenplay", "name": "Udi Aloni", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "53e46af0c3a368484d0030cb", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1350832, "job": "Director", "name": "Udi Aloni", "profile_path": null}]}}
