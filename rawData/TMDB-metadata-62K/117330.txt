Kazablan is an army veteran turned gang leader in the Israeli port of Jaffa who masks his feelings of bitterness with a lot of bravado. He's sweet on Rachel, a young woman who lives with her father and stepmother. The budding relationship scandalizes the neighbors (not to mention Rachel's parents) and infuriates Yanush, a middle-aged shoe store owner who wants Rachel for himself. (Yanush feels he's entitled to marry Rachel since they're both Ashkenazi Jews of Eastern European origins, whereas Kazablan is a Sephardic Jew from Morocco.) The neighborhood has something else to worry about besides the antics of Kazablan and his gang: the city wants to tear down their crumbling homes. The residents pool their resources to save their houses, but the money that's collected is stolen. When he's jailed for the theft, Kazablan must find a way to clear himself.", "popularity": 1.416, "poster_path": "/mYHZaXPNu8IU6j0HeTkyFPHXaFB.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 20023, "logo_path": null, "name": "Noah Films", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "IL", "name": "Israel"}], "release_date": "1974-01-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 122, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "he", "name": "\u05e2\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "An embittered gang leader seeks the respect of his neighbors and the love of a young woman", "title": "Kazablan", "video": false, "vote_average": 8.0, "vote_count": 3, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 4344, "name": "musical"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 224141, "video": false, "vote_count": 3144, "vote_average": 5.7, "title": "Into the Woods", "release_date": "2014-12-24", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Into the Woods", "genre_ids": [35, 14], "backdrop_path": "/lzJzB0QfkjpGCm9qUC4XpEIB6pm.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "In a woods filled with magic and fairy tale characters, a baker and his wife set out to end the curse put on them by their neighbor, a spiteful witch.", "poster_path": "/5h91odPFNlBuJbRBj5N4MEBfXDE.jpg", "popularity": 29.368}, {"id": 872, "video": false, "vote_count": 1617, "vote_average": 8.2, "title": "Singin' in the Rain", "release_date": "1952-04-10", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Singin' in the Rain", "genre_ids": [35, 10402, 10749], "backdrop_path": "/amW1YWQvcP8slDyDp1R652aVQZ7.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "In 1927 Hollywood, a silent film production company and cast make a difficult transition to sound.", "poster_path": "/s39odBPtyutGBnEfBIpdm0fpRwv.jpg", "popularity": 17.295}, {"id": 504608, "video": false, "vote_count": 1666, "vote_average": 7.4, "title": "Rocketman", "release_date": "2019-05-22", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Rocketman", "genre_ids": [18, 10402], "backdrop_path": "/sZZJ42GrWKxSOfcrpI2TSFQa0AQ.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "The story of Elton John's life, from his years as a prodigy at the Royal Academy of Music through his influential and enduring musical partnership with Bernie Taupin.", "poster_path": "/f4FF18ia7yTvHf2izNrHqBmgH8U.jpg", "popularity": 27.709}, {"id": 18126, "video": false, "vote_count": 1217, "vote_average": 6.4, "title": "Hannah Montana: The Movie", "release_date": "2009-04-10", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Hannah Montana: The Movie", "genre_ids": [35, 18, 10402, 10749, 10751], "backdrop_path": "/ezx3NkXNqf2KnJCP6Nfj1bfCFut.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "As Hannah Montana's popularity begins to take over her life, Miley Stewart, on the urging from her father takes a trip to her hometown of Crowley Corners, Tennessee to get some perspective on what matters in life the most.", "poster_path": "/8pwbnmvshHj2yYPYlyJ8K8Yzecy.jpg", "popularity": 12.479}, {"id": 2005, "video": false, "vote_count": 1806, "vote_average": 6.7, "title": "Sister Act", "release_date": "1992-05-28", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Sister Act", "genre_ids": [35, 10402], "backdrop_path": "/oaLqlJxt8TJSjsdfMpSkLexZ4l5.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A Reno singer witnesses a mob murder and the cops stash her in a nunnery to protect her from the mob's hitmen.
