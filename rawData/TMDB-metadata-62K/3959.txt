The comic confusion begins when Dagwood Bumstead (Arthur Lake), intending to buy a house, buys a horse instead.  Before the film's 75 minutes have run their course, Dagwood gets mixed up in a fox hunt.  But Blondie (Penny Singleton) saves the day as usual, with the help of eccentric millionaire Timothy Brewster (Hugh Herbert).  After It's a Great Life and #14 \"Footlight Glamour\", Columbia restored the name \"Blondie\" to the titles of all subesequent installments in this long-running comedy series.", "popularity": 1.399, "poster_path": "/6wESNXSgvDS7EID9HDlTBhG1njY.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 5, "logo_path": "/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png", "name": "Columbia Pictures", "origin_country": "US"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1943-05-27", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 72, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "It's a Great Life", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 190801, "name": "blondie"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/fPU0SAQCZN4PHEKzM95SO70LghU.jpg", "genre_ids": [35], "id": 3924, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Blondie", "overview": "Blondie and Dagwood are about to celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary but this happy occasion is marred when the bumbling Dagwood gets himself involved in a scheme that is promising financial ruin for the Bumstead family.", "poster_path": "/o6UMTE2LzQdlKVxRnFECPmtQjsJ.jpg", "release_date": "1938-11-30", "title": "Blondie", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 4, "popularity": 4.467}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/1ONmSpp9IPbdAEifC3bEXJ2W2d8.jpg", "genre_ids": [35], "id": 3938, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Blondie Plays Cupid", "overview": "The Bumstead family is off to see relatives in the country when Blondie runs into Charlie and Millie, an eloping couple needing her help.", "poster_path": "/sut85IUE5yuU1M3lKDq7vx0WCd5.jpg", "release_date": "1940-10-31", "title": "Blondie Plays Cupid", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 3, "popularity": 3.147}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/aZvWpg08BCqSNQKon9eyej98O0M.jpg", "genre_ids": [35], "id": 3936, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Blondie Has Servant Trouble", "overview": "Things get under way when Blondie Bumstead demands that her husband request a raise from his boss Mr. Dithers, so that she can afford to hire a maid.
