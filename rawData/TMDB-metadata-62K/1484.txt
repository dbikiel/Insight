However, orbiting the Earth there is the European/American space station FLORIDA ARKLAB, capable of controlling the weather at any location on the planet underneath.

No wonder the space station soon becomes the central point in rising political tensions between East and West, next stop World War 3 (as indicated by the tagline \"The end of our future has already begun\"). We follow the main protagonist Billy Hayes, an astronaut aboard the station, as he wades through a plot of secrecy and sabotage trying to tell friend from foe in the process.", "poster_path": "/ee1djwXS75P834QHmTBtC5xdxQ0.jpg", "popularity": 3.189}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 13}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 13, "character": "Fritz Haarmann", "credit_id": "52fe42f9c3a36847f8030e4d", "gender": 2, "id": 26395, "name": "G\u00f6tz George", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/nQEmtmexfWayo6mrSkjuDSsUpYD.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 14, "character": "Prof. Dr. Ernst Schultze", "credit_id": "52fe42f9c3a36847f8030e51", "gender": 2, "id": 23523, "name": "J\u00fcrgen Hentsch", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/hPjeRDIryV9U95SwkxKMy8Q9yiK.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 15, "character": "Kommisar Raetz", "credit_id": "52fe42f9c3a36847f8030e55", "gender": 2, "id": 35263, "name": "Hans-Michael Rehberg", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/9UzyPF3vKlsEEk5hWgqYMGXTDjo.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 16, "character": "Stenograph", "credit_id": "52fe42f9c3a36847f8030e59", "gender": 0, "id": 36177, "name": "Pierre Franckh", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/7lXPSramUrpaX7WOYw5hn68Cflb.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 17, "character": "Dr. Machnik", "credit_id": "52fe42f9c3a36847f8030e5d", "gender": 2, "id": 23379, "name": "Matthias Fuchs", "order": 4, "profile_path": "/oWo3VkcCXwLV1yGRwHKZZn1whC9.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 18, "character": "Kress", "credit_id": "52fe42f9c3a36847f8030e61", "gender": 0, "id": 36178, "name": "Marek Harloff", "order": 5, "profile_path": "/ixYk2i0qJXuFJjBDkqemjHQ9k4m.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 19, "character": "Arzt", "credit_id": "52fe42f9c3a36847f8030e65", "gender": 0, "id": 36179, "name": "Christian Honhold", "order": 6, "profile_path": null}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe42f9c3a36847f8030e07", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 17280, "job": "Director", "name": "Romuald Karmakar", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe42f9c3a36847f8030e0d", "department": "Writing", "gender": 2, "id": 17280, "job": "Screenplay", "name": "Romuald Karmakar", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe42f9c3a36847f8030e13", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 36174, "job": "Screenplay", "name": "Michael Farin", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe42f9c3a36847f8030e19", "department": "Production", "gender": 2, "id": 17280, "job": "Producer", "name": "Romuald Karmakar", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe42f9c3a36847f8030e1f", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 2360, "job": "Producer", "name": "Thomas Sch\u00fchly", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe42f9c3a36847f8030e25", "department": "Production", "gender": 2, "id": 36175, "job": "Producer", "name": "Gebhard Henke", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe42f9c3a36847f8030e2b", "department": "Production", "gender": 2, "id": 13736, "job": "Producer", "name": "Christian Granderath", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe42f9c3a36847f8030e31", "department": "Production", "gender": 2, "id": 36176, "job": "Executive Producer", "name": "Peter Herrmann", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe42f9c3a36847f8030e37", "department": "Camera", "gender": 2, "id": 3659, "job": "Director of Photography", "name": "Fred Schuler", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe42f9c3a36847f8030e3d", "department": "Editing", "gender": 2, "id": 2309, "job": "Editor", "name": "Peter Przygodda", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe42f9c3a36847f8030e43", "department": "Art", "gender": 2, "id": 24428, "job": "Production Design", "name": "Toni L\u00fcdi", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe42f9c3a36847f8030e49", "department": "Costume & Make-Up", "gender": 0, "id": 22182, "job": "Costume Design", "name": "Peri de Bragan\u00e7a", "profile_path": null}]}}
