In addition, the documentary offers a rare glimpse into the process John goes through to create and compose his music. Featured in the film are musicians Neil Young, Brian Wilson, Booker T. Jones, steel guitarist Robert Randolph, Don Was and a 10-piece gospel choir who all contribute to the album, which is produced by award-winning producer T-Bone Burnett. Musician Stevie Nicks and John's long-time lyricist Bernie Taupin also appear.", "popularity": 1.598, "poster_path": "/pHtJkK3G190wD4uTRVtOq1HClng.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2012-01-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 87, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Union", "video": false, "vote_average": 10.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "52fe4a50c3a36847f81c6f35", "gender": 2, "id": 11370, "name": "Elton John", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/bFQvidUsrWfWo4ZI7oZgTnB8Zb6.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "52fe4a50c3a36847f81c6f39", "gender": 0, "id": 84914, "name": "Leon Russell", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/3QwaNyUYAZF0AZYIs54ZHak9Unq.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "52fe4a50c3a36847f81c6f3d", "gender": 2, "id": 1483, "name": "T Bone Burnett", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/xK2Cw6ryClj4gcXscwnZfzkaTN3.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4a50c3a36847f81c6f43", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 11649, "job": "Director", "name": "Cameron Crowe", "profile_path": "/eWHjtfUybkQ5xXI5KUICuGmkvc3.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "5b2a75a5c3a36855f500798a", "department": "Production", "gender": 2, "id": 228643, "job": "Co-Producer", "name": "Morgan Neville", "profile_path": "/gi8kgpBsyEh7AFboSoL1AI5dOhE.jpg"}]}}
