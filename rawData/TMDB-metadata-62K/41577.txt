Whilst on the island, Hirosuke not only discovers Jogoro's plans to build his 'ideal community' (by transforming perfectly normal humans into hideous freaks), but also the awful truth behind his own identity.", "poster_path": "/qMGvXjxbWgh5t10f3B7Obr8TUpL.jpg", "release_date": "1969-10-31", "title": "Horrors of Malformed Men", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.7, "vote_count": 15, "popularity": 4.912}, {"id": 12580, "video": false, "vote_count": 45, "vote_average": 6.2, "title": "Izo", "release_date": "2004-08-21", "original_language": "ja", "original_title": "IZO", "genre_ids": [28, 18, 14, 36, 27, 10752], "backdrop_path": "/nTGJ3oX4b3ZB8RKlxCB3YlPFQO2.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Izo is an assassin in the service of a Tosa lord and Imperial supporter.
