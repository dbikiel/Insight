Afraid of what may happen to them if their strict (but somewhat inattentive) parents or any of the rather straight-laced teachers at their Catholic school find out about the baby, Arturo and Paloma turn to their young friends and relatives for help instead. This proves to be something of a coming-of-age for everyone involved as they try to help the young couple get married, conceal the pregnancy from their parents, and prepare for the birth. The many adventures they have while doing this, while often amusing, help drive home to them that the old wives' tale about storks bringing babies is just a myth (hence the title), and pregnancy and childbirth are actually very serious matters.", "poster_path": "/c2Op1SYwpNDXjkzQ3Mfltkpt7sr.jpg", "release_date": "1971-09-05", "title": "Adi\u00f3s, cig\u00fce\u00f1a, adi\u00f3s", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.8, "vote_count": 4, "popularity": 1.612}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [18], "id": 448546, "original_language": "es", "original_title": "Tacos altos", "overview": "The abuse endured by an indomitable prostitute does not kill her spirit in this drama based on short stories by Bernardo Kordon. Luisa (Susu Pecoraro) and her older sister Herminda (Ana Maria Picchio) are streetwalkers in Buenos Aires, but very different in their attitudes. Where Herminda is blithely frank about her job, Luisa is not as casual. On a trip home to bring her mother and little brother to the city (to help care for Herminda's baby), Luisa is viciously gang-raped by her former boyfriend and his cohorts -- but she endures. She eventually gets a job in a massage parlor but is fired when she nixes a client -- and she still endures, back on the streets again. Her sister scorns her, her new boyfriend dumps her, a dear friend is murdered -- yet Luisa never gives in to despair. Popular at the Argentine wickets, this drama has much going for it -- in particular a woman who is a victim but denies it with no problem at all.", "poster_path": "/mXLtbqpJ4ZWbHWMa2lpuWeFOMbI.jpg", "release_date": "1985-09-05", "title": "High Heels", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 3, "popularity": 1.019}, {"id": 31943, "video": false, "vote_count": 54, "vote_average": 6.9, "title": "Emperor of the North Pole", "release_date": "1973-05-23", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Emperor of the North Pole", "genre_ids": [28, 12, 18, 53], "backdrop_path": "/4upudpAITtzUa3N5QJ1VqFkBxYr.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Hobos encounter a sadistic railway conductor that will not let anyone \"ride the rails\" for free.", "poster_path": "/zH4vp5yKeu3anUa6mpVPmit2VSu.jpg", "popularity": 5.747}, {"id": 89092, "video": false, "vote_count": 6, "vote_average": 6.0, "title": "Hostile Witness", "release_date": "1968-11-01", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Hostile Witness", "genre_ids": [18], "backdrop_path": "/eCiRQTVMdv05fwreFHrrvYOGKKK.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Simon Crawford is a barrister whose daughter is killed in a hit-and-run accident.
