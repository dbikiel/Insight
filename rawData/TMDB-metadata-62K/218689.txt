He and his wife take their son to a clinic, where he is diagnosed by a talented psychologist (Stevie), as being autistic. After catching his unfaithful wife with another man, Dean tells Lucy to leave, and is faced with the task of raising Shane on his own. Stevie believes that she can improve Shane's condition, going back to Dean's apartment and later convincing him that he can provide a better world for his son. Angelo, who lives in the same apartment building and is like a father to Dean, urges on the relationship, sensing that Stevie is luring Dean away from backstreet dealings, and giving him courage to face life in a positive way. Together, they build a foundation for a better life outside of the violence and danger of the backstreets where they live.", "popularity": 3.467, "poster_path": "/sDhLDHPgYoGtuACQ3AqW3P5YJVA.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 4063, "logo_path": null, "name": "Trimark Pictures", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1990-09-29", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 96, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Backstreet Dreams", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 2, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 1646, "name": "autism"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/pQvqotL0tjP6kuNoxq7eAPXicrk.jpg", "genre_ids": [28, 80, 18, 53], "id": 8838, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Mercury Rising", "overview": "Renegade FBI agent Art Jeffries protects a nine-year-old autistic boy who has cracked the government's new \"unbreakable\" code.", "poster_path": "/2vEQLyrH0uKgjvLzYmYc9coNrgI.jpg", "release_date": "1998-04-03", "title": "Mercury Rising", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 751, "popularity": 16.413}, {"id": 380, "video": false, "vote_count": 3520, "vote_average": 7.7, "title": "Rain Man", "release_date": "1988-12-11", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Rain Man", "genre_ids": [18], "backdrop_path": "/eZ4Aj1O6E95Mk5O9oKKdvfnSWzf.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Selfish yuppie Charlie Babbitt's father left a fortune to his savant brother Raymond and a pittance to Charlie; they travel cross-country.", "poster_path": "/vllKYkA7eYi2UMM9yWQ1JegefBh.jpg", "popularity": 15.591}, {"id": 64685, "video": false, "vote_count": 1342, "vote_average": 7.0, "title": "Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close", "release_date": "2011-12-24", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close", "genre_ids": [18], "backdrop_path": "/cSaXqhEIAXK6sVKMoGvxuhEYDe4.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A year after his father's death, Oskar, a troubled young boy, discovers a mysterious key he believes was left for him by his father and embarks on a scavenger hunt to find the matching lock.", "poster_path": "/EEf53z7xAUZzUHA5KVHVVLwgnQ.jpg", "popularity": 15.232}, {"id": 22051, "video": false, "vote_count": 256, "vote_average": 6.8, "title": "Adam", "release_date": "2009-07-07", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Adam", "genre_ids": [18, 10749], "backdrop_path": "/s6QYPPOeHbFZ3BwF9c8jxMkvzli.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Adam, a lonely man with Asperger's Syndrome, develops a relationship with his upstairs neighbor, Beth.", "poster_path": "/BAxxFF4bO7okLBnrtWM7vE2zzs.jpg", "popularity": 9.144}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/bHdiwZJzEuVASlGJeAguZEl7XPj.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 6936, "original_language": "nl", "original_title": "Ben X", "overview": "Harassed by bullies because of his mild autism, teen Ben (Greg Timmermans) finds refuge in an online computer game, which leads him to his virtual dream girl, Scarlite (Laura Verlinden).
