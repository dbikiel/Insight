The monotony is broken one day when he interrogates Kwan Ping Man (Nick Cheung), a nervous, profanity-spouting man caught spying in the women's bathroom. Kwan, who seems to have more than a few screws loose, confides to Tsim a shocking secret: a ring of women conspiring to murder men. Everyday, plans are whispered in restrooms and deaths are carefully engineered, so that men die unnoticeably from \"accidents\" that are anything but. Tsim initially dismisses Kwan's conspiracy theory, but then clues crop up suggesting there is something fishy at work. Both his marriage and life could be at stake as Tsim becomes increasingly obsessed with cracking the case.", "popularity": 3.164, "poster_path": "/1bavZtdHxNCJrNpZnB01BMoFK09.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "HK", "name": "Hong Kong"}], "release_date": "2007-09-13", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 94, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "cn", "name": "\u5e7f\u5dde\u8bdd / \u5ee3\u5dde\u8a71"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "Behind every conspiracy lies an incredible truth.", "title": "Exodus", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.6, "vote_count": 8, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 153146, "video": false, "vote_count": 3, "vote_average": 5.3, "title": "Short Time", "release_date": "2005-08-18", "original_language": "ko", "original_title": "\uc774\ub300\ub85c, \uc8fd\uc744 \uc21c \uc5c6\ub2e4", "genre_ids": [28, 35], "backdrop_path": "/1USXjejSLbxKp0zp0DiPrU5NyVA.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Lee Dae-ro Can't Die (\uc774\ub300\ub85c, \uc8fd\uc744 \uc21c \uc5c6\ub2e4, also known as Short Time) is a 2005 South Korean action film about a corrupt police officer who is told he has only three months to live, and plots his own death so his wife can collect his insurance policy.", "poster_path": "/8xA0BZuCG7SaWJao9CHTwnuz7MG.jpg", "popularity": 0.932}, {"id": 45305, "video": false, "vote_count": 6, "vote_average": 5.8, "title": "Love Battlefield", "release_date": "2004-01-01", "original_language": "cn", "original_title": "\u611b\u00b7\u4f5c\u6230", "genre_ids": [28, 18, 10749], "backdrop_path": "/6AOpGuZ4bTlBugwPJx6TyZ1aOOD.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "The story of a couple (Niki Chow and Eason Chan) who break up one morning and proceed to find their love tested in unexpected and violent ways.", "poster_path": "/8C8ZDZc46iDNseqX6wXDJK7ey7P.jpg", "popularity": 2.777}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/lZaeiCE3wepRMq3oUnTtQfqHS4g.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 35, 10749], "id": 83830, "original_language": "ko", "original_title": "\ud488\ud589\uc81c\ub85c", "overview": "When Joong-Pil, the biggest bully in his high-school by far finds himself harboring feelings for a classmate, his entire identity is thrown off balance.
