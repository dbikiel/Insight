They're in the middle of their marital troubles, and at the start of the film are in a bind- will they split for falling out of love, or stay for their child? Soon though, as the child gets a little older, the father leaves, and the mother becomes the primary parent of the intelligent, eccentric, and funny (in a 'French' sort of way) pre-teen. The film is highlighted with a terrific bit of music from Gustav Mahler (the scene itself is surreal when you first see it, but thinking about it it makes sense from the point of view of a kid), and a quiet scene with the daughter and her father late in the film.", "poster_path": "/kZ8KuvSdAeC95klwoaI3IYIFgb2.jpg", "popularity": 1.02}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/4ZsEg8WZNCudJ9QrFLMYQP7F7M4.jpg", "genre_ids": [80, 9648, 53], "id": 55603, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Charlie Chan in The Golden Eye", "overview": "A gold mine in Arizona, that was formerly losing a lot of money, suddenly turns into a veritable money-making machine.
