Elaine Stritch at Liberty is an autobiographical one-woman show written by Elaine Stritch and John Lahr, which is composed of anecdotes from Stritch's life and showtunes.  The show consists of spoken monologues from Stritch following her life and career, interspersed with showtunes and pop standards which compliment her stories. Many of these songs had been previously sung by Stritch in major productions, such as \"The Ladies Who Lunch\" from Company and \"Civilization\" from Angel in the Wings which she originated on Broadway. Her experiences and relationship with show business are focal points, but she also explores more intimate, personal themes like her alcoholism and romantic relationships.", "popularity": 3.515, "poster_path": "/9uoucM9yfmAYICtNMRHYxCVoWCO.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 3086, "logo_path": "/iksa7hXQMvPIzfSq0Tuo4WPU8gc.png", "name": "Image Entertainment", "origin_country": "US"}, {"id": 24487, "logo_path": null, "name": "Pennebaker Hegedus Films, Inc.", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 71837, "logo_path": null, "name": "Second Act Productions", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 101186, "logo_path": null, "name": "Iambic Productions", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 3268, "logo_path": "/tuomPhY2UtuPTqqFnKMVHvSb724.png", "name": "HBO", "origin_country": "US"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}, {"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2004-05-29", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 140, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "Legendary performances come along so rarely.", "title": "Elaine Stritch: At Liberty", "video": false, "vote_average": 10.0, "vote_count": 3, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 2660, "name": "strong woman"}, {"id": 2751, "name": "career woman"}, {"id": 4344, "name": "musical"}, {"id": 4463, "name": "icon"}, {"id": 5565, "name": "biography"}, {"id": 6415, "name": "stage show"}, {"id": 7464, "name": "alcoholism"}, {"id": 9961, "name": "live comedy"}, {"id": 156028, "name": "broadway"}, {"id": 185482, "name": "actress"}, {"id": 188582, "name": "london theater district"}, {"id": 190481, "name": "broadway star"}, {"id": 193300, "name": "one woman show"}, {"id": 193537, "name": "stage performance"}, {"id": 198192, "name": "humor show"}, {"id": 198362, "name": "broadway actor"}, {"id": 206597, "name": "stage musical"}, {"id": 221828, "name": "stage production"}, {"id": 228296, "name": "stage actress"}, {"id": 230318, "name": "live theater"}, {"id": 241625, "name": "diabetes"}, {"id": 246884, "name": "filmed theater"}, {"id": 253269, "name": "live theatre"}, {"id": 254001, "name": "live audience"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 504608, "video": false, "vote_count": 1666, "vote_average": 7.4, "title": "Rocketman", "release_date": "2019-05-22", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Rocketman", "genre_ids": [18, 10402], "backdrop_path": "/sZZJ42GrWKxSOfcrpI2TSFQa0AQ.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "The story of Elton John's life, from his years as a prodigy at the Royal Academy of Music through his influential and enduring musical partnership with Bernie Taupin.", "poster_path": "/f4FF18ia7yTvHf2izNrHqBmgH8U.jpg", "popularity": 27.709}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/ppDnBvf0f7vCZHRLtDjazpYHdTF.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 10402, 10749], "id": 13368, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "White Christmas", "overview": "Two talented song-and-dance men team up after the war to become one of the hottest acts in show business.
