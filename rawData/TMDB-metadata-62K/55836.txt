A slacker before there was a word for it, Andrzej (played by Skolimowski himself) drifts through a series of open-ended encounters with women following a wake-up argument with his pouting wife, and a long-delayed military physical (the film\u2019s title derives from one of the questions). Skolimowski hoarded four years\u2019 worth of the annual film footage allotment from his L\u00f3dz film school in order to create this first feature marked by compositional bravado and a trademark air of the absurd. -Barbara Scharres, Gene Siskel Film Center", "poster_path": "/7ZmHXX3W7mSMK6JqMCyPtxDFgQV.jpg", "release_date": "1965-11-18", "title": "Identification Marks: None", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 7, "popularity": 2.114}, {"id": 10244, "video": false, "vote_count": 9, "vote_average": 5.7, "title": "Gods of the Plague", "release_date": "1970-07-24", "original_language": "de", "original_title": "G\u00f6tter der Pest", "genre_ids": [18], "backdrop_path": "/nhWSJTYVnYS7CmRAjJ6eMayLzOo.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A man is released from prison and finds the society on the outside less than appealing.

Admiral Horthy, leader of the nationalist far right movement, becomes the self-proclaimed regent of Hungary, and assumes power as the legal Head of State. Soldiers of the short-lived Hungarian Red Army are now on the run from relentless secret policemen and patrol units of the nationalist Royal Gendarme. If caught, ex-Red Army soldiers are executed without mercy or proper trial.

The final symbolic images of Spring, achieved through time-lapse photography, are almost unbearably beautiful. The winner of several festival awards, Farrebique nonetheless did not immediately result in an outpouring of financing for Rouqier's follow-up films (this was a common problem in the financially strapped French film industry of the 1940s).
