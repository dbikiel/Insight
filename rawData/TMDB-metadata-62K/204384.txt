The more I was shocked about how the disabled were depicted in this film the more I started to realize that in every non-disabled TV counterpart of this show (German TV shows like \"Popstars\" or \"Friedmann\" or the home shopping channels) its mentally \"non-handicapped\" participants are treated in a completely identical way: The total prostitution of the mind in front a huge TV audience at the expense of one's most important gifts one should hang on to: dignity. On the other hand one could completely understand people who are furious about \"exploiting\" these handicapped persons. But that's what Schlingensief's works are all about: shock people and don't care about those who cannot or will not try to get the message (if there is one).", "poster_path": "/jLRCPyT7ArpMNbzQmcUV59mkhkK.jpg", "popularity": 1.357}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/oz1yuDd4G8Y30NOPdnHqXFIfz8H.jpg", "genre_ids": [10770, 35], "id": 212503, "original_language": "de", "original_title": "K\u00f6nig von Deutschland", "overview": "", "poster_path": "/3bi8b8gLzIMNQVg2ft2jSAOj8qz.jpg", "release_date": "2013-09-04", "title": "King Ordinary", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.8, "vote_count": 28, "popularity": 3.935}, {"id": 140554, "video": false, "vote_count": 25, "vote_average": 6.9, "title": "Fraktus - Das letzte Kapitel der Musikgeschichte", "release_date": "2012-11-06", "original_language": "de", "original_title": "Fraktus - Das letzte Kapitel der Musikgeschichte", "genre_ids": [35, 10402], "backdrop_path": "/6gU5ScIdZd6bP0AOkK27rXInOBD.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "", "poster_path": "/2pThyBOA43DS9YUxHDDUcWiF7EU.jpg", "popularity": 4.844}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/u2Ry2w6gMyap200878CYywmTi4X.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 18, 10402], "id": 9690, "original_language": "de", "original_title": "Verschwende deine Jugend", "overview": "No overview found.", "poster_path": "/46U0iMYGVLyNLhf3GvRO2ddeRO0.jpg", "release_date": "2003-07-03", "title": "Verschwende deine Jugend", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.7, "vote_count": 9, "popularity": 3.24}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/5eIwKjHhgGkG0CqhG2T2DFMDGxG.jpg", "genre_ids": [99, 18], "id": 324064, "original_language": "de", "original_title": "H\u00e4rte", "overview": "Half documentary, half docu-drama about a German karate champion, who used to be a successful pimp...", "poster_path": "/j5sZn4aI3QwlgIBWvXebpbQAyWO.jpg", "release_date": "2015-04-23", "title": "Tough Love", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.8, "vote_count": 6, "popularity": 1.895}, {"id": 81375, "video": false, "vote_count": 4, "vote_average": 6.5, "title": "Rent Boys", "release_date": "2011-12-07", "original_language": "de", "original_title": "Die Jungs vom Bahnhof Zoo", "genre_ids": [99], "backdrop_path": "/2hUl557HAo02IBNWqsuAqwehZr3.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Documentary about the current hustler scene in Berlin.

Realising public xenophobia and the new hate politics in the most drastic ways possible, he installed a public concentration camp right in the middle of Vienna's touristic heart, right beside the picturesque opera where hundreds of tourists and locals pass by daily.
