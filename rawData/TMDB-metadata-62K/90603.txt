He quickly found success as one of the creators of the Pee-wee's Playhouse TV show which soon led to more work designing some of the most arresting and iconic images in pop culture.

The movie chronicles the vaulted highs and crushing lows of an artist struggling to find peace and balance between his professional work and his personal art. This is especially complicated for a man who struggles with the virtues he most often mocks in his art...Vanity, ego and fame.", "popularity": 1.671, "poster_path": "/mrbQoNhL6TsWNi6s95fkxrzyRB5.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 58637, "logo_path": "/yLSNxhJzLwYS0OZmLGjwnPcUGUT.png", "name": "Tremolo Productions", "origin_country": "US"}], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2012-09-07", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 88, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Beauty Is Embarrassing", "video": false, "vote_average": 8.1, "vote_count": 9, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [35], "id": 161522, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Fatty Joins the Force", "overview": "Fatty rescues the daughter of the police commisioner and is given a job as an officer as a reward, but its not all its cracked up to be!", "poster_path": "/plcmXq0kjPRKgfiCSOH5l6p1UOW.jpg", "release_date": "1913-11-23", "title": "Fatty Joins the Force", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.3, "vote_count": 4, "popularity": 1.418}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/kcksV3DvHFgdiwUC0XHYI86eUdc.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 10749, 35], "id": 26941, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Afterglow", "overview": "A handyman with marital problems meets a housewife with the same.", "poster_path": "/l1oF4ef36A4EuJFtSZ4X2mXfT03.jpg", "release_date": "1997-12-26", "title": "Afterglow", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 8, "popularity": 4.301}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [18, 10749], "id": 86955, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Body and Soul", "overview": "A minister is malevolent and sinister behind his righteous facade.

Along the way, Charlie inhabits a city full of moments of violence and of stories and legends: a kidney thief, a microwaved poodle, a rat in a hot dog bun, a baby left on a car top, a tourist's toothbrush, needles in public-phone change slots.
