Jump ahead ten years: the dad is dead, the mom is gone, and the son, Luke, is raising his now grown sister, Annie. He's overprotective, and she seems blood simple, a coquette and an innocent. He runs the diner in town, and one day, Lisa, a callow writer-to-be, comes through from Manhattan, keeping a journal, looking for interesting people. She takes a shine to Annie and then to the muscular and well-read Luke. But what is their secret, how many of the townsfolk are in on it, and what will Lisa do when it all becomes clear?", "popularity": 1.259, "poster_path": "/7RxFvdeTEIYW1cvVaIzJp1KnjW5.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 58073, "logo_path": null, "name": "JLM Productions", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1997-10-14", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 97, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Annie's Garden", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 0, "character": "Luke Thomas", "credit_id": "55a3af789251412977005309", "gender": 0, "id": 19717, "name": "Keith Coulouris", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/maEsRcZN6XHdurXyGO1WyhGktGF.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 1, "character": "Lisa Miller", "credit_id": "55a3af95c3a3681cde0050fc", "gender": 1, "id": 20759, "name": "Yancy Butler", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/emcS8cLp5aEEMdJS4Am0TLiX6WA.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "Annie Thomas", "credit_id": "55a3afb492514129740055a7", "gender": 1, "id": 55957, "name": "Charlotte Chatton", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/vhV0qc6leXokgUo0DnkpKYJIeCR.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "Mrs. Barnes", "credit_id": "55a3afd1c3a3681ce30057b0", "gender": 1, "id": 6465, "name": "Grace Zabriskie", "order": 4, "profile_path": "/19tr5IbzCmv4x5B3WFlG1RQPwXu.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "55a3b0119251412977005316", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 19717, "job": "Writer", "name": "Keith Coulouris", "profile_path": "/maEsRcZN6XHdurXyGO1WyhGktGF.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "58271cc39251417b2101a3c7", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 1123910, "job": "Director", "name": "Anthony Barnao", "profile_path": null}]}}
