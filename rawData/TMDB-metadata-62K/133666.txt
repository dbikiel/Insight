In a nation that appears uncertain how to feel about its own history with exploitation film and generally reluctant to embrace genre film - though there are obvious exceptions - Karacadag has jumped headlong into the horror pool.

Both film showcased Karacadag's growing ability to shock and terrify his audiences by taking the rich folklore of his country and pushing it to its dark extremes. And he's at it again with D@BB: Bir Cin Vakasi.
