His girlfriend, Alice, is his rock, but the magazine she writes for is going down and the pressure is on to find a story.  While job hunting online, David stumbles across the perfect antidote to his boredom: a \u2018Swingers\u2019 site. The resulting inbox of lewd invitations on the home-laptop justifiably upsets Alice, until she realises this could be just the \u2018story\u2019 she needs.  The idea of uncovering the swinging scene causes quite a stir in Alice\u2019s office and, much to David\u2019s chagrin, she is urged to pursue the story.  Their first reluctant foray is an hysterically low-rent initiation, however, an unexpected upturn for David\u2019s manhood is all the extra encouragement they need.
