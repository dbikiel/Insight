Poised between good and evil, mankind was, in Kubrick's view, a complex creature equally capable of unspeakable savagery and heart-melting tenderness. Full Metal Jacket would make his case in vivid, blood-soaked Technicolor. Through interviews with Kubrick's collaborators and cast members, including Vincent D'Onofrio, Lee Ermey and Adam Baldwin, this documentary reveals how Kubrick's brilliant visual sense, astute knowledge of human nature, and unique perspective on the duality of man came together to make Full Metal Jacket an unforgettable cinematic experience, taking its place in his \"war trilogy\" alongside cinematic landmarks Fear and Desire and Paths of Glory.", "popularity": 1.4, "poster_path": "/4U80YjNGIJYdJe3RkzB7BA3lNCd.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2007-01-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 31, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Full Metal Jacket: Between Good and Evil", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.5, "vote_count": 2, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "56e054e8925141657e0001e2", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 223388, "job": "Director", "name": "Gary Leva", "profile_path": null}]}}
