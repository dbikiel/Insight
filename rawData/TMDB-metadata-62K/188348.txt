Reagan saw first-hand the brutality, destruction and oppression that defined the communist party as it attempted to overtake the unions to convert them into propaganda mills for the Soviet Union. The strike incited in him a call to action and an unshakeable belief that communism was a \"form of insanity\" which must be wiped from the earth. From SAG President, to GE Spokesman, Governor of California and finally, to President of the United States, this film chronicles the rise of Ronald Reagan, his unwavering conviction that America was the world's last best hope of man, and shows why he is hero to over a billion people who he helped free from the bonds of Soviet domination.", "popularity": 0.702, "poster_path": "/5AeaZ6agMfpU67IsDHKTSTASyz5.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 47466, "logo_path": null, "name": "Renegade Productions", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 47467, "logo_path": null, "name": "Bannon Films", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 47468, "logo_path": null, "name": "Leo McWatkins", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2004-10-01", "revenue": 110577, "runtime": 107, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "In the Face of Evil: Reagan's War in Word and Deed", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 840, "name": "u.s. president"}, {"id": 8646, "name": "ronald reagan"}, {"id": 11482, "name": "republican"}, {"id": 210738, "name": "pro republican"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/4bHX7nAmjMiZO9eotJITyro0raw.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 376866, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Jackie", "overview": "An account of the days of First Lady, Jacqueline Kennedy, in the immediate aftermath of John F.
