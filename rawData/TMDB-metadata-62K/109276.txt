Taking its title (as a reference or homage) from Alain Resnais\u2019 pivotal 1956 documentary Nuit et Brouillard, the film has a group of former student revolutionaries who meet again years later at the wedding of one of their classmates. Old feelings, rivalries and grudges gradually erupt to the surface as the one-time friends recall the various treacheries by which their cause was defeated. Cutting between times past and the present, and unfolding the action from each of his characters viewpoints, Oshima creates an abstract and yet engrossing study of passions past and principles eroded. \u2014Yume Pictures", "popularity": 2.712, "poster_path": "/kyAkQTo4tNPrKJGSPdPGAwsFvph.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 192, "logo_path": "/93eAKlnQecDdMtucfOprzcjMw9V.png", "name": "Shochiku Co., Ltd.", "origin_country": "JP"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "JP", "name": "Japan"}], "release_date": "1960-10-09", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 107, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ja", "name": "\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "Arthouse", "title": "Night and Fog in Japan", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.8, "vote_count": 4, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 209998, "name": "japanese new wave"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/8KnYYyDJZlxkNKWvtlVAPX5xvD2.jpg", "genre_ids": [80, 18, 28, 35], "id": 31104, "original_language": "ja", "original_title": "\u8c5a\u3068\u8ecd\u8266", "overview": "In the city of Yokosuka, Kinta and his lover Haruko, both involved with yakuza, brave the post-occupation period with a goal to be together.", "poster_path": "/u7fbMQSE5OMKYKOXbSAp5WOJRBj.jpg", "release_date": "1961-01-21", "title": "Pigs and Battleships", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.7, "vote_count": 29, "popularity": 4.513}, {"id": 88527, "video": false, "vote_count": 19, "vote_average": 6.7, "title": "Cruel Story of Youth", "release_date": "1960-06-03", "original_language": "ja", "original_title": "\u9752\u6625\u6b8b\u9177\u7269\u8a9e", "genre_ids": [18, 10749], "backdrop_path": "/xL4E1BDXWK6GqDMKVynOitwBNdR.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A budding gangster enthralls a freeloading young woman, soon taking advantage of her knack for hitch-hiking to rob middle-class, middle-aged men.", "poster_path": "/6GkI0qAwCIWKWoVuXKU9iaxiHsR.jpg", "popularity": 2.334}, {"id": 111718, "video": false, "vote_count": 8, "vote_average": 6.6, "title": "The Sun's Burial", "release_date": "1960-08-09", "original_language": "ja", "original_title": "\u592a\u967d\u306e\u5893\u5834", "genre_ids": [18], "backdrop_path": "/jiJiLVvIlUCezwryP13G2swtJBb.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "In Osaka's slum, youths without futures engage in pilfering, assault and robbery, prostitution, and the buying and selling of identity cards and of blood.
