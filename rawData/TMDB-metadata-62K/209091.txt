Burton soon regrets his agreement, however, when her pill-popping and lack of discipline causes problems already during the rehearsals. The play opens to a critical trashing, but is popular with audiences because they just want to see Taylor.  After a two month troubled run, the curtain comes down and Taylor tells Burton she has always loved him and still does.
