Famous for their quiet, beautiful slow songs, and fascinating harmonies, as well as their religious background (core members Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker are Mormons). For this documentary, a film crew followed Alan and Mimi on tour, at home in Duluth, MN, in their church community, and as parents. It's more than an on-the-road or behind-the-scenes video. It shows Sparhawk as the ambivalent main character in an intriguing movie about religion, violence, conscience, and madness. It can also be seen as a touching love story.", "popularity": 0.6, "poster_path": "/1KIRN3UVwF0OjnQlFiNyiSkYAGN.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2008-06-04", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 70, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Low: You May Need a Murderer", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.3, "vote_count": 2, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "", "credit_id": "52fe4e4ec3a36847f828923f", "gender": 0, "id": 1200254, "name": "Alan Sparhawk", "order": 0, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "", "credit_id": "52fe4e4ec3a36847f8289243", "gender": 0, "id": 1200255, "name": "Mimi Parker", "order": 1, "profile_path": null}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4e4ec3a36847f8289249", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1028273, "job": "Director", "name": "David Kleijwegt", "profile_path": null}]}}
