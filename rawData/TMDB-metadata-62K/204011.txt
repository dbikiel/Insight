As portrayed by the film, Shukhevych is a genteel family man who is also a complex character (revolted by ethnic discrimination, a music lover and a military genius) that with his charisma fuels his countrymen with desire for freedom. In the end, Shukhevych's efforts are unable to defeat the Soviets despite paying for his resistance with his life, but they re-enforce Ukrainian patriotism as an underground force until Ukraine finally recovers its freedom from Soviet tyranny.", "popularity": 0.621, "poster_path": "/6XsDzAjOvZuAuYSlvZ5ihFBhwLX.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2000-11-13", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 104, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ru", "name": "P\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439"}, {"iso_639_1": "uk", "name": "\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "Heroes never die...", "title": "The Undefeated", "video": false, "vote_average": 8.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "Roman Shukhevych", "credit_id": "52fe4cebc3a368484e1ccd41", "gender": 0, "id": 141741, "name": "Gregory Hlady", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/nflwPaKuyIR6LMCqSH8G1FMxSlj.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4cebc3a368484e1ccd47", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1186332, "job": "Director", "name": "Oles Yanchuk", "profile_path": "/dMBANWga57VY0os4xbB5QHW2ymp.jpg"}]}}
