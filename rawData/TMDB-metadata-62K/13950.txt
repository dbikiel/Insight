Reggie Wright (Epps) is a slippery con artist who is avoiding the law, and Jackson. During a cat and mouse chase, the two stumble on a multi-million dollar diamond heist. Hiding from Jackson, Wright finds himself in the thieves' getaway van and ends up having to escape from them after they discover their booty is fake, much to the displeasure of their ruthless boss (Flanagan). When Wright meets up with his girlfriend (Mendes), he discovers that his recently purchased lottery ticket is the sole winner of $60 million. Unfortunately, his wallet, which held the ticket, was left in the thieves' van, so he persuades Jackson to help him get it back.", "popularity": 13.248, "poster_path": "/MnD3ueM3Kh6mxTT9oqw9fhxSzd.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 12, "logo_path": "/iaYpEp3LQmb8AfAtmTvpqd4149c.png", "name": "New Line Cinema", "origin_country": "US"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2002-03-08", "revenue": 25482931, "runtime": 95, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}, {"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "Money can make people do funny things.", "title": "All About the Benjamins", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 85, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 633, "name": "record store"}, {"id": 738, "name": "sexuality"}, {"id": 3019, "name": "autograph"}, {"id": 3508, "name": "underwear"}, {"id": 5918, "name": "painting"}, {"id": 8430, "name": "safe"}, {"id": 11190, "name": "sexual attraction"}, {"id": 14735, "name": "motorcycle"}, {"id": 14857, "name": "juvenile delinquent"}, {"id": 54169, "name": "stoner"}, {"id": 156825, "name": "music store"}, {"id": 158304, "name": "hand on crotch"}, {"id": 163994, "name": "raised middle finger"}, {"id": 167925, "name": "employer employee relationship"}, {"id": 169151, "name": "cupcake"}, {"id": 169152, "name": "twenty something"}, {"id": 169161, "name": "money bag"}, {"id": 169171, "name": "sidewalk"}, {"id": 169175, "name": "storem"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 12225, "video": false, "vote_count": 569, "vote_average": 6.9, "title": "Cashback", "release_date": "2006-09-10", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Cashback", "genre_ids": [35, 18, 10749], "backdrop_path": "/4gT26M9G85HI76D9ZGDHyRx4OfE.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "After a painful breakup, Ben develops insomnia.
