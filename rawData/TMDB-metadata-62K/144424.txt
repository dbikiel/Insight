This informal little project once again shows the joy Cocteau takes in creating art, in addition to showing a side of his work (his paintings and drawings) that his films often overshadow.", "poster_path": "/n2LKAz18YwTbb5d0DmY8BZxtWQ4.jpg", "release_date": "1952-12-05", "title": "La Villa Santo Sospir", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.6, "vote_count": 7, "popularity": 0.976}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [18], "id": 193900, "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "Le myst\u00e8re des roches de Kador", "overview": "Count Fernand De Keramic plots against his niece in order to acquire her wealth to pay his debts.", "poster_path": "/ytgrpH76wVMm6btu2OHUgclFGcy.jpg", "release_date": "1912-12-01", "title": "The Mystery of the Rocks of Kador", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 8, "popularity": 0.951}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 195617, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "It's a Bird", "overview": "Charlie, working on a junkjard, always trying to help people in the most impossible ways with junk from his work place, hears from a German professor, that there is a bird, a Belgish Kongo, that eats metal.
