Rouqier concentrates on a single French farm family, following them through the four seasons. As in the works of Robert Flaherty, the human characters and the land surrounding them are \"one\", and Rouqier never misses an opportunity to parallel their lives with the eons-old phases of nature. The final symbolic images of Spring, achieved through time-lapse photography, are almost unbearably beautiful. The winner of several festival awards, Farrebique nonetheless did not immediately result in an outpouring of financing for Rouqier's follow-up films (this was a common problem in the financially strapped French film industry of the 1940s). Perhaps as a result, Rouqier did not make his sequel, Biquefarre (filmed in the same region, with some of the same \"actors\"), until 1983.", "poster_path": "/rx81Dh44AxQnTtDJqrlFPptvJk5.jpg", "release_date": "1946-09-01", "title": "Farrebique, or the Four Seasons", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 1.586}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/uAZ5XDtTia90mOiQxK9bn6j3N1T.jpg", "genre_ids": [80, 18], "id": 51467, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Shed No Tears", "overview": "A man listens to his wife and fakes his own death so that she can get her hands on his insurance policy.", "poster_path": "/o5FlBWb9oeEUB9j0KUHwrVhip6t.jpg", "release_date": "1948-06-09", "title": "Shed No Tears", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.3, "vote_count": 11, "popularity": 3.932}], "total_pages": 2, "total_results": 40}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 4, "character": "Henri Danglard", "credit_id": "52fe46b5c3a36847f810de31", "gender": 2, "id": 11544, "name": "Jean Gabin", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/pmFuOVTQvYdgmN7cYOuyJHPfMRt.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Nini", "credit_id": "52fe46b5c3a36847f810de35", "gender": 1, "id": 36318, "name": "Fran\u00e7oise Arnoul", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/ES2Tz51D8dR4itwtnF9JVZS910.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 17, "character": "Lola de Castro de la Fuente de Espramadura 'La Belle Abbesse'", "credit_id": "56ae6947c3a3681c5400a416", "gender": 1, "id": 996588, "name": "Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/pJyLpjMuIdToUB5KPyEvgd1QROW.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 7, "character": "Esther Georges", "credit_id": "52fe46b5c3a36847f810de39", "gender": 0, "id": 132491, "name": "Anna Amendola", "order": 3, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 8, "character": "Baron Walter", "credit_id": "52fe46b5c3a36847f810de3d", "gender": 2, "id": 36917, "name": "Jean-Roger Caussimon", "order": 4, "profile_path": "/fpUbw6f9v3cSqs0WzUmR4nHGKNY.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 9, "character": "La G\u00e9nisse", "credit_id": "52fe46b5c3a36847f810de41", "gender": 1, "id": 25166, "name": "Dora Doll", "order": 5, "profile_path": "/uEosUxO9KXng6ru4l2owh0HuILh.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 10, "character": "Prince Alexandre", "credit_id": "52fe46b5c3a36847f810de45", "gender": 0, "id": 37130, "name": "Giani Esposito", "order": 6, "profile_path": "/ePHTfAMDezlAnD78teWH1m6Wj58.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 19, "character": "Le Capitaine Valorgueil", "credit_id": "56ae6a5a9251416498002544", "gender": 2, "id": 3784, "name": "Michel Piccoli", "order": 7, "profile_path": "/gz91b4tVn6yYsKemek2YkUdjlSH.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 18, "character": "Eug\u00e9nie Buffet", "credit_id": "56ae6a3fc3a3681c34009531", "gender": 1, "id": 1091908, "name": "\u00c9dith Piaf", "order": 8, "profile_path": "/q7D2JmdE9BwdJZNcy68OUjF8j3H.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 21, "character": "Paulo, le boulanger", "credit_id": "5a9c5eae0e0a2605f2037a8e", "gender": 0, "id": 227316, "name": "Franco Pastorino", "order": 9, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 22, "character": "The singer", "credit_id": "5bb4868d925141781500b14c", "gender": 1, "id": 2140554, "name": "Cora Vaucaire", "order": 10, "profile_path": "/uxMlrXa6YIe83A2Mc8SVBSwgs7p.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 23, "character": "Paquita", "credit_id": "5bb486d7c3a3687afa00e3da", "gender": 1, "id": 2099146, "name": "Anne-Marie Mersen", "order": 11, "profile_path": "/lWQEzcdjvEMxwLyO13pGcLPn27.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "552c3059c3a368618e000831", "department": "Art", "gender": 2, "id": 10473, "job": "Production Design", "name": "Max Douy", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe46b5c3a36847f810de21", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 11528, "job": "Director", "name": "Jean Renoir", "profile_path": "/oN93wdY94BIVDQVbFfHGOBCk3L.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "52fe46b5c3a36847f810de27", "department": "Writing", "gender": 2, "id": 11528, "job": "Adaptation", "name": "Jean Renoir", "profile_path": "/oN93wdY94BIVDQVbFfHGOBCk3L.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "55d0ea0ac3a3687757001881", "department": "Writing", "gender": 2, "id": 11528, "job": "Writer", "name": "Jean Renoir", "profile_path": "/oN93wdY94BIVDQVbFfHGOBCk3L.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "552c3038c3a3686190000836", "department": "Sound", "gender": 2, "id": 12262, "job": "Original Music Composer", "name": "Georges Van Parys", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "552c3070c3a36861a100089d", "department": "Costume & Make-Up", "gender": 1, "id": 14237, "job": "Costume Design", "name": "Rosine Delamare", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "59b08a36925141078a07b4d6", "department": "Camera", "gender": 2, "id": 70855, "job": "Director of Photography", "name": "Michel Kelber", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe46b5c3a36847f810de2d", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 132489, "job": "Idea", "name": "Andr\u00e9-Paul Antoine", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "552c302a9251416ac000049e", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 1453876, "job": "Producer", "name": "Louis Wipf", "profile_path": null}]}}
