Brand spotlights not only how the crisis affected the working class around the world, but also how the uber-wealthy benefited from the downturn. With Winterbottom providing his signature ingenuity and pinpoint directorial control, they generate a riveting, boisterous, and, at times, cathartic riff on the extreme disparities between the haves and have nots in contemporary society.", "popularity": 3.437, "poster_path": "/1cTKwKCiIzkXtz5PI5D68AFJy96.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2015-04-24", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 107, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Emperor's New Clothes", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 18, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99], "id": 185515, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "John & Jane", "overview": "A fresh new blend of observational documentary and tropical science-fiction, JOHN &amp; JANE follows the stories of six call agents that answer American 1-800 numbers in a Mumbai call center.
