After years of coexisting in a love-hate relationship marked by routine and possible incest, Andor brings home Eszter, a beautiful girl his own age. Her advances awaken Andor's repressed desires, the depths of which prove shocking. Opera director Robert Alfoldi renders this bizarre story in a melodramatic style, and veteran Hungarian stage star Dorottya Udvaros rises to the occasion. If you can imagine the intersecting area on a Venn diagram that includes Taxidermia and Sunset Blvd., that's where Where Were You, My Son? was born. The original title, Nyugalom, which translates to Tranquility, is ironic to say the least. ...over the-top...memorable...thunderous...sex and violins (Variety).", "popularity": 0.909, "poster_path": "/dSnPWM4Di1TJMn7Sixd97GUJ4YK.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "HU", "name": "Hungary"}], "release_date": "2008-02-21", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 115, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "hu", "name": "Magyar"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Where Were You, My Son?", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 3, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/AutumdLrBxl5inwwaQoKY5Tw1QK.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 10749], "id": 49622, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Passion of Ayn Rand", "overview": "The rather eccentric (especially in her thinking) author of \"The Fountainhead\" and \"Atlas Shrugged\" becomes involved with a much younger, and married man... to the dismay of those close to her.", "poster_path": "/bSudsCHq4z5jVl08nEq1OhMAzeC.jpg", "release_date": "1999-01-27", "title": "The Passion of Ayn Rand", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.7, "vote_count": 6, "popularity": 2.511}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 1}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 3, "character": "We\u00e9r Rebeka", "credit_id": "52fe4b6ec3a368484e1889db", "gender": 0, "id": 123943, "name": "Dorottya Udvaros", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/kWYMsZqDQH1no38w8xdK7YwAZxO.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "We\u00e9r Andor", "credit_id": "52fe4b6ec3a368484e1889df", "gender": 0, "id": 1092702, "name": "Zal\u00e1n Makranczi", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/hXbfgiGQdNj9nR2m2ig1Bvl6L2C.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Feh\u00e9r Eszter", "credit_id": "52fe4b6ec3a368484e1889e3", "gender": 1, "id": 19998, "name": "Dorka Gryllus", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/8zcJcSoP3uZtgKe8WvBgMueaNHO.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 6, "character": "Jord\u00e1n \u00c9va", "credit_id": "52fe4b6ec3a368484e1889e7", "gender": 0, "id": 125383, "name": "Judit Hern\u00e1di", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/iIUM6vhoD47iLy3UcYh739N2ahs.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4b6ec3a368484e1889d1", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1092701, "job": "Director", "name": "R\u00f3bert Alf\u00f6ldi", "profile_path": "/iqlhAntoLeVjnxDPMbR4i4XBPCP.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "52fe4b6ec3a368484e1889d7", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 1092701, "job": "Writer", "name": "R\u00f3bert Alf\u00f6ldi", "profile_path": "/iqlhAntoLeVjnxDPMbR4i4XBPCP.jpg"}]}}
