How she handles the chaos and her despair in her first semester makes up the film: a promising student drops out, another sleeps through class, a girl with a crush on a male teacher gets suicidal, and a bright but troublesome student misunderstands Sylvia's reaching out. A discussion of Dickens, parents' night, and a mock trial highlight the term.

Carroll Baker portrayed an actress inspired by Jean Harlow, who appeared in Hughes' film epic Hell's Angels. The Carpetbaggers was directed by Edward Dmytryk, filmed in 70mm, and was Alan Ladd's final film; Ladd died some months before its release.In the movie, George Peppard plays a hard-driven industrialist more than a little reminiscent of Howard Hughes. While he builds airplanes, directs movies and breaks hearts, his friends and lovers try to reach his human side, and find that it's an uphill battle. The film's title is a metaphor for self-promoting tycoons who perform quick financial takeovers, impose dictatorial controls for short-term profits, then move on to greener pastures.", "poster_path": "/7Ph47GM9W6EUvvMNwVMqbH4Ru8x.jpg", "release_date": "1964-04-08", "title": "The Carpetbaggers", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.6, "vote_count": 13, "popularity": 4.879}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/uMsfvqqglFGLFeRe3QmlpeNUDyr.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 35, 10749], "id": 72613, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "What Price Glory", "overview": "Two military men, Captain Flagg and Sergeant Quirt, who are rivals to begin with, grow more at odds with each other when Quirt is made Flagg's top sergeant.
