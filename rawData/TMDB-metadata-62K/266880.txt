Set in some demented alternate universe (i.e. Ventura, California), they are populated by real-life alcoholics and drug addicts, trash-talking senior citizens and trailer park residents dressed in cow outfits and costume-shop wigs, acting out booze-fueled vignettes filtered through Giuseppe's John Waters-meets-Harmony Korine-meets-Werner Herzog sensibility.  Director Adam Rifkin (Look, The Dark Backward) creates a wildly surreal, outrageously funny and strangely touching portrait of a truly Outsider Artist inhabiting a world few of us even know exists, as he follows Giuseppe and his seriously impaired troupe on the production of his latest 2-day opus, Garbanzo Gas, starring Vietnam Ron as a Cow given a weekend reprieve from the slaughterhouse at the local motel.  An Official Selection of Hot Docs 2014, Los Angeles Film Festival (LAFF) and the Rooftop Films Summer Series.", "popularity": 2.657, "poster_path": "/84wEpo82TdGQV8yO7bv1yNw3wtf.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2014-04-28", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 82, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "WARNING: THIS FILM CONTAINS SENIOR CITIZEN NUDITY AND DEAD PIGS", "title": "Giuseppe Makes a Movie", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.1, "vote_count": 5, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "536064eec3a36860e5000588", "gender": 2, "id": 4133, "name": "Giuseppe Andrews", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/tWAjcA240TR9x4GqGKj2gL4p68B.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "536064cdc3a36860ae000527", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 50583, "job": "Director", "name": "Adam Rifkin", "profile_path": "/ziyYZONebvj3E6W5jetiJnH6LtH.jpg"}]}}
