Belson notes the influence of his study and practice of Yoga and Tibetan Buddhism on the creation of Samadhi.  The film is inspired by the principles of yogic meditation: the movement of consciousness towards samadhi (union of subject and object), the fusion of atma (breath and mind), a state which reveals the divine force of kundalini, a bright white light we discover at the end of Samadhi. The Tibetan Book of The Dead is the inspiration behind Belson\u2019s use of colour in Samadhi, corresponding to descriptions of the elements of Earth, Fire, Air and Water in the book. \u2014Sophie Pinchetti, The Third Eye", "poster_path": "/2b5LyNdW6UYDji0R2u9BGTF1WW2.jpg", "release_date": "1967-12-31", "title": "Samadhi", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 10, "popularity": 1.4}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [16], "id": 146986, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Fuji", "overview": "A live action footage of a smiling, bespectacled (presumably) Western tourist set against the familiar cadence of an accelerating train revving up as it leaves the station sets the mesmerizing tone for the film's abstract panoramic survey of an Ozu-esque Japanese landscape of electrical power lines, passing trains, railroad tracks, and the gentle slope of obliquely peaked, uniform rooflines as Breer distills the essential geometry of Mount Fuji into a collage of acute angles and converging (and bifurcating) lines .", "poster_path": "/pBcigTWySqPfv2WWzf23xIKuhuE.jpg", "release_date": "1974-12-31", "title": "Fuji", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.3, "vote_count": 12, "popularity": 1.586}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 151336, "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "Impatience", "overview": "Experimental film evoking the notion of impatience through a man riding his motorbike on the roads of a mountainous landscape while the naked body of a woman appears in parallel.", "poster_path": "/9nqbItHGeereP4eYNjVg67N0XtJ.jpg", "release_date": "1928-01-01", "title": "Impatience", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.2, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 1.4}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/ekopPVrPJ72ucXZYFBA2NlFgivK.jpg", "genre_ids": [], "id": 93496, "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "Visa de censure n\u00b0 X", "overview": "Shot in 1967 but not released until 1975, actor Pierre Cl\u00e9menti\u2019s acid-infused experimental whirlwind of colour and music featuring a who\u2019s who of the French 60s underground.", "poster_path": "/seoX7gBwsddm6canbsXTnxbqxjF.jpg", "release_date": "1976-06-26", "title": "Visa de censure n\u00b0 X", "video": false, "vote_average": 8.2, "vote_count": 6, "popularity": 1.531}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 260213, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Runs Good", "overview": "A darkish journey down memory lane, to visit some news events, folkways and thought patterns associated with the late forties and early fifties.
