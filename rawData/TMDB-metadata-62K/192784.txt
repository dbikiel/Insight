The film is set during the tumultuous 1960s, an era when everyone's values were turned inside out, shaken around, and reassembled. The central character is first-generation American Craig Wasson, who confounds his Yugoslavian father (Miklos Simon) by pursuing his own let-it-all-hang-out lifestyle. Wasson's best friends are athlete Jim Metzler and chubby Michael Huddleston; all pursue the affections of bewitching Jodi Thelan. Though they are obviously deeply in love with one another, Wasson and Thelan continue to foolishly avoid a long-term commitment as the sixties unfold around them. Four Friends calls for a fresher approach than the one offered by director Arthur Penn, whose handling of the material is much too pat and old-fashioned.", "poster_path": "/xCuGYk8j0xPAskBCifLapyk1QlV.jpg", "release_date": "1981-12-11", "title": "Four Friends", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.4, "vote_count": 10, "popularity": 2.704}, {"id": 67753, "video": false, "vote_count": 13, "vote_average": 6.5, "title": "Le Schpountz", "release_date": "1938-04-15", "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "Le Schpountz", "genre_ids": [35], "backdrop_path": "/88KrYfrCWB9b3ZXcHPvh3QTlkgt.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A pompous grocer\u2019s assistant in Marseille annoys a visiting film crew so much that they prank him with a phony acting contract; believing it to be real, the \u201cschpountz\u201d heads to Paris for his new career.", "poster_path": "/bY4bF8NIXOeqd9uN0m83pNv8ZLp.jpg", "popularity": 2.008}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/9HREAq2wdLm1RorV7f9GO11PiDK.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 18], "id": 64294, "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "Entr\u00e9e des artistes", "overview": "Fran\u00e7ois, C\u00e9cilia and Isabelle are students of the drama class of the Conservatoire led by Professor Lambertin.
