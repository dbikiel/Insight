Deep pillows and Alaskan spines, all filmed at night, with massive lights, custom made LED suits, and a national governments worth of logistics, planning, and civil engineering. Filmed as a partnership between Sweetgrass Productions, Philips TV, and the Swedish Agency Ahlstrand & W\u00e5llgren, it's two parts creativity, one part branded content, and a pinch of masochism for good measure. Overall, it's an incredibly unique partnership between our vision of skiing and the color and light technology behind the Philips Ambilight TV.", "popularity": 0.658, "poster_path": "/boRgloB7H7icWLgiDyrdc90FRdl.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 19469, "logo_path": "/9J7UPjnJ0AanK0BJLYKmikrVUS1.png", "name": "Sweetgrass Productions", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2014-10-19", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 12, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Afterglow", "video": false, "vote_average": 9.0, "vote_count": 2, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "5a68e90a0e0a260d61005380", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1680261, "job": "Director", "name": "Nick Waggoner", "profile_path": null}]}}
