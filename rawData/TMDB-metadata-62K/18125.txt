Two schoolgirls have a sexual fling with a married man. Serious and light-hearted by turns. Rita, Sue And Bob Too was adapted by Andrea Dunbar from two of her own controversial plays.  Rita (Siobhan Finneran) and Sue (Michelle Holmes) are two teenagers living on a run-down council estate in Bradford who both share a job babysitting for Bob (George Costigan) and Michelle's (Lesley Sharp) children.  Whilst giving them a lift home one night, Bob decides to take Rita and Sue up to a deserted, country-side landscape.  Clearly knowing what he has in mind, Rita and Sue are only too happy to oblige and both have a sexual encounter with him that becomes a regular occurrence.  Despite the blatant politically-incorrect nature of the film, this does emerge as a somewhat controversial, though enduringly amusing film that has a sharp, gritty undertone.", "popularity": 4.248, "poster_path": "/bNofq5QmwFeFTILeUOzwG9hPe1X.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 181, "logo_path": "/zhQ77XOviCBuXd74IurqqjgLNe0.png", "name": "Channel Four Films", "origin_country": "GB"}, {"id": 3453, "logo_path": null, "name": "Umbrella Films", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "1987-05-20", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "Thatcher's Britain with her knickers down", "title": "Rita, Sue and Bob Too", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.3, "vote_count": 26, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 572, "name": "sex"}, {"id": 5215, "name": "northern england"}, {"id": 9180, "name": "yorkshire"}, {"id": 11513, "name": "cheating husband"}, {"id": 11516, "name": "sexual promiscuity"}, {"id": 13130, "name": "teenager"}, {"id": 14669, "name": "older man younger woman relationship"}, {"id": 34117, "name": "cult film"}, {"id": 41172, "name": "schoolgirl"}, {"id": 191071, "name": "cheat on wife"}, {"id": 219833, "name": "married man"}, {"id": 229299, "name": "affair"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/yIszPJawrrp6zcb62d7XJnaxAmw.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 13078, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Babysitters", "overview": "Seventeen-year-old Shirley is a good student who works as a babysitter in order to make money for college.
