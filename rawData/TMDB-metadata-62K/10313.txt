When a fellow police officer disappears and Boyle's small town becomes key to a large drug trafficking investigation, he is forced to at least feign interest when dealing with the humorless FBI agent Wendell Everett assigned to the case.", "poster_path": "/iUHePguAaumQGvf3rlXHHAkAMoh.jpg", "popularity": 15.21}, {"id": 11699, "video": false, "vote_count": 592, "vote_average": 6.1, "title": "The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call - New Orleans", "release_date": "2009-09-11", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call - New Orleans", "genre_ids": [80, 18], "backdrop_path": "/gRiIVeHX0Qbe4R41RpMahLWsP3V.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Terrence McDonagh, a New Orleans Police sergeant, who starts out as a good cop, receiving a medal and a promotion to lieutenant for heroism during Hurricane Katrina.
