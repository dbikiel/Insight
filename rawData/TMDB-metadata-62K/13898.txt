Less a documentary than a visual poem, Teshigahara's Antonio Gaud\u00ed takes viewers on a tour of Gaud\u00ed s truly spectacular architecture, including his massive still-unfinished masterpiece, the Sagrada Familia cathedral, in Barcelona.

Teddy then rides out of the forest followed by two companions afoot, never mind that they all originally arrived afoot. Perhaps it was funnier in its day than it is now, but apparently shooting cats was regarded as funny in those days.
