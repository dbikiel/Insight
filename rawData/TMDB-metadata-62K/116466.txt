And even reveals some secrets that should have probably remained untold...", "popularity": 1.176, "poster_path": "/mucl72ixUUivYpNtBqh3bhkgVjL.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2011-07-11", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 97, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}, {"iso_639_1": "he", "name": "\u05e2\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Flat", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 11, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 184184, "name": "bauhaus"}, {"id": 184185, "name": "german jew"}, {"id": 184187, "name": "tel aviv israel"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/iDA6lx2AxwXef25L8nqBE1EzxIS.jpg", "genre_ids": [878, 16, 28], "id": 78807, "original_language": "xx", "original_title": "Rosa", "overview": "Rosa is an epic sci-fi short film that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where all natural life has disappeared.
