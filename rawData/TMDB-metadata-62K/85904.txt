Garrel, 23 when he made the film, was compared with Jean Vigo because of his age and talent. La cicatrice int\u00e9rieure even led Claude Mauriac to call him the Rimbaud of film.

Along their journey they are captured and held in a POW camp, and they call for help from their friends and relations in France. Director Jean-Luc Godard presents stories about this troop to ask how one can make art while slaughters like the one in Bosnia are taking place, and he throws in a strong critique of the European Union. For Ever Mozart is one of Godard's most disjointed and difficult films. Its stories sometimes seem to form a whole and at other times the links among them are unclear. One gets the impression that in each episode Godard attempts to start a film only to come to the conclusion that it is impossible to continue. It features some of the most beautiful shots of tanks in the cinema.", "poster_path": "/5weHXHumddh7s2f1h9A7xJDSJXB.jpg", "release_date": "1996-11-27", "title": "For Ever Mozart", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 0.855}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/yXRIookmLEGwTEUNVxvb6DH15yl.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 14, 27], "id": 68757, "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "La Ville des pirates", "overview": "A surreal odyssey in which a melancholic maidservant crosses paths with a homicidal little boy, travels to a tiny island of pirates and encounters a man with multiple personalities.", "poster_path": "/wPBGVsccnlzMXaljxrhuq6pyD3H.jpg", "release_date": "1984-02-22", "title": "City of Pirates", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.6, "vote_count": 14, "popularity": 2.222}, {"id": 211486, "video": false, "vote_count": 4, "vote_average": 8.0, "title": "The Days I Don\u2019t Exist", "release_date": "2003-10-08", "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "Les jours o\u00f9 je n'existe pas", "genre_ids": [18, 14], "backdrop_path": "/1fc4IUud8Sfe7SHMNYdOU7BVnhu.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "While some people disappear forever, Antoine only exist one day out of every two.
