Combining unseen archival 16mm footage of the march shot by Kartemquin founder Gordon Quinn with the participants\u2019 reflections today, \u201963 Boycott connects the forgotten story of one of the largest northern civil rights demonstrations to contemporary issues around race, education, school closings, and youth activism.", "popularity": 0.6, "poster_path": "/5tohcvN4VAz7zCjCVQZVh7I6TbQ.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 13042, "logo_path": "/k57hcv8sELrZCf1j33FDBNGDpF6.png", "name": "Kartemquin Films", "origin_country": "US"}], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2016-11-06", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 30, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "'63 Boycott", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "5b26f529c3a36841f301653c", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 224497, "job": "Director", "name": "Gordon Quinn", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5b26f5bec3a36841cf0177bc", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 2067020, "job": "Producer", "name": "Rachel Dickson", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5b26f6009251410d6001583b", "department": "Production", "gender": 0, "id": 2067021, "job": "Producer", "name": "Tracye Matthews", "profile_path": null}]}}
