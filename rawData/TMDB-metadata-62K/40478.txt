Not Reconciled remains one of the most important German film of the past fifty years.", "poster_path": "/yf55EliFlzSUKsciMWtzs83F7wi.jpg", "popularity": 3.041}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/zmUqUobVYUlue0a4ipJXXkixNiK.jpg", "genre_ids": [53], "id": 124614, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "O Convento", "overview": "The journey of Michael Padovic, an American professor who arrives with his wife, Helene, at a Portuguese convent where he expects to find the documents needed to prove his theory: Shakespeare was born in Spain; not in England.", "poster_path": "/2M9br9Paerph1tAlbLuJadIqlqI.jpg", "release_date": "1995-09-06", "title": "The Convent", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 9, "popularity": 3.127}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/neqZew2pahZQGepq2oMLFDofkbk.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 131792, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "At Sea", "overview": "Three segments depicting the life cycle of a freighter boat.", "poster_path": "/kys23FFRsQuhltdYj6KcpG32XAt.jpg", "release_date": "2007-09-07", "title": "At Sea", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.8, "vote_count": 10, "popularity": 3.067}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/nf8qkUmcF2I0HGc8Lruw6JtY93.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 83232, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Portrait of Jason", "overview": "Interview with Jason Holliday aka Aaron Payne.
