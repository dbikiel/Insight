Deanna's boyfriend is deeply threatened by Sean and Deanna's friendship, resulting in a violent confrontation. Seeking to protect himself, Sean issues a death threat online - and is swiftly arrested. When the police raid Sean's home, they find rifles, shotguns, knives and ammunition - all property of Sean's father Ricky (Michael Buie), an avid hunter. They also find a supposed \"hit list\" with twenty names of people who have tormented Sean. The authorities and the media proclaim another Columbine has been narrowly averted, and soon Sean faces a terrifying imprisonment in a youth detention facility. Sean's only hope is to overcome his dark image, and prove his innocence to Deanna and to his community.", "poster_path": "/yCMxlZp8gq77rvXTWC6Qm2XTXKb.jpg", "release_date": "2012-09-09", "title": "Blackbird", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.7, "vote_count": 29, "popularity": 3.767}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/vLr9CHmjeEkQkd8azHObX8LO8ko.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 18], "id": 50590, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Norman", "overview": "A teenager pretends to be dying from cancer as a way to cope with the realities of his daily existence and his father's terminal illness.", "poster_path": "/hxD1AZ37exyCiOm8MvZp2sewRYC.jpg", "release_date": "2010-06-11", "title": "Norman", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 27, "popularity": 4.234}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/xXebq71oygZrxlnDoqOGzxOCxvn.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 27, 10749], "id": 105531, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Jack & Diane", "overview": "Jack and Diane, two teenage girls, meet in New York City and spend the night kissing ferociously.
