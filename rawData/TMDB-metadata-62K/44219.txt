The film illustrates the nature of the Yemeni revolution in stark contrast to the gross violations of human rights that took place on Friday, March 18th 2011. Juma'at El-Karama (Friday of Dignity) marks a turning point in the Yemeni revolution as the tragic events that took place on this day -when pro-government snipers shot dead 53 protestors - shook the nation and propelled hundreds of thousands more to flock to the square in solidarity with their fellow citizens. Through the lenses of two cameramen and the accounts of two fathers, the film retells the story of the people behind the statistics and news reports, encapsulating the tragic events of the day as they unfolded.", "poster_path": "/fTP7vMSdRiCBF89bgepVJbzJOpp.jpg", "release_date": "2012-03-01", "title": "Karama Has No Walls", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 4, "popularity": 1.356}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [878, 16, 35], "id": 206919, "original_language": "fi", "original_title": "Star Wreck IV: The Kilpailu", "overview": "In Star Wreck IV: The Kilpailu (\"kilpailu\" is Finnish for \"competition\"), several new characters were introduced, now drawn by Rudi Airisto.
