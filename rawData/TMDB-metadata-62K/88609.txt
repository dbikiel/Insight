He then took many months to edit his footage, while the company fumed and demanded a finished product. Finally he submitted a film, 90 seconds long, that featured extremely rapid cutting (cutting at the limits of most viewers' perception) between images washed out almost to the point of abstraction \u2014 in black-and-white positive and negative and with red tint \u2014 of dimly visible people drinking beer and of the froth of beer seen in a fully abstract pattern.", "poster_path": "/8yQ7YWFaihcGBj4nbLHpdsEvMeL.jpg", "release_date": "1958-12-31", "title": "Schwechater", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.7, "vote_count": 26, "popularity": 3.046}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 154612, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Birth of Magellan: Cadenza I", "overview": "Hollis Frampton alludes to origins and creation as he cuts between a garden featuring a bride and groom and an 1902 film entitled \"A Little Piece of String.\"", "poster_path": "/hrg5cK5zh4b0tVkEfPTEfDq4Ds2.jpg", "release_date": "1977-12-31", "title": "The Birth of Magellan: Cadenza I", "video": false, "vote_average": 3.7, "vote_count": 9, "popularity": 2.008}, {"id": 143551, "video": false, "vote_count": 12, "vote_average": 4.4, "title": "15/67: TV", "release_date": "1967-06-20", "original_language": "de", "original_title": "15/67: TV", "genre_ids": [18], "backdrop_path": null, "adult": false, "overview": "Kren frames the image to suggest a proscenium, with a view to the harbor that conveys a literal sense of \u201ctele-vision\u201d.
