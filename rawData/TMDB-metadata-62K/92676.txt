The camera zooms in into the boy's mind and a slow, sad waltz (i.e.\"Valse Triste\") accompanies images of a locomotive, a miner, the globe, the sky, a sheep heard, etc. Disparate elements, but if one concentrates only at the movement of the figures, one can perceive a commotion, slowly livening up: The starting wheels of the heavy locomotive, the tired miner pushing the heavy cart of coal bricks, the globe smoothly turning around and around, the clouds imperceptibly floating in the sky, the sheep idly moving in the herd, etc.  We reach the first climax when a mannequin opens her coat like a flower. The second big crescendo spurts out from a \"water hose\", after watching schoolgirls doing gymnastics for quite a while. A sad, but nostalgic aftertaste lingers in the end when funeral cars drive away through a flooded area\u2026", "poster_path": "/fsLJMk1dPfzr5qXd3IRSmZRxpX6.jpg", "release_date": "1977-06-01", "title": "Valse Triste", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 9, "popularity": 2.37}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/jvWFVFIAaDzBsGDFQHqtYEAOnxF.jpg", "genre_ids": [], "id": 147611, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Jamestown Baloos", "overview": "", "poster_path": "/cx89gzgyAdqNpYOoeU2YYRCkQfK.jpg", "release_date": "1957-12-31", "title": "Jamestown Baloos", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 8, "popularity": 1.096}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 212097, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Cotillion", "overview": "\"I have not changed the editing structure.
