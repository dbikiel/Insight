The film begins with Sugihara studying at a Korean junior high school that is dedicated to memory of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. His father is a grizzled ex-boxer who recently changed his citizenship from North to South Korea so he and his wife \u2013 Sugihara's mom \u2013 could visit Hawaii. Though his father regularly gets drunk and thrashes him, he also taught Sugihara the finer point of the sweet science. At one point in the film, Sugihara takes out an entire basketball team that was bent on taking him out. Upon graduation, Sugihara enters a normal Japanese high school where he meets and soon falls for Sakurai \u2013 a loose-sock copper-haired damsel who is attracted to Sugihara's restless spirit. As the film progresses, Sugihara struggles to throw off the stigma of his ethnicity and live a quiet, successful life.", "popularity": 3.49, "poster_path": "/5HFqQB33iuxWmgctrKKPL6oqoKR.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "JP", "name": "Japan"}], "release_date": "2001-10-20", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 122, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ja", "name": "\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e"}, {"iso_639_1": "ko", "name": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4/\uc870\uc120\ub9d0"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Go", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.1, "vote_count": 21, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 818, "name": "based on novel or book"}, {"id": 10683, "name": "coming of age"}, {"id": 12425, "name": "racism"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/kiWvoV78Cc3fUwkOHKzyBgVdrDD.jpg", "genre_ids": [37, 18, 12], "id": 281957, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Revenant", "overview": "In the 1820s, a frontiersman, Hugh Glass, sets out on a path of vengeance against those who left him for dead after a bear mauling.", "poster_path": "/oXUWEc5i3wYyFnL1Ycu8ppxxPvs.jpg", "release_date": "2015-12-25", "title": "The Revenant", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.5, "vote_count": 12122, "popularity": 30.491}, {"id": 407448, "video": false, "vote_count": 916, "vote_average": 7.3, "title": "Detroit", "release_date": "2017-07-28", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Detroit", "genre_ids": [80, 18, 36, 53], "backdrop_path": "/zpkWkIXEwSErbIgOlh1NkwQ6Pyj.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A police raid in Detroit in 1967 results in one of the largest citizens' uprisings in the history of the United States.", "poster_path": "/7APLVpsGzXPJw16ZuBtXICxq8B9.jpg", "popularity": 16.95}, {"id": 84892, "video": false, "vote_count": 6548, "vote_average": 7.7, "title": "The Perks of Being a Wallflower", "release_date": "2012-09-20", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Perks of Being a Wallflower", "genre_ids": [18], "backdrop_path": "/uhLcaTPeBpUNgYhZXhDWkj7gMkp.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "15-year-old freshman Charlie is a wallflower, always watching life from the sidelines, until two charismatic senior students become his mentors.
