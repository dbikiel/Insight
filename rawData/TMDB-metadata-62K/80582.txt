His travels take him from Alaska to Mexico with stops in San Diego, New York, Japan, Holland and Spain. In the end, he presents the testimonies of patients, scientists, surgeons and nutritionists who testify to the therapy s efficacy in curing cancer and other degenerative diseases, and presents the hard scientific proof to back up their claims. Testimonies include: a Japanese medical school professor who cured himself of liver cancer over 15 years ago, a lymphoma patient who was diagnosed as terminal over 50 years ago as well as from noted critics of this world-renowned healing method who dismiss it out of hand as pure quackery. So the question that remains is, Why is this powerful curative therapy still suppressed, more than 75 years after it was clearly proven to cure degenerative diseases?", "popularity": 0.991, "poster_path": "/eIrc96yUeo2q7RwCIoe8q5zo1d6.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2006-05-05", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 80, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "The evidence behind natural healing", "title": "Dying To Have Known", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 3, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 10163, "name": "cancer"}, {"id": 219954, "name": "gerson therapy"}, {"id": 219973, "name": "terapia gerson"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 258230, "video": false, "vote_count": 2101, "vote_average": 7.2, "title": "A Monster Calls", "release_date": "2016-10-07", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "A Monster Calls", "genre_ids": [18, 14], "backdrop_path": "/xVW8REyVqKwxAtUYY07UGlZH43L.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A boy imagines a monster that helps him deal with his difficult life and see the world in a different way.", "poster_path": "/oqZ0MBWxNrArZpyVqk3QGAA37QL.jpg", "popularity": 18.303}, {"id": 40807, "video": false, "vote_count": 2337, "vote_average": 7.1, "title": "50/50", "release_date": "2011-09-30", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "50/50", "genre_ids": [35, 18], "backdrop_path": "/kGac26bIqfwm8eqbP1RjKP70brE.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Inspired by a true story, a comedy centered on a 27-year-old guy who learns of his cancer diagnosis, and his subsequent struggle to beat the disease.", "poster_path": "/uDKmnFHqE3rQ9r6ErQsOZWuzXN8.jpg", "popularity": 13.937}, {"id": 238615, "video": false, "vote_count": 1985, "vote_average": 6.3, "title": "Self/less", "release_date": "2015-07-10", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Self/less", "genre_ids": [9648, 878, 53], "backdrop_path": "/xB92CSLn0w40ZoRGwfpkw9bbBMp.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "An extremely wealthy elderly man dying from cancer undergoes a radical medical procedure that transfers his consciousness to the body of a healthy young man but everything may not be as good as it seems when he starts to uncover the mystery of the body's origins and the secret organization that will kill to keep its secrets.", "poster_path": "/b03zZZTE17iH6klsInFOlrgfYRN.jpg", "popularity": 30.147}, {"id": 312221, "video": false, "vote_count": 4401, "vote_average": 7.4, "title": "Creed", "release_date": "2015-11-25", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Creed", "genre_ids": [18], "backdrop_path": "/fs2yhdSCzMVlNECrN84WuCkgXov.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "The former World Heavyweight Champion Rocky Balboa serves as a trainer and mentor to Adonis Johnson, the son of his late friend and former rival Apollo Creed.", "poster_path": "/hKzhV274pkZBSpXfCjUyzbyYKLl.jpg", "popularity": 17.844}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/9T8sj5io4SGCBTHsk5H8LGcfKVe.jpg", "genre_ids": [10749, 18], "id": 419478, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Midnight Sun", "overview": "Katie, a 17-year-old, has been sheltered since childhood and confined to her house during the day by a rare disease that makes even the smallest amount of sunlight deadly.
