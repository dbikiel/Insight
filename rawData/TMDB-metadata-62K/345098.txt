In 1815 Italy, a rich banker is killed under strange circumstances. The motive seems to be to get hold of some gold hidden inside a cuckoo clock. Vittorio De Sica heads the cast of this complex mystery, in which a huge, American-manufactured cuckoo clock is purchased by a European banker for the express purpose of smuggling gold into England. Set during the early 19th century, \"The Cuckoo Clock\" is lovely to look at but a bit thin dramatically. This Italian historical melodrama was acquired for US distribution by MGM-who promptly shelved the film for several months in reflection of mounting anti-Mussolini sentiments in the US.", "popularity": 1.241, "poster_path": "/A8fXqAlUDAZYtxB83fVzpoKYnVy.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 26092, "logo_path": null, "name": "ERA FILM", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "IT", "name": "Italy"}], "release_date": "1938-09-19", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "it", "name": "Italiano"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "Early prototype giallo.", "title": "The Cuckoo Clock", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "", "credit_id": "5ad738b30e0a2674d500e26f", "gender": 2, "id": 12329, "name": "Vittorio De Sica", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/spF2PL5J6ahWLCu8SyIGhwtLrkV.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "56e7f92cc3a36840940026cc", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 223708, "job": "Director", "name": "Camillo Mastrocinque", "profile_path": null}]}}
