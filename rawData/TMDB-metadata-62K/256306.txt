But missing paperwork, deceit and corruption have left them impoverished too. Finally, the father pawns his cow for a moped so that his son can earn a living as a taxi driver. His first customer is Sanmei, who has returned to Myanmar to bury her grandfather. She decides not to go back to China and to get out of an arranged marriage in order to begin a new life with her son in her old country. When Sanmei accepts a job as a drug runner she persuades the young farmer to be her driver.", "popularity": 1.217, "poster_path": "/m2iis0QSLnMG3GjF4zSawfbMhCB.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 97319, "logo_path": null, "name": "Seashore Image Productions", "origin_country": "TW"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "MM", "name": "Myanmar"}, {"iso_3166_1": "TW", "name": "Taiwan"}], "release_date": "2014-02-07", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 95, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "zh", "name": "\u666e\u901a\u8bdd"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Ice Poison", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.8, "vote_count": 4, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "", "credit_id": "53044c7f92514104cc0ad0fe", "gender": 0, "id": 1294366, "name": "Wang Shin-Hong", "order": 1, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "Sanmei", "credit_id": "53044c8992514104d00a0613", "gender": 1, "id": 1294367, "name": "Wu Ke-Xi", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/puILdtovnRWMVHmvVDZRQ82KQGt.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "53044c5b92514104cc0ad0ed", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 1033620, "job": "Director", "name": "Midi Z", "profile_path": "/fqzWs5kAjg7bn8MNbF4nvyBON7I.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "59e6ce0b9251416e8b003e5b", "department": "Production", "gender": 2, "id": 1033620, "job": "Producer", "name": "Midi Z", "profile_path": "/fqzWs5kAjg7bn8MNbF4nvyBON7I.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "59e6ce3d9251411cb90016b1", "department": "Writing", "gender": 2, "id": 1033620, "job": "Screenplay", "name": "Midi Z", "profile_path": "/fqzWs5kAjg7bn8MNbF4nvyBON7I.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "59e6ce6cc3a36851b1003bc7", "department": "Editing", "gender": 2, "id": 1033620, "job": "Editor", "name": "Midi Z", "profile_path": "/fqzWs5kAjg7bn8MNbF4nvyBON7I.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "59e6ce75c3a368133e0063cc", "department": "Editing", "gender": 0, "id": 1837216, "job": "Editor", "name": "Lin Sheng-Wen", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5ce758600e0a26426ace163f", "department": "Camera", "gender": 2, "id": 1923151, "job": "Director of Photography", "name": "Tom Fan Sheng-Siang", "profile_path": null}]}}
