Directed by Louis Mouchet, La Constellation Jodorowsky includes a lengthy on-camera interview with Jodorowsky in Spanish with subtitles. Marcel Marceau, Fernando Arrabal, Peter Gabriel, Jean \"Moebius\" Giraud, and Jean Pierre Vignau make appearances discussing their various projects with the director. In addition to the interview and film clips, Mouchet features some bizarre footage from Jodorowsky\u2019s absurdist plays in which topless women splattered with paint writhe around the stage in a theatrical production meant to represent The Panic Movement, i.e., an artistic expression in which reason cannot fully express the human experience.", "poster_path": "/tnhJK6rc864Ztt2ArSuShGmrmDH.jpg", "release_date": "1994-01-01", "title": "The Jodorowsky Constellation", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 9, "popularity": 2.781}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 7}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 2, "character": "Vad\u00f3c", "credit_id": "5a72d4f292514105a3006b25", "gender": 1, "id": 1090507, "name": "Andrea Drahota", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/yYO1leNE4qo4XF9Dj4XHSA18bdE.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "B\u00f6be", "credit_id": "5a72d4fb925141059a0069de", "gender": 1, "id": 586246, "name": "Marianna Mo\u00f3r", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/heqgE0uZCRGvnmaVTZWCCSeq3wz.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Anna n\u00e9ni", "credit_id": "5a72d5110e0a26642a00734e", "gender": 0, "id": 1970726, "name": "Istv\u00e1nn\u00e9 Zsipi", "order": 2, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Laci", "credit_id": "5a72d51f0e0a266427007385", "gender": 0, "id": 1970727, "name": "S\u00e1ndor Csik\u00f3s", "order": 3, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 7, "character": "Luja", "credit_id": "5a72d52fc3a36859cc0072f5", "gender": 2, "id": 146821, "name": "Andr\u00e1s Koz\u00e1k", "order": 4, "profile_path": "/sWu8SxVP6nwXnjs9YhhKqFxZ4gq.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 6, "character": "Gabi", "credit_id": "5a72d526925141059400693a", "gender": 0, "id": 1788393, "name": "J\u00e1nos Hark\u00e1nyi", "order": 5, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 8, "character": "", "credit_id": "5a72d5370e0a26643300716f", "gender": 0, "id": 1484860, "name": "Tibor Orb\u00e1n", "order": 6, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 9, "character": "Karesz", "credit_id": "5a72d540925141059a006a46", "gender": 0, "id": 1507344, "name": "Gyula Szers\u00e9n", "order": 7, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 10, "character": "Berci", "credit_id": "5a72d5750e0a2664270073c5", "gender": 0, "id": 1970728, "name": "Lajos T\u00f3th", "order": 8, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 11, "character": "Anya", "credit_id": "5a72d57ec3a36859ec007466", "gender": 0, "id": 1970729, "name": "M\u00e1ria Fogarasi", "order": 9, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 12, "character": "", "credit_id": "5a72d589c3a3685a1b006d4d", "gender": 0, "id": 1970730, "name": "Lajos Kormos", "order": 10, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 13, "character": "", "credit_id": "5a72d592c3a36859ec007479", "gender": 0, "id": 1970731, "name": "K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Csohany", "order": 11, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 14, "character": "", "credit_id": "5a72d59b0e0a26642d00752f", "gender": 0, "id": 1618592, "name": "Korn\u00e9lia Sallay", "order": 12, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 15, "character": "Luja apja", "credit_id": "5a72d5a8c3a3685a0c006fb9", "gender": 0, "id": 1402489, "name": "J\u00f3zsef Horv\u00e1th", "order": 13, "profile_path": "/hLjD97X0ZZGd4TkbzG0J5XQguLA.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "5382e741c3a3680598008212", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 1180566, "job": "Director", "name": "Istv\u00e1n Ga\u00e1l", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "5a72d4d80e0a266427007356", "department": "Writing", "gender": 2, "id": 1180566, "job": "Writer", "name": "Istv\u00e1n Ga\u00e1l", "profile_path": null}]}}
