It is somewhat humorous in the methods it uses to prove the secret life of plants, but thought-provoking in the conclusions it arrives at. The most wonderful thing about the film is the soundtrack. This is original music composed by Stevie Wonder. There is even a scene in the film of Stevie singing one of his songs in a boat on a river. This scene is very moving, as Stevie is blind and yet able to know where he is going. The scene is the climax to the movie, and metaphoric as to what has been presented about plants, that although they don't seem to have senses as human beings and animals do, they are quite well aware of what is going on around them and where they fit into this in the evolutionary process.", "popularity": 0.939, "poster_path": "/uj7EYLJuiuUs3KbovzZy27OrzVA.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 95368, "logo_path": null, "name": "Infinite Enterprises", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1979-12-09", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 95, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}, {"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "An incredible world of beauty and terror with a haunting music score by Stevie Wonder.", "title": "The Secret Life of Plants", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 3, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 2382, "name": "flower"}, {"id": 3704, "name": "plant"}, {"id": 6016, "name": "biology"}, {"id": 156810, "name": "science"}, {"id": 220339, "name": "botany"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/sQFka4QPJbxfdweX2TCD72QAAs0.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 39137, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Private Life of Plants", "overview": "David Attenborough takes us on a guided tour through the secret world of plants, to see things no unaided eye could witness.
