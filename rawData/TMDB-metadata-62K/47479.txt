Shea Stadium was closed (in part to create more parking space for a new stadium, Citi Field), and on July 16 and 18, 2008, Billy Joel headlined the final concerts held at the stadium. Filmmaker Paul Crowder and a camera crew were on hand for Joel's shows, and the documentary THE LAST PLAY AT SHEA chronicles his historic two-night stand, as well as exploring Joel's career, his ties to working-class New York, and how his life and career paralleled the growth of suburban Long Island and the beloved ballpark.", "popularity": 1.304, "poster_path": "/jXML1KnswYnSHTs7w4XNFc3GCPD.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2010-04-25", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Last Play at Shea", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.7, "vote_count": 3, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 3, "character": "", "credit_id": "52fe4735c3a36847f812920d", "gender": 2, "id": 7447, "name": "Alec Baldwin", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/zFtp13AZyPbqbj6yHujPWHO5ioh.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "", "credit_id": "52fe4735c3a36847f8129211", "gender": 2, "id": 138986, "name": "Tony Bennett", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/8mFowqqjo5XGHjiVUKZi6Sepbbh.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "", "credit_id": "52fe4735c3a36847f8129215", "gender": 2, "id": 92911, "name": "Garth Brooks", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/usNQqdaIZ6VMhtLhwiTHSW8ZiGQ.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 6, "character": "", "credit_id": "52fe4735c3a36847f8129219", "gender": 2, "id": 47096, "name": "Roger Daltrey", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/5hXMDGmnHLYrbSZp82CECz0m1I8.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4735c3a36847f8129203", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 4339, "job": "Director", "name": "Paul Crowder", "profile_path": "/lPCc7n7a4EtaFPYUJNJJn8Ius8D.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "52fe4735c3a36847f8129209", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 82259, "job": "Director", "name": "Jon Small", "profile_path": null}]}}
