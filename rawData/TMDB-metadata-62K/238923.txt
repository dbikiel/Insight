In a skirmish, Giovanni de'Medici is wounded in the leg by a falconet shot. The attempts to cure him fail and he dies. The Imperial armies assault Rome. The film is beautifully but unassumingly set, and shows the hard conditions in which war is waged and its lack of glory. It ends straightforwardly with the declaration made after the death of Giovanni de'Medici by the commanders of the armies in Europe of not using again fire weapons because of their cruelty.", "poster_path": "/eAuwDPXnIsblRmTLVl3mrGfi1ER.jpg", "release_date": "2001-05-11", "title": "The Profession of Arms", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 24, "popularity": 1.896}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/jg8FbnpbKdlPeopWa0xMPEFesA4.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 18], "id": 53482, "original_language": "it", "original_title": "L'uomo in pi\u00f9", "overview": "The debut feature by acclaimed Italian director Paolo Sorrentino (Il Divo) is a stylish and blackly comic look at the dark side of fame. Evocatively set during the eighties, the film charts the decline of two men both named Antonio Pisapia who lead entirely separate yet strangely parallel lives. One (Toni Servillo, Gomorrah) is a pop singer who finds himself washed up after a sex scandal ends his run of success; the other (Andrea Renzi) a football hero whose playing career is abruptly cut short by injury. Sharply observed and featuring excellent performances from the two leads, Sorrentino's compelling film explores the personal consequences wrought by cruel reversals of fortune.
