Mischievous Huckleberry Finn (Jeff East) is a 15-year-old boy who has long had a difficult relationship with his often violent father. When Dad tried to kidnap him, Huck decides to run away from home, and heads out of town on a raft. Huck is soon joined by Jim (Paul Winfield), a runaway slave who is no more eager to see his master than Huck is to see his father. As the two friends make their way down the Mississippi, they're faced with a variety of challenges and adventures, including a run-in with a pair of shabby but dignified actors, The King (Harvey Korman) and The Duke (David Wayne). Produced in association with Reader's Digest magazine, which in 1973, scored a box-office hit with a musical version of Twain's Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn featured original songs by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman, who also wrote the songs for a handful of Disney hits, including Mary Poppins.", "popularity": 2.453, "poster_path": "/8FMdSBWJcpdicnQrNBEiWpfL92p.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1974-05-24", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 118, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "The Greatest Of All American Adventure Stories.", "title": "Huckleberry Finn", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 5, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 818, "name": "based on novel or book"}, {"id": 4344, "name": "musical"}, {"id": 5900, "name": "missouri"}, {"id": 191412, "name": "huckleberry finn"}, {"id": 207928, "name": "19th century"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 630, "video": false, "vote_count": 3318, "vote_average": 7.5, "title": "The Wizard of Oz", "release_date": "1939-08-15", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Wizard of Oz", "genre_ids": [12, 14, 10751], "backdrop_path": "/pU2hNUkFAiq6HC8vUhnpRVcvH4G.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Young Dorothy finds herself in a magical world where she makes friends with a lion, a scarecrow and a tin man as they make their way along the yellow brick road to talk with the Wizard and ask for the things they miss most in their lives.
