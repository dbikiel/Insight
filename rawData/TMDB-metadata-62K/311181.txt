With his first book written as a way to heal after a broken relationship, Liam has slowly become disheartened with writing strictly for romantic fantasy, something evident to a sweet, but honest, journalist who reviews books, Sophie Atkinson (Amy Acker), whom he meets by chance on a plane. The two begin a tentative relationship in Sophie\u2019s home town of Portland, Oregon, where Liam has come to find inspiration for his newest entry.  Liam\u2019s agent puts him on the spot with a long-planned reveal of Gabriel August\u2019s true identity, but Sophie doesn\u2019t know of his public persona. The longer Liam avoids telling her the truth, the deeper a hole he digs for himself.
