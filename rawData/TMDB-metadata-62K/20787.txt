While hiking across the desert, they speculate that the planet is inhabited only by women. Murat does his \"wolf whistle\", which he uses on attractive women. However, he blows the wrong whistle and they are attacked by skeletons on horseback, which they defeat in hand-to-hand combat. The main villain soon shows up and captures the heroes, bringing them to his gladiatorial arena so they can fight. The villain tells them he is actually from Earth and is a 1,000 year old wizard. He tried to defeat Earth, but was always repelled by a shield of concentrated human brain molecules, which looks like the Death Star from Star Wars. The only way he can bypass this impenetrable defense is to use a human brain against it.", "popularity": 3.965, "poster_path": "/htLAdxXI46DLH1Bblovk0rg4MpQ.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 99390, "logo_path": "/otUAIvf2corEbM1SpFAx8DXFh6e.png", "name": "An\u0131t  Film", "origin_country": "TR"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "TR", "name": "Turkey"}], "release_date": "1982-11-04", "revenue": 29934, "runtime": 91, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "tr", "name": "T\u00fcrk\u00e7e"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Man Who Saves The World", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.2, "vote_count": 34, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 6158, "name": "cult"}, {"id": 161176, "name": "space opera"}, {"id": 224133, "name": "turksploitation"}, {"id": 260287, "name": "b film"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 1894, "video": false, "vote_count": 8115, "vote_average": 6.5, "title": "Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones", "release_date": "2002-05-15", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones", "genre_ids": [28, 12, 878], "backdrop_path": "/vovhXw10DSsRS9yoVbZqb60pXyX.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Following an assassination attempt on Senator Padm\u00e9 Amidala, Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi investigate a mysterious plot that could change the galaxy forever.", "poster_path": "/2vcNFtrZXNwIcBgH5e2xXCmVR8t.jpg", "popularity": 32.579}, {"id": 1895, "video": false, "vote_count": 8391, "vote_average": 7.3, "title": "Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith", "release_date": "2005-05-17", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith", "genre_ids": [28, 12, 878], "backdrop_path": "/wUYTfFbfPiZC6Lcyt1nonr69ZmK.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "The evil Darth Sidious enacts his final plan for unlimited power -- and the heroic Jedi Anakin Skywalker must choose a side.", "poster_path": "/tgr5Pdy7ehZYBqBkN2K7Q02xgOb.jpg", "popularity": 28.549}, {"id": 1893, "video": false, "vote_count": 8958, "vote_average": 6.4, "title": "Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace", "release_date": "1999-05-19", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace", "genre_ids": [28, 12, 878], "backdrop_path": "/oFmzoKDMedABPpRBDVwr0aynSK1.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Anakin Skywalker, a young slave strong with the Force, is discovered on Tatooine.
