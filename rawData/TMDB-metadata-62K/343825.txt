The film starts on 1 January 1992, at 6 am and ends in a misty landscape at the end of that year.

Modern agriculture is ruled by new regulations, largely made in Brussels. Lonely work on a noisy machine replaces hard but communal work on the land. In a disciplined style, the film shows the disappearance of a traditional lifestyle in part of Holland.
