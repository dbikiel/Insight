Inside their bus, hidden behind a false compartment, they have discovered 700 pounds of hashish. Although the owner of the bus company is arrested as well and makes a full confession clearly indicating that both drivers were unaware of the hidden drugs, the Moroccan judge sentences both men to 5 years in the Moroccan prison of Tangiers. Nothing could have prepared the two men for life inside a Moroccan prison. Without food, clothes or medical care, they must learn how to take care of themselves to survive their stay in prison. Corrupt guards, corrupt lawyers and judges, a consul who doesn't care and frequent beatings are only part of the terrible prison. Meanwhile their families at home are left without any information, any help or any hope - finding out that their own government doesn't care for Belgian people in prisons abroad.", "popularity": 1.517, "poster_path": "/wg2FGA8jOqubGa5asM9lE3eQ4MQ.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 4035, "logo_path": null, "name": "Skyline Film & Television", "origin_country": "BE"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "BE", "name": "Belgium"}], "release_date": "2006-03-15", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 105, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ar", "name": "\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629"}, {"iso_639_1": "nl", "name": "Nederlands"}, {"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "Hell in Tangier", "title": "Tangier", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 7, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/xXkiIVsOsuzZHhExivDY0zh1wM1.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 18], "id": 66066, "original_language": "nl", "original_title": "Verlengd Weekend", "overview": "Businessman Christian Vandenheuvel planned to spend the long weekend with his young mistress, Lisa.
