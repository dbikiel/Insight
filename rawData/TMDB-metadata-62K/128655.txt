Although originating before the show, they appeared in a number of brief sketches in the 1980s TV programme Saturday Live. Eventually being banned for being \"too sexy and too violent\", they staged a protest by returning as 'The Ben Elton Brothers', and blowing up the car park at LWT Studios. One of the final sketches prepared for Saturday Live was entitled 'Kinky Sex'. This fell foul of Channel 4 censors who banned it. The duo responded in the sketch Dangervision by apparently hijacking the programme and blowing up the wall on which the show's logo was painted in graffiti art. The banned sketch, which by modern standards seems fairly tame, was finally released on a compilation video The Dangerous Brothers present: World of Danger.", "poster_path": "/1cAa7rJpjh4jLHMRDIR5eKhbhHf.jpg", "release_date": "1986-01-01", "title": "Dangerous Brothers Present: World of Danger", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.2, "vote_count": 6, "popularity": 1.709}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/5VdSkbGpUjYgEcTXJdcHAss8DSr.jpg", "genre_ids": [], "id": 246096, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "7E", "overview": "A young man struggles with unexplained events inside a New York apartment where tenants are not who they appear to be.", "poster_path": "/9GuBcSb1xx5R9QCztDzj1OyohyL.jpg", "release_date": "2013-12-10", "title": "7E", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.2, "vote_count": 6, "popularity": 1.673}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/3CKHleOFwGekwQS1PktkTfkMQmP.jpg", "genre_ids": [53, 878], "id": 260107, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Everywhen", "overview": "A boy must fight his way from an alternate reality, back to his own, to save his suicidal 5-year old brother; when 3 billion people are reported missing.", "poster_path": "/vhSIroWL0RiCHvpyfI5GmMe8n5F.jpg", "release_date": "2013-01-28", "title": "Everywhen", "video": false, "vote_average": 3.1, "vote_count": 10, "popularity": 2.344}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [27], "id": 52631, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Open Door", "overview": "A pirate radio station is granting callers their hearts' desires.
