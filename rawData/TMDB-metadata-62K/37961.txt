This routine changes one day when he is paid a visit by a man in a trench-coat. Once the two get talking, it seems that the visitor (Calling himself Endou) is a debt collector. The reason for his visit is an unpaid loan which kaiji had previously co-signed for a work-mate (Furuhata Takeshi). The original loan was 30000 yen and once Takeshi had disappeared, the loan then fell on Kaiji. Kaiji is then told of a way to clear the interest compounded debt (which stood at 3,850,000 yen), which involved getting on a boat with others in his position. Once on the boat the debtors would then have to gamble with loaned money, which would end with a few winning, and others getting into deeper debt and having to work to pay of their debts. After some coercing kaiji accepts a position on the boat, in order to clear himself and make a bit of money as well...", "popularity": 5.558, "poster_path": "/asSv3KgLO5Yp4HE8XsXkFIqwIOK.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 882, "logo_path": "/fRSWWjquvzcHjACbtF53utZFIll.png", "name": "Toho Company, Ltd.", "origin_country": "JP"}, {"id": 20192, "logo_path": null, "name": "Nippon Television Network (NTV)", "origin_country": "JP"}, {"id": 4330, "logo_path": null, "name": "Horipro", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "JP", "name": "Japan"}], "release_date": "2009-10-10", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 130, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "ja", "name": "\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Kaiji: The Ultimate Gambler", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 12, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/j8tKpxCkx50lw2ovvd6vVWfOW1O.jpg", "genre_ids": [53, 18], "id": 106417, "original_language": "ja", "original_title": "\u30ab\u30a4\u30b82 \u4eba\u751f\u596a\u56de\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0", "overview": "3 years after the ultimate life-or-death game with Teiai Group, Kaiji was entrapped by Teiai and again back in the underground, forced to do hard labour.
