A trio of lecherous bandits try to force themselves on the nun, and Madron shoots two of them to death. The third is made to swear allegiance to Sister Mary in exchange for his life. The Apaches trap the trio and Madron comforts the crying nun, who emerges the next morning sans her religious habit. This is supposedly the first movie filmed in Israel without an Israeli theme. Smoke signals are obviously added in the post-production process, drawing unintentional laughter for this violent and forgettable film.", "poster_path": "/8lzcCLlegXrHQLgdUA7TzfrZv8n.jpg", "release_date": "1970-12-01", "title": "Madron", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.4, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 2.062}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/vycOmwdBDZlvlEaWz42pfNp6DI6.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 53], "id": 29116, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Velvet Touch", "overview": "After accidentally killing her lecherous producer, a famous actress tries to hide her guilt.", "poster_path": "/nkNnZ1KlGCp19PIkJ0ul1Zc8lxQ.jpg", "release_date": "1948-07-13", "title": "The Velvet Touch", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 11, "popularity": 4.62}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [18, 80], "id": 261419, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "No Trees in the Street", "overview": "Based on the play by Ted Willis, the film is set in the years just before World War II, when England hadn't completely dug itself out of the worldwide depression.
