While doing research for the film, we had intimate and candid conversations with kids in middle school classrooms, suburban shopping malls, nightclubs, college dorms, and even conducted an informal roundtable during a high school house party. While chronicling trends among small town and big city kids, we discovered this: Having pubic hair is considered unattractive and \u201cgross.\u201d Most youngsters know someone who has emailed or texted a naked photo of themselves. Many kids have accidentally or intentionally had their first introduction to sex be via hardcore online porn.

He's even got his war pony, Protector: a beat-up old wreck of a car. Buddy's sister has been arrested in Santa Fe, and together Buddy and Philbert set off on a road trip to look after her kids and go bail her out. However, Bonnie's arrest has something strange about it as her friend Rabbit points out. As the miles roll by, Philbert's faith challenges Buddy's hard-edged view of the world (and occasional bout of reckless violence), and together they face the realities and dreams of being Cheyenne in the modern-day US as they fight to free Bonnie and her children and elude the Feds.", "poster_path": "/ivjvzL2VxATTIKpvJSZmcwqN8rn.jpg", "release_date": "1989-02-24", "title": "Powwow Highway", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.1, "vote_count": 9, "popularity": 3.816}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 2}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 3, "character": "Tommy Wilhelm", "credit_id": "52fe4a849251416c750e4ab9", "gender": 2, "id": 2157, "name": "Robin Williams", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/5KebSMXT8uj2D0gkaMFJ8VEp53.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Rojax", "credit_id": "52fe4a849251416c750e4abd", "gender": 2, "id": 27515, "name": "Richard B.
