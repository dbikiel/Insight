The homeowner attacks, but the gophers outsmart him at every turn: They duck his hoe and shotgun. He gasses them with helium, and they float away -- causing a crow to throw away his bottle. The inflated gophers hit a tree and fall to earth. The gardener fishes for the gophers under his hat; they substitute a tomato, and he cries, thinking he's squished a gopher. Next, he tries the garden hose; the gophers stop the flow until there's a huge blast of water, which they direct back at the homeowner. He hits the ground and starts burrowing himself, surfacing in his fountain.", "popularity": 0.6, "poster_path": "/kbwPAlb34tUoIquBsmqpglP3X60.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1942-06-26", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 7, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Gopher Goofy", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 2, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4e5dc3a36847f828c423", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 173626, "job": "Director", "name": "Norm McCabe", "profile_path": "/fiXZHKpQmLD5SKjl31EtdMAWsLg.jpg"}]}}
