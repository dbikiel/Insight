He learns about 'being hot' and 'fucking' and about what you have to do when you're alone and 'feel the itch'. He also learns that there are handsome men and ugly ones, that love can be unfair. That one can find comfort in drinking... but above all he learns that man is capable of anything - absolutely anything! - to get his fair share of love.", "popularity": 2.083, "poster_path": "/fFbMigzesJSvNP9B6pXLcHDV1SW.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 11796, "logo_path": "/tx6LOQcTSqgW8ffKxovuJHjlYVw.png", "name": "Centre du Cin\u00e9ma et de l'Audiovisuel de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Wallonie-Bruxelles", "origin_country": "BE"}, {"id": 110350, "logo_path": null, "name": "Kabinet van de Gemeenschapsminister van Cultuur", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 110351, "logo_path": null, "name": "Multimedia (BE)", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "BE", "name": "Belgium"}], "release_date": "1987-10-01", "revenue": 119919, "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}, {"iso_639_1": "nl", "name": "Nederlands"}, {"iso_639_1": "it", "name": "Italiano"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Crazy Love", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.4, "vote_count": 8, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [35, 16], "id": 162736, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Ups 'n Downs", "overview": "Bosko runs a hot dog stand at an amusement park; but he sneaks away to the racetrack to ride his mechanical horse.", "poster_path": "/v5k3lnZllJicuiQWtQB3kPEZGsd.jpg", "release_date": "1931-03-02", "title": "Ups 'n Downs", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.3, "vote_count": 4, "popularity": 1.4}, {"id": 152464, "video": false, "vote_count": 8, "vote_average": 4.9, "title": "The Wicked Darling", "release_date": "1919-12-25", "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "The Wicked Darling", "genre_ids": [80, 18], "backdrop_path": "/cbwlNeTEt7vKVhJXWGz6gdLkzYm.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A slum girl is forced to steal for a living.
