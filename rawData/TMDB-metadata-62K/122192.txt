The story follows Patsy, a lonely, dreamy nurse who, after being bitten by a zombie, becomes a sex-kitten. With her newfound powers, she tries to win back her old flame, the suave and handsome Dr. Dox, from Goodie , a bitchy young nurse. As the film progresses, Patsy must also learn to deal with her new affliction and to live her life, no longer in her romantic dream world, but in a harsher yet ultimately more satisfying reality.  Shot in Techniscope with a 1:2.35 aspect ratio, an old process used in many 1960's films such as Dario Argento's \"The Cat O' Nine Tails\", GRAVEYARD ALIVE promises to invigorate the horror genre stylistically as well as with its audacious and thought-provoking content.", "poster_path": "/xuF0B6MulvTprDGEp9M0jnNFr4s.jpg", "release_date": "2003-01-01", "title": "Graveyard Alive- A Zombie Nurse in Love", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.6, "vote_count": 7, "popularity": 3.725}, {"id": 90966, "video": false, "vote_count": 9, "vote_average": 6.8, "title": "Magic Town", "release_date": "1947-10-07", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Magic Town", "genre_ids": [35, 10749], "backdrop_path": "/kZ18VKdD1q1NtikeIdR3Fps4ae2.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Rip Smith's opinion-poll business is a failure...until he discovers that the small town of Grandview is statistically identical to the entire country.
