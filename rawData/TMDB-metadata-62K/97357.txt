However, he got caught in the middle of the Reagan/Bush administration efforts to topple the Nicaraguan government in the '80s, in which Nicaraguan rebels called \"contras\" were allowed to smuggle cocaine into the US in exchange for their fighting against the leftist Nicaraguan government. Eventually Seal was murdered by his former Medellin employers, and some critics say it was with the tacit, if not implicit, connivance of the US administration.", "popularity": 1.789, "poster_path": "/jhM62cE30W7DjpqawEyzHHtIOXe.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1991-07-20", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 109, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Doublecrossed", "video": false, "vote_average": 3.8, "vote_count": 2, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 2150, "name": "cocaine"}, {"id": 6342, "name": "nicaragua"}, {"id": 10391, "name": "mafia"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 319, "video": false, "vote_count": 1440, "vote_average": 7.5, "title": "True Romance", "release_date": "1993-09-09", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "True Romance", "genre_ids": [28, 80, 53, 10749], "backdrop_path": "/f0qqTEyVmmztypEMV3THRdnBjFj.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Clarence marries hooker Alabama, steals cocaine from her pimp, and tries to sell it in Hollywood, while the owners of the coke try to reclaim it.", "poster_path": "/xBO8R3CZfrJ9rrwrZoJ68PgJyAR.jpg", "popularity": 21.384}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/v761yOHKO3p6Yr7LDCjud6tUL5G.jpg", "genre_ids": [28, 80, 53], "id": 10651, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Dead Pool", "overview": "Dirty Harry Callahan returns for his final film adventure.
