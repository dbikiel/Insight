Legendary bank robber Vergara Grey is getting out of prison after 5 long years and is looking forward to a quiet, uneventful life together with his wife and son whom oddly he hasn't heard from in years. But soon his resolve is tested when he meets 19 year old Angel a young thief who insists the two join up to score the biggest heist of all time. Though tempted, he resists until he finds out that his beloved wife has gone off with a millionaire and his son wants to change his last name. Then Victoria, a graceful and mysteriously mute dancer living in a conservatory, steps into the picture. She captivates Vergara and Angel, as well as all others that cross her path, drastically changing their lives.", "poster_path": "/vlPNrTEsaIGnzBpfRM2YLQ7SJzo.jpg", "release_date": "2009-11-27", "title": "The Dancer and the Thief", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.7, "vote_count": 15, "popularity": 2.737}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/xj4swDWHuwOkz6XF1GS24m6Ue45.jpg", "genre_ids": [10749, 35], "id": 484880, "original_language": "es", "original_title": "La playa del amor", "overview": "To forget his girlfriend a young man is taken to a beach by his brother and a friend.", "poster_path": "/wbSH96VeIy3KA3uVjKwIJcfdwa9.jpg", "release_date": "1980-02-21", "title": "The Beach of Love", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.3, "vote_count": 3, "popularity": 2.542}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/qGIvKwZujiwEoKvXVD3HQuIkIAv.jpg", "genre_ids": [9648, 80, 18], "id": 127702, "original_language": "es", "original_title": "La se\u00f1al", "overview": "During the last days of Eva Peron, a pair of low-ranking detectives are thrust into a case of corruption involving the Mafia.", "poster_path": "/oyq6xF7N1kNLFvUpwnfVFRVpzDI.jpg", "release_date": "2007-09-13", "title": "La se\u00f1al", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.3, "vote_count": 8, "popularity": 1.712}, {"id": 475817, "video": false, "vote_count": 3, "vote_average": 7.3, "title": "La Discoteca del Amor", "release_date": "1980-08-07", "original_language": "es", "original_title": "La Discoteca del Amor", "genre_ids": [28, 10402], "backdrop_path": null, "adult": false, "overview": "Music execs find out their songs are being pirated, so a detective and his assistant are hired to catch the culprits.", "poster_path": "/r6E7UkDyJDRhONOTxp2T3COAUwV.jpg", "popularity": 1.8}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/ebroF6n84VNCZXDNaK9jb2Bv50q.jpg", "genre_ids": [35], "id": 127289, "original_language": "es", "original_title": "Cohen vs. Rosi", "overview": "Two rival families of different origin join the force by the love of two young.
