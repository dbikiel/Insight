The final symbolic images of Spring, achieved through time-lapse photography, are almost unbearably beautiful. The winner of several festival awards, Farrebique nonetheless did not immediately result in an outpouring of financing for Rouqier's follow-up films (this was a common problem in the financially strapped French film industry of the 1940s). Perhaps as a result, Rouqier did not make his sequel, Biquefarre (filmed in the same region, with some of the same \"actors\"), until 1983.", "poster_path": "/rx81Dh44AxQnTtDJqrlFPptvJk5.jpg", "release_date": "1946-09-01", "title": "Farrebique, or the Four Seasons", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 1.586}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/hbD4lkt09o1bz1hOss2C6pDE5z6.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 14, 10749], "id": 101564, "original_language": "es", "original_title": "La virgen de la lujuria", "overview": "In Vera Cruz in the 1940s, Nacho, an Indian, waits tables at Don L\u00e1zaro's caf\u00e9 at Hotel Of\u00e9lia.
