With his first book written as a way to heal after a broken relationship, Liam has slowly become disheartened with writing strictly for romantic fantasy, something evident to a sweet, but honest, journalist who reviews books, Sophie Atkinson (Amy Acker), whom he meets by chance on a plane. The two begin a tentative relationship in Sophie\u2019s home town of Portland, Oregon, where Liam has come to find inspiration for his newest entry.  Liam\u2019s agent puts him on the spot with a long-planned reveal of Gabriel August\u2019s true identity, but Sophie doesn\u2019t know of his public persona. The longer Liam avoids telling her the truth, the deeper a hole he digs for himself. Will their romance survive once his true identity comes to light?", "poster_path": "/cLgHUoemiSv3TqoCOnb8oiYdRVX.jpg", "popularity": 4.91}, {"id": 299578, "video": false, "vote_count": 41, "vote_average": 5.9, "title": "A Cookie Cutter Christmas", "release_date": "2014-11-09", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "A Cookie Cutter Christmas", "genre_ids": [35, 10770], "backdrop_path": "/wTBKlMdvl49u7PKcd6vR9fdzf35.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Two longtime rivals and elementary school teachers duke it out during the holidays in a Christmas cookie bake-off, but their real feud ignites over a shared interest in a handsome single dad.
