The main actor Mikko Leppilampi says it's about \"kolkyttoistavuotiaat\" (= thirtyeenagers = people of thirty behaving like teenagers). An immediate reference point is the commedia all'italiana of the 1950s and the 1960s, the black comedy often exposing the infantile stage of development of the Italian male. Saku and \u00c4ss\u00e4 are anti-heroes, but we never fail to sense the humanity behind their shallow and crazy ways. Veijarit is a satire and a parody of a superficial way of life, but there is a vitality in the protagonists that we feel can lead them to a more meaningful stage of existence after the prolonged youth full of sound and fury. There is a motif of transcendence in the imagery of flying: will the balloons carry me or will they burst.", "popularity": 1.894, "poster_path": "/rMx2NghgjrthMqcPp9VRca4PMWv.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FI", "name": "Finland"}], "release_date": "2010-12-25", "revenue": 0, "runtime": null, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fi", "name": "suomi"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Veijarit", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 6, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 207268, "name": "neo-noir"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/7RRuRcGuWkZGuRyYugfXn0Fgrrr.jpg", "genre_ids": [28, 80, 18, 53], "id": 949, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Heat", "overview": "Obsessive master thief, Neil McCauley leads a top-notch crew on various daring heists throughout Los Angeles while determined detective, Vincent Hanna pursues him without rest.
