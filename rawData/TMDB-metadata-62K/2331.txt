Satan is portrayed as a man in modern dress (and as a woman in red). During his temptation of Jesus, he shows him the Earth from the vantage point of space. Satan also shows Jesus images of wars and destruction carried out in his name. The film adds an apocryphal Roman historian named \u201cLivio\u201d who watches and comments as events unfold; he is presumably named after Livy.", "popularity": 5.909, "poster_path": "/jkyll5jAzT6UT8gFp40e0iWzdYA.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 974, "logo_path": null, "name": "Five Mile River Films", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 1080, "logo_path": null, "name": "Beta Film", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 1081, "logo_path": "/vfcpaPf6WktaCIHqF4FJAcek8q2.png", "name": "CBS Television Studios", "origin_country": "US"}, {"id": 1082, "logo_path": null, "name": "Lux Vide", "origin_country": "IT"}, {"id": 487, "logo_path": "/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png", "name": "\u010cesk\u00e1 televize", "origin_country": "CZ"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CZ", "name": "Czech Republic"}, {"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}, {"iso_3166_1": "IT", "name": "Italy"}, {"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1999-12-25", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 240, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "it", "name": "Italiano"}, {"iso_639_1": "pt", "name": "Portugu\u00eas"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Jesus", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.9, "vote_count": 16, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 186, "name": "christianity"}, {"id": 2292, "name": "communion"}, {"id": 2606, "name": "jew / jewish"}, {"id": 3034, "name": "last supper"}, {"id": 3036, "name": "bible"}, {"id": 3902, "name": "synagogue"}, {"id": 6506, "name": "resurrection"}, {"id": 11001, "name": "religion"}, {"id": 11704, "name": "judaism"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/eWelH0cHonTsdP6ImrgilpbqdTK.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 36], "id": 335778, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Risen", "overview": "Clavius, a powerful Roman military tribune, and his aide, Lucius, are tasked with solving the mystery of what happened to Jesus in the weeks following the crucifixion, in order to disprove the rumors of a risen Messiah and prevent an uprising in Jerusalem.", "poster_path": "/uGZ1easTLqkNfDNHRLm5kvkfRw7.jpg", "release_date": "2016-02-18", "title": "Risen", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.9, "vote_count": 452, "popularity": 13.954}, {"id": 235260, "video": false, "vote_count": 137, "vote_average": 6.4, "title": "Son of God", "release_date": "2014-02-28", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Son of God", "genre_ids": [18], "backdrop_path": "/fabLQCBndX9Zfd3mX0RS1OjyqEX.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "The life story of Jesus is told from his humble birth through his teachings, crucifixion and ultimate resurrection.", "poster_path": "/xyFaNh1IGdHEJbuLdba6a7GxLzP.jpg", "popularity": 11.437}, {"id": 615, "video": false, "vote_count": 1934, "vote_average": 7.1, "title": "The Passion of the Christ", "release_date": "2004-02-25", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Passion of the Christ", "genre_ids": [18], "backdrop_path": "/clVnEHURb8Ot3twaLmf7N1lNym1.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A graphic portrayal of the last twelve hours of Jesus of Nazareth's life.", "poster_path": "/oFuLM1EaKhi1WNWiTjQ1HKIZ1Eg.jpg", "popularity": 21.645}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/sO6AnUEirDnaxjy8dxaqYEKDxGi.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 36], "id": 6844, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Ten Commandments", "overview": "Escaping death, a Hebrew infant is raised in a royal household to become a prince.
