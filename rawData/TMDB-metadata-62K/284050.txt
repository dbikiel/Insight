A mouse who had been monitoring the situation tells another mouse, who in turn tells another mouse until finally the news reaches P\u00e9rez, The Hairy Tooth Fairy, who lives in a boat in the port along with hundreds of other mice. They receive the teeth that he collects, and then clean, shape and polish them so that they can be transformed into shiny round pearls. These pearls are then carried through the citys sewers until finally they reach the jewellers owned by Morientes, where an old friend exchanges them for their weight in gold.", "poster_path": "/ryrAsZx8gZPQkxmmmyz9sRiBkr7.jpg", "popularity": 4.627}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 12}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 0, "character": "Jacobo Kaplan", "credit_id": "53d5f3a3c3a3686b8b0057dc", "gender": 2, "id": 261853, "name": "H\u00e9ctor Noguera", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/6BKrshd6lfFtpzm1heZXEkMZMZ1.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 1, "character": "Wilson Contreras", "credit_id": "53d5f3acc3a3686b880054bc", "gender": 2, "id": 548835, "name": "N\u00e9stor Guzzini", "order": 2, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "Julius Reich, The German", "credit_id": "53d5f3b6c3a3686b91005769", "gender": 2, "id": 16243, "name": "Rolf Becker", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/eik3TSY86XzPgpCFBEQPNjNwRmS.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "Rebeca Kaplan", "credit_id": "53d5f3c0c3a3686b970055de", "gender": 1, "id": 1346877, "name": "Nidia Telles", "order": 4, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Lottie", "credit_id": "53d5f3cfc3a3686b8e005044", "gender": 1, "id": 1346878, "name": "Nuria Fl\u00f3", "order": 5, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 8, "character": "Estrella", "credit_id": "5898cf0d9251417a8500c32f", "gender": 1, "id": 548833, "name": "Leonor Svarcas", "order": 6, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 9, "character": "Isaac Kaplan", "credit_id": "5898cf169251417a8200c690", "gender": 2, "id": 1752281, "name": "Gustavo Saffores", "order": 7, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 10, "character": "Elias", "credit_id": "5898cf1d9251417a8200c696", "gender": 2, "id": 1513708, "name": "Hugo Piccinini", "order": 8, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 11, "character": "Carlos", "credit_id": "5898cf25c3a368770e00cda4", "gender": 2, "id": 1752282, "name": "Cesar Jourdan", "order": 9, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 12, "character": "Kilgman", "credit_id": "5898cf2dc3a368770900c3bc", "gender": 2, "id": 116588, "name": "Jorge Bolani", "order": 10, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 13, "character": "Weinstein", "credit_id": "5898cf36c3a368771500cc38", "gender": 2, "id": 1752283, "name": "Augusto Mazzarelli", "order": 11, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 14, "character": "Sheila", "credit_id": "5898cf3d9251417a7c00ca97", "gender": 1, "id": 1752284, "name": "Adela Dubr\u00e1", "order": 12, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 15, "character": "Ernesto", "credit_id": "5898cf45c3a368771d00cf51", "gender": 2, "id": 1153979, "name": "Roberto Su\u00e1rez", "order": 13, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 16, "character": "Mimi Weinstein", "credit_id": "5898cf4c9251417a8e00d401", "gender": 1, "id": 1752285, "name": "Anouk Ogueta", "order": 14, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 17, "character": "Lejman", "credit_id": "5898cf549251417a9100cda8", "gender": 2, "id": 1752286, "name": "Gabriel Kaplan", "order": 15, "profile_path": null}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "53d5f44bc3a3686b91005775", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 233912, "job": "Director", "name": "\u00c1lvaro Brechner", "profile_path": "/7JcxCVlWRh9OLEnEhmPDq6vVtI4.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "5898cef6c3a368772400be91", "department": "Production", "gender": 2, "id": 233912, "job": "Producer", "name": "\u00c1lvaro Brechner", "profile_path": "/7JcxCVlWRh9OLEnEhmPDq6vVtI4.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "5898cee8c3a368771200bc35", "department": "Writing", "gender": 2, "id": 233912, "job": "Writer", "name": "\u00c1lvaro Brechner", "profile_path": "/7JcxCVlWRh9OLEnEhmPDq6vVtI4.jpg"}]}}
