Jeannie is unaware through all of this (even when the baby crawls over her), and at one point even chases Tom away for \"bothering the baby\" when he returns the baby to the crib.", "poster_path": "/imKJzUydO7dbuSCyiTxxbtXFzWW.jpg", "release_date": "1956-05-04", "title": "Busy Buddies", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 14, "popularity": 1.953}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [16, 35, 10751], "id": 235813, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Wild Over You", "overview": "A wildcat escapes from the zoo, disguises herself as a skunk to fool her pursuers, but that only attracts love-struck Pepe, who finds he enjoys the extra spice that fangs and claws add to lovemaking.", "poster_path": "/dwXg7dIL9PomwbuEirSqGnHIlnX.jpg", "release_date": "1953-07-10", "title": "Wild Over You", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.4, "vote_count": 11, "popularity": 1.943}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [16], "id": 146747, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Carrotblanca", "overview": "A re-telling of \"Casablanca\" starring Bugs Bunny and the Looney Tunes cast.", "poster_path": "/60CkmIQfNzJgCbfHCMLY00N6Fgk.jpg", "release_date": "1995-08-25", "title": "Carrotblanca", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 21, "popularity": 1.83}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/wQ4kCKeEJH1169YgV5FtdjDvAiJ.jpg", "genre_ids": [35, 16], "id": 83203, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Trail Mix-Up", "overview": "During a picnic, Baby Herman follows a beaver into a perilous sawmill - with Roger Rabbit in frantic pursuit.", "poster_path": "/OMfR12Uc8SS8v2bGvDflKoi6Te.jpg", "release_date": "1993-03-12", "title": "Trail Mix-Up", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.7, "vote_count": 27, "popularity": 3.585}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/d0ABcGZiqgKp55GDKQ097Nm3H70.jpg", "genre_ids": [16, 10751, 35], "id": 100348, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Show Biz Bugs", "overview": "Bugs and Daffy are vaudevillians competing for praise from the audience.
