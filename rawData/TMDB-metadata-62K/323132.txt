This event was possibly the last performance of the Agnicayana, a Vedic ritual of sacrifice dating back 3,000 years and probably the oldest surviving human ritual. Long considered extinct and never witnessed by outsiders, the ceremonies require the participation of seventeen priests, involve libations of Soma juice and oblations of other substances, all preceded by several months of preparation and rehearsals. They include the construction, from a thousand bricks, of a fire altar in the shape of a bird.", "popularity": 0.6, "poster_path": "/iJ78kYBNFIJ1HhZ2DoDf3MyN0ca.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "IN", "name": "India"}, {"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1976-01-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 45, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Altar of Fire", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "5704ab009251417dab000c1f", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 1601664, "job": "Director", "name": "Robert Gardner", "profile_path": "/9lLPZMt05AivHCrPo0nPqvvLDg2.jpg"}]}}
