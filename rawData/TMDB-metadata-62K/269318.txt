She plays a British nurse named Lily, one of several survivors of a submarine attack during WW2. Lily and the others are rescued by Renato Baldini, commander of the Italian submarine which sank their ship. At first, there's no love lost between the Italian crew and their Allied captives. Gradually, Baldini's essential humanity is revealed, as is his love for the now-friendly Lily. What starts as a traditional wartime melodrama concludes in the spirit of peace on earth, goodwill towards men.  The director won two awards at the 1954 Berlin International Film Festival for the film.", "popularity": 2.114, "poster_path": "/wEEgireXqXQN85EtZ27OGXCbVyC.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "IT", "name": "Italy"}], "release_date": "1955-06-03", "revenue": 0, "runtime": null, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "it", "name": "Italiano"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "There's DRAMA - There's DANGER - There's DEATH", "title": "Submarine Attack", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.3, "vote_count": 3, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/y7YPUgqBVQrrtKfAAk5oUjNe6FR.jpg", "genre_ids": [28, 12, 18], "id": 41818, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Tides of War", "overview": "In the cold, dark waters off North Korea a U.S. Navy fast attack submarine meets with a mysterious disaster - it's attacked and nearly sunk by an ominous stealth submarine resulting in the deaths of the Executive Officer and the Engineering Officer.", "poster_path": "/O9porsVbq2USGysWWRtq22s52M.jpg", "release_date": "2005-04-01", "title": "Tides of War", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 3, "popularity": 3.697}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/zKsHlqC0lSaXCML1JWDbxEfrK9Y.jpg", "genre_ids": [36, 10752], "id": 146563, "original_language": "it", "original_title": "Sotto dieci bandiere", "overview": "\"Under Ten Flags\" is a WWII movie loosely  based on the true story of the German navy commerce raider Atlantis, a converted Auxilliary Cruiser, and her Captain Bernhard Rogge.

Rogge was one of the few German officers of flag rank who were not arrested by the Allies after the war ended. This was due to the very proper and ethical way he exercised his command of Atlantis.
