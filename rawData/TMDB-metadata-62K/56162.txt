He ran away from home when he realized that his step-mother hated him from day-one. Among Jojo's many neighbors is the gorgeous Jenny Dorr , a nightclub dancer, whose lover he dreams of being. But, to Jojo's disappointment, Jenny becomes the lover of Dicky, a former boxer, who spends his time loafing about the Pigalle caf\u00e9s. Jojo lacks for steady work, but manages to meet his financial obligations with a series of odd jobs. He tries selling magazines, which is a success for a while, though posing as Narcissus for two gay artists proves to be something of a disaster. Eventually, he woos Marietta, one of his other neighbors and a girl more suited to his age. But when things go really awry, Jojo becomes desperate and tries to commit suicide by jumping off the roof of his building", "poster_path": "/wAzxVpwQDiZlhIcDVnfHRt5u3bs.jpg", "release_date": "1960-11-30", "title": "Boulevard", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 4, "popularity": 1.618}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/tf8tBR7TYGvBFeTIF7YuSHgrRDb.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 63681, "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "Les Tricheurs", "overview": "Bob Letellier, a good looking rich kid who studies science, makes the acquaintance of Alain, a cynical and immoral young man.
