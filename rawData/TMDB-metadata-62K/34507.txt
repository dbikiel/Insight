Featuring interviews with nearly every major player past and present, as well as a few energetic live clips, Modulations delves into one of electronica's forgotten facets: the human element. Lee travels the globe from the American Midwest to Europe to Japan to try to express the appeal of music often dismissed as soulless. Modulations shows that behind even the most foreign or alien electronic composition lies a real human being, and Lee lets many of these Frankenstein-like creators express and expound upon their personal philosophies and tech-heavy theories.  Lee understands that a cultural movement as massive and diverse as dance music can't be contained.", "poster_path": "/gNQOhfUPPzWX1gIraRW60FbX0kH.jpg", "popularity": 3.155}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 13}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 4, "character": "Himself", "credit_id": "52fe45689251416c9103132b", "gender": 0, "id": 82994, "name": "Doug Stanhope", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/5W1SZJi3cfiKJ2Fc1HQane5XEek.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe45689251416c91031327", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 112589, "job": "Director", "name": "Shawn Amos", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe45689251416c91031331", "department": "Writing", "gender": 0, "id": 82994, "job": "Writer", "name": "Doug Stanhope", "profile_path": "/5W1SZJi3cfiKJ2Fc1HQane5XEek.jpg"}]}}
