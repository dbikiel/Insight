In a brave cinematic game, Heinrich B\u00f6ll\u2019s story Billiards at Half-Past Nine is split up into cracks, blocks, breaks and sudden turns, as the life story of a German family, covering numerous generations, is propelled forward. Terms such as \u201cinterwar period\u201d and \u201cpost-war period\u201d are blown up with a single cut, word or click of a billiard ball. Not Reconciled remains one of the most important German film of the past fifty years.", "poster_path": "/yf55EliFlzSUKsciMWtzs83F7wi.jpg", "popularity": 3.041}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/uDMWBO7oOYfV1bJ2U8SLVpGfZwT.jpg", "genre_ids": [16], "id": 134762, "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "La demoiselle et le violoncelliste", "overview": "A cellist attempts to rescue a woman swept out to sea, only to find he must battle a series of overly possesive sea creatures.", "poster_path": "/fK0OarfJgbx9KtJJgPVd9HWuOFn.jpg", "release_date": "1965-06-02", "title": "The Maid and the Cellist", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.4, "vote_count": 9, "popularity": 1.4}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [18], "id": 42495, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "King Lear", "overview": "King Lear, old and tired, divides his kingdom among his daughters, giving great importance to their protestations of love for him.
