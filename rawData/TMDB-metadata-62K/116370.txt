This alone is enough for me to believe in a certain beauty to life and to have the pleasure of attempting to film it in all its forms (trees, animals, gods, humans...) and to do so when love is intense. The filmmaker has lost a part of innocence. It's so difficult to spot it around you, so difficult not to lose it during a film shoot. I'm grateful to those who you look at on screen. To stand up to time, I've a tactic, which is to dig into my stock of emotions and old images. Not so as to find what will never come back, but to discover the signs of spring in winter. This allows me to begin another day with an easy, light step.\" (Alain Cavalier)", "poster_path": "/q6Av4LrcmGBGdneFhTVtiYnyBKR.jpg", "release_date": "2014-10-08", "title": "Paradise", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 7, "popularity": 1.164}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [10752, 14], "id": 376710, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "2nd War Hats", "overview": "", "poster_path": "/pcr2Vrxh15RFj3eHWfFX62jadZH.jpg", "release_date": "1986-01-01", "title": "2nd War Hats", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.3, "vote_count": 4, "popularity": 0.6}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99], "id": 128939, "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "La Seine a rencontr\u00e9 Paris", "overview": "This movie follows the river Seine from the countryside to the heart of Paris.", "poster_path": "/eB9i2VvSUyKxWuVcDAtqjVgP2r0.jpg", "release_date": "1957-11-20", "title": "The Seine Meets Paris", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.2, "vote_count": 6, "popularity": 1.979}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99], "id": 386335, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Vali", "overview": "A documentary portrait shot in Positano, Italy in 1965 about Australian artist and occultist Vali Myers.", "poster_path": "/lKcIRl4ixGCZ1NjKAOcPe4ccM2w.jpg", "release_date": "1967-06-01", "title": "Vali", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 4, "popularity": 0.961}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/8iCwliz1Sq11USlbtPlnMU3JsTp.jpg", "genre_ids": [35], "id": 44350, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Hor B'Levana", "overview": "A comic and episodic satire, the film uses improvisation to illustrate the clash between fantasy and reality in real life.

The technique of film within the film is used to portray cinema as reflection of the imagination, a miracle based on dreams and fantasies that take on concrete characteristics \u2013 parallel to the miracle of Israel, the dream that has become reality.
