Lula explains to his fellow passengers what the difference is between his labor party and social democratic parties elsewhere in the world.

His message: stay close to who you are \u2013 in Lula's eyes, authenticity is a prerequisite for political success. This serves as a leitmotif throughout Intermissions, which follows Lula during the hectic election campaign for the presidency in 2002. Lula gave filmmaker Jo\u00e3o Moreira Salles and his crew complete access, and the result is an intimate documentary of what went on behind the scenes. Sometimes, Lula is afraid that he will lose his freedom as president. Combined with Lula's candor, the film's observational style provides some very special insight into one of Brazil's most popular leaders.", "popularity": 2.119, "poster_path": "/8fnVwGOdB04guYw6PeJ6yVaJicX.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "BR", "name": "Brazil"}], "release_date": "2004-11-19", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 117, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "pt", "name": "Portugu\u00eas"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "Lula thirty days prior to power", "title": "Intermissions", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 4, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 104840, "video": false, "vote_count": 5, "vote_average": 7.0, "title": "Maranh\u00e3o 66", "release_date": "1966-01-01", "original_language": "pt", "original_title": "Maranh\u00e3o 66", "genre_ids": [99], "backdrop_path": "/gX2bks3fpMAys0gobEHPwMQUbpM.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A report on Sarney's inauguration as the governor of the Maranh\u00e3o state.
