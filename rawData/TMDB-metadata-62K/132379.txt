Lye transformed this footage in what has been described as the most intricate job of film printing and color grading ever attempted. Animated words and patterns combine with the live-action footage to create images as complex and multi-layered as a Cubist painting. Music was provided by the Cuban Lecuona Band. With its dynamic rhythms, the film seeks (in Lye\u2019s words) to convey \u201ca romanticism about the work of the everyday in all walks of life.\"", "poster_path": "/paT9OUHe4D0hyR4aggFqHa277Yl.jpg", "release_date": "1937-12-31", "title": "Trade Tattoo", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 14, "popularity": 1.665}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [37, 18, 35], "id": 104294, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Go West", "overview": "Western Movies with monkeys in the roles.
