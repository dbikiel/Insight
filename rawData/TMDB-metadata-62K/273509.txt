One day, while drawing water from the well, Pietro and Alice accidentally free something from Earth's womb. A strange and alien color flashes underwater, at the well's bottom, then disappears. From that moment on, inexplicable events start happening all around the farm, and by night the surrounding vegetation glitters with a sinister glow. The color soon takes hold of the whole farm, and dwelling inside Pietro and his family's minds, it brings them into its sick world of pain, blood and death.", "poster_path": "/AqkGTBnn1k1vhmAiwChNhlAd57Z.jpg", "release_date": "2008-10-19", "title": "Colour from the Dark", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.8, "vote_count": 10, "popularity": 2.943}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/90gdPCj0wGZZAuhXE8VjUUsrpo.jpg", "genre_ids": [27], "id": 148991, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Hellmaster", "overview": "A psychotic college professor uses unwitting students as laboratory rats, injecting them with a drug that mutates them into gory killers", "poster_path": "/8UreyrVc3cnPP1G2LPo7QtzBBl4.jpg", "release_date": "1992-12-16", "title": "Hellmaster", "video": false, "vote_average": 2.4, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 2.82}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/jZbN8KDUKQTpUvrcgNsTXKERokc.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 27, 53], "id": 31991, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Drifter: Henry Lee Lucas", "overview": "The true story of serial killer Henry Lee Lucas.", "poster_path": "/7njA2RUDlNSOWLrLSy3YfizQ5Ib.jpg", "release_date": "2009-09-01", "title": "Drifter: Henry Lee Lucas", "video": false, "vote_average": 3.6, "vote_count": 10, "popularity": 4.328}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [27], "id": 94862, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Plasterhead", "overview": "Every town has a local legend.

As the four friends quickly find out, some believe Williams still roams the woods on the outskirts of town, surviving on the slaughter of wildlife. Others claim to have seen Williams in person, a looming figure with a ghostly white visage, purportedly a makeshift cast to mask the scars and wounds left from the merciless assault.
