Charles Spaak's screenplay makes no attempt to launder the four principal characters (Marcel Mouloudji, Raymond Pellegrin, Antoinine Balpetre, Julien Verdeir): never mind the motivations, these are all hardened murderers. Still, the film condemns the sadistic ritual through which these four men are brought to the guillotine. In France, the policy is to never tell the condemned man when the execution will occur--and then to show up without warning and drag the victim kicking and screaming to his doom, without any opportunity to make peace with himself or his Maker. By the end of this harrowing film, the audience feels as dehumanized as the four \"protagonists.\" We Are All Murderers was roundly roasted by the French law enforcement establishment, but it won a special jury prize at the 1952 Cannes Film Festival.", "poster_path": "/7U6JtnM5NT6cz4xhB0SuUEJsObi.jpg", "release_date": "1952-06-06", "title": "We Are All Murderers", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.8, "vote_count": 4, "popularity": 1.669}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/yZ3wE9SbPkobmhxeHVml1RNOV6Y.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 10749], "id": 96811, "original_language": "ja", "original_title": "\u6731\u82b1\u306e\u6708", "overview": "Based on a Japanese novel written by Masako Bando, the story revolves around Kayoko who lives with one man (Tetsuya) but is in love with another (Takumi).", "poster_path": "/yHp8vWOkzfZLCd9faDP5WUn8cd6.jpg", "release_date": "2012-02-01", "title": "Hanezu", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 10, "popularity": 2.035}, {"id": 79382, "video": false, "vote_count": 72, "vote_average": 7.3, "title": "I Wish", "release_date": "2011-06-11", "original_language": "ja", "original_title": "\u5947\u8de1", "genre_ids": [18], "backdrop_path": "/f3mmWwpWEEU9vszZdh5Fy4cAHsy.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Two young brothers at opposite ends of Kyushu devise a magical plan to reunite their separated parents.", "poster_path": "/jLsUvhEgovME7dI283nnjqArmwI.jpg", "popularity": 7.178}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/pg6pgchA6ynfpe0ZQSfXwQbTxEy.jpg", "genre_ids": [10752, 18], "id": 333846, "original_language": "sr", "original_title": "Enklava", "overview": "Nenad, ten years Christian boy from a Serbian enclave, determined to create a proper community burial for his late grandfather, crosses enemy lines and makes friends among the Muslim majority in deeply divided, war-torn Kosovo.", "poster_path": "/awz6r8HFGBTT25V9MnQzxZBjTeh.jpg", "release_date": "2015-03-03", "title": "Enclave", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.2, "vote_count": 17, "popularity": 2.991}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/ZKRShrHJSI8mE0jSr2Rhb8gGbt.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 58777, "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "Y'aura t'il de la neige \u00e0 No\u00ebl ?", "overview": "A woman and her seven children live on a farm in Southern France.
