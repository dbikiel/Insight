It was from this top floor commune that the precocious 4-year-old Sean would occasionally wander downstairs to visit and talk-and one day Arlyck turned on his camera.  Sean\u2019s casual commentary on everything from smoking pot to living with speed freaks was delivered in simple sincerity throughout the soon-to-be famous 15-minute film. This First Child of the notorious decade may have shaken the audience with his simple sentence- \u201cSure, I smoke pot\u201d-but it was his barefoot impishness which would encapsulate the hope that lay in front of the nation: a promise of infinite possibility.", "poster_path": "/h0bOiz7VcmmcLoiOJVXLYuvt4bb.jpg", "release_date": "2006-05-05", "title": "Following Sean", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.4, "vote_count": 7, "popularity": 1.005}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/8nu9yfUnSaYhPAh7baOSjeMMdlW.jpg", "genre_ids": [99, 10752], "id": 33588, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "White Light/Black Rain: The Destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki", "overview": "Steven Okazaki presents a deeply moving look at the painful legacy of the first -- and hopefully last -- uses of thermonuclear weapons in war.
