Production of the epic was stopped before the third part could be filmed, due to producer dissatisfaction with Eisenstein's introducing forbidden experimental filming techniques into the material, more evident in this part than the first part.  As it was, this second part was banned from showings until after the deaths of both Eisenstein and Stalin, and a change of attitude by the subsequent heads of the Soviet government.  In this part, as Ivan the Terrible attempts to consolidate his power by establishing a personal army, his political rivals, the Russian boyars, plot to assassinate him.", "poster_path": "/9VufNqHN0EIkZAsJIv5vDYIitPo.jpg", "popularity": 5.946}, {"id": 118014, "video": false, "vote_count": 24, "vote_average": 7.1, "title": "The Seashell and the Clergyman", "release_date": "1928-02-09", "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "La coquille et le clergyman", "genre_ids": [9648], "backdrop_path": "/bNhLpSZVMjjmnK4GmSjYrlXlBdi.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Obsessed with a general's woman, a clergyman has strange visions of death and lust, struggling against his own eroticism.", "poster_path": "/x2AI6oNzvpgDAGu9UILgXZRPNP5.jpg", "popularity": 2.767}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/76ZSqCYTqF8CczNoqZnreEbpuyY.jpg", "genre_ids": [27, 35, 9648], "id": 76804, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Cat and the Canary", "overview": "Rich old Cyrus West's relatives are waiting for him to die so they can inherit.

O'Neill uses footage from several classic films to recreate the several layers of meaning emanating from the city, juxtaposing images and fantasies and hardly ever allowing one picture to go untouched.
