Later, a Navy officer calls his friend Cal for help. A Colombian drug lord is holding the ambassador, and the officer wants Cal to rescue the man. Cal convinces the officer to get a pardon for imprisoned explosives expert Rick, and together Cal and Rick form an uneasy partnership. They travel to meet Yolanda, a stripper who supposedly knows the location of this drug lord, named Perez (who looks like a creation out of Madame Tussaud's). Our threesome then sets about to rescue the ambassador. Cal, Rick, and Yolanda meet resistance at every turn; apparently Perez's men have the drop on them. After multiple shootouts, Cal convinces Yolanda to use her son as a pawn to draw Perez away from his home, and then all hell breaks loose.", "popularity": 0.6, "poster_path": "/quNNeaoAWMOPVuDNuJPtS8ItPBu.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "1992-11-25", "revenue": 0, "runtime": null, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "He's Dangerous He's Destructive and he's dead serious.", "title": "Three Days To A Kill", "video": false, "vote_average": 4.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 2, "character": "Cal", "credit_id": "52fe4ec3c3a36847f82a65e3", "gender": 2, "id": 9811, "name": "Fred Williamson", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/tc4K1y80KA8RrVR8tvmSNCuvWa8.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "Rick", "credit_id": "52fe4ec3c3a36847f82a65e7", "gender": 2, "id": 30044, "name": "Bo Svenson", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/xhXC4Vx1T2NwFgadIjgdISM09ia.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Perez", "credit_id": "52fe4ec3c3a36847f82a65eb", "gender": 2, "id": 14731, "name": "Henry Silva", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/jRsXbYfr0t2ohfofil8WikkAOtT.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Comm.
