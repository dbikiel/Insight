Filmed live at the Warner Theatre in Washington D.C., Assassin features a fresh dose of Margaret\u2019s ground-breaking and controversial brand of humor. Taking aim at the Bush administration and the religious right, she pulls no punches in her assault on the \"ever devolving\" state of the union. The result is an unforgettable performance featuring Margaret at her raw, irreverent and hilarious best.", "poster_path": "/fB0v0TM0Z34fEFQRIDCK3HIT8M4.jpg", "release_date": "2005-10-23", "title": "Margaret Cho: Assassin", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.2, "vote_count": 6, "popularity": 1.411}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/3rEWOx2TxRNTUpVo34zg4Slrxzq.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 71507, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Jailbait", "overview": "Randy commits a crime that would normally get him probation and a hefty fine, but in the \"three-strikes\" world of justice, he finds himself locked up for 25 years.

Jake recognizes Randy's fear and offers him advice on how to make it in prison. But it soon becomes clear that Jake has much more than mentoring in mind as he takes Randy under his wing. \"Jailbait\" sets a darkly cerebral tone, juxtaposing brutality with the unattainable ideal of intimacy in the harshest of psychological environments. For these two men so yearning to be anything but who they are and where they are, power is the goal, and it's never clear who truly holds it right up to the last unsettling moment", "poster_path": "/b7IBftqUp78x9VgbSI8zWaJUS2u.jpg", "release_date": "2004-05-03", "title": "Jailbait", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 3, "popularity": 3.05}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [18], "id": 201139, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Last Year", "overview": "Paul's homosexual affair at Bible College with a new student named Alex sets tongues wagging, mostly with un-Christian reactions.
