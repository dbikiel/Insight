The camera zooms in into the boy's mind and a slow, sad waltz (i.e.\"Valse Triste\") accompanies images of a locomotive, a miner, the globe, the sky, a sheep heard, etc. Disparate elements, but if one concentrates only at the movement of the figures, one can perceive a commotion, slowly livening up: The starting wheels of the heavy locomotive, the tired miner pushing the heavy cart of coal bricks, the globe smoothly turning around and around, the clouds imperceptibly floating in the sky, the sheep idly moving in the herd, etc.  We reach the first climax when a mannequin opens her coat like a flower. The second big crescendo spurts out from a \"water hose\", after watching schoolgirls doing gymnastics for quite a while. A sad, but nostalgic aftertaste lingers in the end when funeral cars drive away through a flooded area\u2026", "poster_path": "/fsLJMk1dPfzr5qXd3IRSmZRxpX6.jpg", "release_date": "1977-06-01", "title": "Valse Triste", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.1, "vote_count": 9, "popularity": 2.37}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 154612, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Birth of Magellan: Cadenza I", "overview": "Hollis Frampton alludes to origins and creation as he cuts between a garden featuring a bride and groom and an 1902 film entitled \"A Little Piece of String.\"", "poster_path": "/hrg5cK5zh4b0tVkEfPTEfDq4Ds2.jpg", "release_date": "1977-12-31", "title": "The Birth of Magellan: Cadenza I", "video": false, "vote_average": 3.7, "vote_count": 9, "popularity": 1.821}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 189495, "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "Cinq minutes de cin\u00e9ma pur", "overview": "Avant-garde short focused on the pure elements of film like form, visual composition, and rhythm.", "poster_path": "/9j60uN74DMpwhaDeHNg5j49pWbA.jpg", "release_date": "1926-01-01", "title": "Five Minutes of Pure Cinema", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.6, "vote_count": 10, "popularity": 1.439}, {"id": 144694, "video": false, "vote_count": 17, "vote_average": 6.9, "title": "The Vampire", "release_date": "1945-12-31", "original_language": "fr", "original_title": "Le vampire", "genre_ids": [99], "backdrop_path": null, "adult": false, "overview": "After a look at some strange creatures, the narrator and camera take us to the Chaco forest, on the borders of Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil, where a vampire bat lives, desmodus rotondus, attacking wildlife and domesticated creatures, killing small ones by draining all their blood and killing large ones by leaving a parasite in their bloodstream.
