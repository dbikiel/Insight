Through extensive research and interviews with the nation\u2019s top divorce lawyers, mediators, judges, politicians, litigants and journalists, DIVORCE CORP. uncovers how children are torn from their homes, unlicensed custody evaluators extort money, and abusive judges play god with people\u2019s lives while enriching their friends. This explosive documentary reveals the family courts as unregulated, extra-constitutional fiefdoms. Rather than assist victims of domestic crimes, these courts often precipitate them. And rather than help parents and children move on, as they are mandated to do, these courts - and their associates - drag out cases for years, sometimes decades, ultimately resulting in a rash of social ills, including home foreclosure, bankruptcy, suicide and violence.", "popularity": 2.591, "poster_path": "/5ZI3ecraeoUbJ6zLaZ8CBEYea4F.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2014-01-10", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 88, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Divorce Corp.", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.8, "vote_count": 8, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 103602, "video": false, "vote_count": 4, "vote_average": 4.5, "title": "Demolition High", "release_date": "1996-04-12", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Demolition High", "genre_ids": [28], "backdrop_path": null, "adult": false, "overview": "When a group of terrorists (led by Luther) take over a high school making the students in it their hostages, it is up to several of the students (led by Lenny) to help prevent disaster while the authorities (Slater and General Wainwright) do their part on the other side.", "poster_path": "/p70T94feMhymjddRBtEbQRxFy1r.jpg", "popularity": 2.337}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/apu7zAFAR8J23Y9sNgnmkQaQqIm.jpg", "genre_ids": [53, 18, 878], "id": 362203, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Shelter", "overview": "After a cataclysmic event, five strangers sealed inside an emergency shelter with all the comforts of home must learn to cope with their situation and with each other.", "poster_path": "/6QgsjYODmdh46nl2XKg77EV1wAr.jpg", "release_date": "2015-04-21", "title": "Shelter", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 7, "popularity": 2.894}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/zneHhKTOP0Evu2nbvoLGLYuco9B.jpg", "genre_ids": [35], "id": 78232, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Bring Me the Head of Mavis Davis", "overview": "Marty's about to make a killing in the music business", "poster_path": "/oRqyLs1NkDbYaOLHjDSX3ozCqM4.jpg", "release_date": "1997-01-16", "title": "Bring Me the Head of Mavis Davis", "video": false, "vote_average": 3.5, "vote_count": 6, "popularity": 2.312}, {"id": 41973, "video": false, "vote_count": 7, "vote_average": 6.7, "title": "Thelonious Monk: Straight, No Chaser", "release_date": "1988-10-25", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Thelonious Monk: Straight, No Chaser", "genre_ids": [99, 10402], "backdrop_path": "/m7NussHojl4435pdfzQHrXddNFl.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A documentary film about the life of pianist and jazz great Thelonious Monk.
