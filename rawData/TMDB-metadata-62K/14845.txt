Sara returns to help settle his estate, and all our ladies cross paths with an eclectic group of local oddballs, as they search for a Loch Ness-style monster they believe lurks in the lake's depths. A few real Smith Mountain Lake characters make appearances. The next week at the lake is filled with adventure, tears, and laughter as Vivian and her two daughters finally understand, through the guidance of Dad's spirit, if they still belong on the lake, even though Ray is gone. All paths converge at the Smith Mountain Lake Wine Festival, on course for a heart-warming and hilarious collision.

As grunge took over MTV and radio, the music industry was transformed overnight. But just three years later, the drug-related deaths of several musicians, capped by the suicide of Kurt Cobain, closed the books on an all too brief era. Hit So Hard follows the rise to fame (and the near-fatal fall from it) of Patty Schemel, drummer for Courtney Love's seminal rock band, Hole. Given a Hi-8 video camera just before Hole's infamous Live Through This world tour, Patty captured stunningly intimate footage of the scene that has never been seen... until now. Not just an all-access backstage pass to the music that shaped a generation, Hit So Hard is a harrowing tale of overnight success, the cost of addiction, and ultimately, recovery and redemption.", "poster_path": "/f1SkSlIEMBmyMGVvZRR1qIEcucM.jpg", "release_date": "2012-04-20", "title": "Hit So Hard", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.8, "vote_count": 8, "popularity": 2.241}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/iPRKgNK9Gls5djXpO4e94fQxPmh.jpg", "genre_ids": [], "id": 543889, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "An Audience of Chairs", "overview": "Maura Mackenzie (Carolina Bartczak) believes the world is hers to conquer.
