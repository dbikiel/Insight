As the film progresses, Patsy must also learn to deal with her new affliction and to live her life, no longer in her romantic dream world, but in a harsher yet ultimately more satisfying reality.  Shot in Techniscope with a 1:2.35 aspect ratio, an old process used in many 1960's films such as Dario Argento's \"The Cat O' Nine Tails\", GRAVEYARD ALIVE promises to invigorate the horror genre stylistically as well as with its audacious and thought-provoking content.", "poster_path": "/xuF0B6MulvTprDGEp9M0jnNFr4s.jpg", "release_date": "2003-01-01", "title": "Graveyard Alive- A Zombie Nurse in Love", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.6, "vote_count": 7, "popularity": 3.725}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/uJ2NzQ08gnfn2qaVJr4SbFnMzyn.jpg", "genre_ids": [27, 9648], "id": 39986, "original_language": "ja", "original_title": "\u6c5f\u6238\u5ddd\u4e71\u6b69\u5168\u96c6\u3000\u6050\u6016\u5947\u5f62\u4eba\u9593", "overview": "Hirosuke (Teruo Yoshida) , a medical student with almost no recollection of his past, is trapped in an asylum, despite being perfectly sane.

Whilst at the Komoda household, Hirosuke recalls memories that convince him to travel to a nearby island, home of Jogoro, the web-fingered father of Genzaburo.
