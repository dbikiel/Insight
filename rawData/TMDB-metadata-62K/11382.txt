Agreeing to this first compromise is the first step to Broadway's complete seduction of David, who neglects longtime girl friend Ellen. Meanwhile David puts up with Warner Purcell, the leading man who is a compulsive eater, Helen Sinclair, the grand dame who wants her part jazzed up, and Cheech, Olive's interfering hitman / bodyguard. Eventually, the playwright must decide whether art or life is more important.", "popularity": 10.07, "poster_path": "/tfplmiNdTDHHbZZ8AGmXBiB1xJj.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 14, "logo_path": "/m6AHu84oZQxvq7n1rsvMNJIAsMu.png", "name": "Miramax", "origin_country": "US"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1994-10-14", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 98, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Bullets Over Broadway", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.2, "vote_count": 268, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 1808, "name": "lover (female)"}, {"id": 2276, "name": "talent"}, {"id": 6220, "name": "mafia boss"}, {"id": 10818, "name": "author"}, {"id": 10965, "name": "playwright"}, {"id": 14512, "name": "new york city, usa"}, {"id": 156028, "name": "broadway"}, {"id": 207876, "name": "1920s"}, {"id": 254769, "name": "compulsive eating"}, {"id": 255310, "name": "bad acting"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 311, "video": false, "vote_count": 2593, "vote_average": 8.4, "title": "Once Upon a Time in America", "release_date": "1984-05-23", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Once Upon a Time in America", "genre_ids": [80, 18], "backdrop_path": "/vnT6HzjLSDrAweHn9xWykb8Ii6T.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A former Prohibition-era Jewish gangster returns to the Lower East Side of Manhattan over thirty years later, where he once again must confront the ghosts and regrets of his old life.", "poster_path": "/x733R4ISI0RbKeHhVkXdTMFmTFr.jpg", "popularity": 23.555}, {"id": 194662, "video": false, "vote_count": 8616, "vote_average": 7.5, "title": "Birdman", "release_date": "2014-08-27", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Birdman", "genre_ids": [35, 18], "backdrop_path": "/AsJVim0Hk3KbQPbfjyijfjqmaoZ.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A fading actor best known for his portrayal of a popular superhero attempts to mount a comeback by appearing in a Broadway play.
