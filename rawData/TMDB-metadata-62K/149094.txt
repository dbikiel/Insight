Quiet, and meditative, what emerges most strongly is an eerie sense of city landscapes as deserted film sets, in which the desolate architecture overwhelms any sense of reality. The only reassurance that we are not in some endless machine-Metropolis is the shadow of daytime activity: a juggernaut plunging through a darkened village, a plague of small birds in the predawn light. The whole thing is underscored by a beautiful \u2018composed\u2019 soundtrack, from quietly humming streetlights to reggae and the rumble of armoured cars in Belfast. A strange and remarkable combination of dream, documentary and science-fiction.", "popularity": 0.802, "poster_path": "/hBgVPGZCTClqQzfVbxoZGpQmuCp.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 4606, "logo_path": "/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png", "name": "ZDF", "origin_country": "DE"}, {"id": 79339, "logo_path": null, "name": "Ombra-Film", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 23072, "logo_path": null, "name": "Schweizerische Radio- und Fernsehgesellschaft (SRG)", "origin_country": "CH"}, {"id": 22642, "logo_path": "/gqFSMOsv68FkYalHrKbUvq3pGwh.png", "name": "Ina", "origin_country": "FR"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}, {"iso_3166_1": "CH", "name": "Switzerland"}, {"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "1979-11-30", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 61, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Story of Night", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.0, "vote_count": 4, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 149940, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Double Tide", "overview": "Double Tide documents the work of a female clam digger in the mudflats of coastal Maine and is filmed on the rare occasion in which low tide occurs twice within daylight hours\u2014once at dawn and once at dusk.", "poster_path": "/3WYMMQCv2Z2T3FjaZAcETplEzZ8.jpg", "release_date": "2009-10-21", "title": "Double Tide", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.3, "vote_count": 4, "popularity": 2.151}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99], "id": 215605, "original_language": "de", "original_title": "Taiga", "overview": "The Darkhad and Soyon Uriyanghai peoples live in a vast valley in Northern Mongolia, much as their ancestors have for centuries. \"Taiga\" is the record of a long period spent by the German filmmaker Ulrike Ottinger among these people.", "poster_path": "/5JpKmOoYAFu57n0dG52mFCngRmh.jpg", "release_date": "1992-02-21", "title": "Taiga", "video": false, "vote_average": 8.3, "vote_count": 4, "popularity": 1.152}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99], "id": 154211, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Sogobi", "overview": "Many films by this master of landscape cinema are cinematic studies of specific landscapes, as is the case with SOGOBI \u2013 the Shoshonean word for \"Earth\" \u2013, Benning's approach to the Californian wilderness in 35 carefully composed scenes with a great depth of field and devoid of humans. \"I spent a year in the middle of nowhere and perhaps this is the closest I've come to portraying a true sense of place.\" (James Benning)", "poster_path": "/4wfEuYOBhgBjsng7kGTDvoJbWRF.jpg", "release_date": "2002-01-12", "title": "Sogobi", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.3, "vote_count": 4, "popularity": 1.4}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99], "id": 196681, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "In Public", "overview": "A fragmentary landscape for a little train station in a suburban area and a bus stop in a mining town.
