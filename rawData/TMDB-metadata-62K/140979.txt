Borowczyk described the film himself as \"A report on the city of angels.\"", "poster_path": "/zWnQHqbkJbeQo6edBD9KLmVBjI.jpg", "release_date": "1964-12-31", "title": "The Games of Angels", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.5, "vote_count": 22, "popularity": 3.083}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99], "id": 132392, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "A Diary for Timothy", "overview": "This brief documentary-style film presents the status of Great Britain near the end of the Second World War by means of a visual diary for a baby boy born in September, 1944.
