Pierre has gone too far and put the family firm in jeopardy. They ask him to expatriate. To avoid scandal, Pierre joins the Foreign Legion. In Morocco, near the desert, Pierre goes with his comrades of the Legion to a bar-restaurant-brothel, owned by a shady character, Mr. Clement . Clement lives more or less with Ms.Blanche  who is a fortune teller with cards, as a hobby. But Clement is also after his girls now and then. Pierre is still obsessed with Florence but he meets Irma , one of Clement's girls, who is the double of Florence except for hair color. Irma has had an accident and has lost part of her memory at a certain point of her recent past, and Pierre slowly persuades himself she is Florence, but cannot remember it. Advised by Ms.Blanche, Irma finally accepts to act as if she was Florence because she is falling in love with Pierre.", "popularity": 1.4, "poster_path": "/w8cqUkGJpzJ09ORIh88u56Tezpn.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "1934-05-02", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 110, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Le Grand Jeu", "video": false, "vote_average": 8.0, "vote_count": 3, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 2, "character": "Florence / Irma", "credit_id": "553810839251411fd00012f4", "gender": 0, "id": 239232, "name": "Marie Bell", "order": 1, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "Pierre Martel / Pierre Muller", "credit_id": "553810979251411256003781", "gender": 2, "id": 992827, "name": "Pierre Richard-Willm", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/3efRdKEdpuPlOXaZTPd5YkuyACv.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Clement", "credit_id": "553810a1c3a368502b000173", "gender": 2, "id": 2566, "name": "Charles Vanel", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/n2QkGhxuFmGoDyzGUHxdKQfMQX2.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Nicolas Ivanoff", "credit_id": "553810bbc3a368502b000178", "gender": 0, "id": 1457969, "name": "Georges Pitoeff", "order": 4, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 6, "character": "Le colonel", "credit_id": "553810c69251414201004d81", "gender": 0, "id": 320107, "name": "Camille Bert", "order": 5, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 7, "character": "Bernard Martel", "credit_id": "553810da92514166aa007ccd", "gender": 0, "id": 1342466, "name": "Andr\u00e9 Dubosc", "order": 6, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 8, "character": "Gustin", "credit_id": "553810e692514138a90002be", "gender": 2, "id": 12269, "name": "Pierre Larquey", "order": 7, "profile_path": "/4rkKv3jTLJsk80pJ0AwZSgF88B4.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 9, "character": "La m\u00f4me Dauville", "credit_id": "553810ffc3a36842ae005968", "gender": 0, "id": 1372302, "name": "Lyne Clevers", "order": 8, "profile_path": "/hXRmpAH1DTkucGuGo7aT8w0xWKt.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 10, "character": "Aziani", "credit_id": "55381111c3a36831dd005aed", "gender": 2, "id": 1373068, "name": "Harry Nestor", "order": 9, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 11, "character": "Le capitaine", "credit_id": "5538111ec3a368502b000189", "gender": 0, "id": 992679, "name": "Pierre de Guingand", "order": 10, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 12, "character": "Fenoux", "credit_id": "55381130c3a36842ae005970", "gender": 2, "id": 263123, "name": "Louis Florencie", "order": 11, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 13, "character": "Le cantinier", "credit_id": "55381142c3a3684c5b000cde", "gender": 2, "id": 298988, "name": "Pierre Labry", "order": 12, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 14, "character": "LA voix d'Irma", "credit_id": "553811529251416518007362", "gender": 0, "id": 931203, "name": "Claude Marcy", "order": 13, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 15, "character": "A\u00efchouch", "credit_id": "5538116cc3a3681be4002eac", "gender": 0, "id": 1457970, "name": "Olga Velbria", "order": 14, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 16, "character": "Blanche", "credit_id": "553811819251411fd0001322", "gender": 1, "id": 100033, "name": "Fran\u00e7oise Rosay", "order": 15, "profile_path": "/yrpf7xTGO1EdKRcyLRnP21MtjP2.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "57ebf767c3a36839f1000063", "department": "Camera", "gender": 2, "id": 10537, "job": "Director of Photography", "name": "Harry Stradling Sr.", "profile_path": "/zrOonlDitklFugniihdlLloxGFO.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "52fe4ca6c3a36847f8238691", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 109342, "job": "Director", "name": "Jacques Feyder", "profile_path": "/bSqyPHzYvVAWE5tmCR4iA3r7HwZ.jpg"}]}}
