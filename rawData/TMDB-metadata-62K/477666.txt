Life in the orphanage is devoid of love and offers only minimal physical comforts. Sometimes life there is brutal.

One day something goes wrong and the teacher is forced to punish Marian who retaliates by stabbing her. Marian is a teen by the time he is released from a juvenile reformatory. He falls in love for the first time, but because it is a foreign emotion, he doesn't know how to deal with it.
