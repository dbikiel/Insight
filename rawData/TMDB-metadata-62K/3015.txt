Released in 1920, this is one of Murnau's lost films. While the film itself does not survive, the scripts and related production notes do. Because the film is lost, its full length is unknown.  Dr. Warren is the Dr. Jekyll character who changes into Mr. O'Connor, a parallel of Mr. Hyde. This transformation is brought about, not by experimentation with chemicals as in Stevenson's original, but through the supernatural agency of a bust of Janus (the Roman god of the doorway), which Warren / O'Connor purchases in the opening sequence as a gift for his sweetheart, Jane. When she refuses the gift, horrified, Warren / O'Connor is forced to keep the statuette himself...", "popularity": 0.732, "poster_path": "/d8KLZs3GuUO1b9ejghL5YCMbeSu.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 1289, "logo_path": null, "name": "Lipow-Film", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "DE", "name": "Germany"}], "release_date": "1920-08-26", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 107, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "de", "name": "Deutsch"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Head of Janus", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 848, "name": "double life"}, {"id": 46958, "name": "good and bad"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 268, "video": false, "vote_count": 4351, "vote_average": 7.1, "title": "Batman", "release_date": "1989-06-23", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Batman", "genre_ids": [28, 14], "backdrop_path": "/2blmxp2pr4BhwQr74AdCfwgfMOb.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "The Dark Knight of Gotham City begins his war on crime with his first major enemy being the clownishly homicidal Joker, who has seized control of Gotham's underworld.", "poster_path": "/kBf3g9crrADGMc2AMAMlLBgSm2h.jpg", "popularity": 24.217}, {"id": 415, "video": false, "vote_count": 2998, "vote_average": 4.2, "title": "Batman & Robin", "release_date": "1997-06-20", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Batman & Robin", "genre_ids": [28, 35, 14, 878], "backdrop_path": "/tgPFZxhDuxWd4VXYaz8eAUznGTF.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "Along with crime-fighting partner Robin and new recruit Batgirl, Batman battles the dual threat of frosty genius Mr. Freeze and homicidal horticulturalist Poison Ivy.
