Instead, she began a lifelong crusade to speak out about injustice and oppression in any form.", "poster_path": "/fmKMKRqCVDYP6sIUw1HLRCCP8Kd.jpg", "release_date": "1965-11-08", "title": "The Eleanor Roosevelt Story", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 2.529}, {"id": 65991, "video": false, "vote_count": 7, "vote_average": 6.0, "title": "Hunt the Man Down", "release_date": "1950-12-26", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Hunt the Man Down", "genre_ids": [80, 9648], "backdrop_path": "/vdFm47Y0En8NgYXHbI0NCg63Ua9.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A lawyer uncovers secrets behind a 12-year-old murder case.", "poster_path": "/jdFhPDswhOovFyxYBNEaaZwHqCh.jpg", "popularity": 2.792}, {"id": 173873, "video": false, "vote_count": 5, "vote_average": 5.8, "title": "Courage for Every Day", "release_date": "1964-01-01", "original_language": "cs", "original_title": "Ka\u017ed\u00fd den odvahu", "genre_ids": [18], "backdrop_path": "/zajakx3X4HlN7yvTMumPJHLwqQg.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A passionate communist worker is discouraged by the changing political climate and the failure of his peers to live up to his ideals.", "poster_path": "/qR1Wrk7CqXb9FYtOGUL96EwCqx2.jpg", "popularity": 1.649}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/oU2ZzVjqEA3KMxnDQehg1chkHcW.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 167235, "original_language": "de", "original_title": "Hitlerjunge Quex", "overview": "A Nazi propaganda film based upon the life and death of Hitler Youth Heini Volker, killed while distributing flyers in a Communist neighborhood.", "poster_path": "/6mdG71sZSttD1FUBaJZYHK6JsWy.jpg", "release_date": "1933-09-10", "title": "Hitlerjunge Quex", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.2, "vote_count": 6, "popularity": 2.902}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/77ETiF1Vh0mjWoOZ9MZl4YR2QXI.jpg", "genre_ids": [9648, 18], "id": 77678, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Talk About a Stranger", "overview": "Small-town gossips rage over the arrival of a mysterious stranger.", "poster_path": "/tERZbSpE0vcPMd3ffpYotRo3lFW.jpg", "release_date": "1952-04-18", "title": "Talk About a Stranger", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 7, "popularity": 3.377}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/ekSI8N8VxGMHBu8nvqc4dAvmFkG.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 185078, "original_language": "it", "original_title": "Senza piet\u00e0", "overview": "An Italian sex worker falls in love with a black American soldier during World War II.", "poster_path": "/fETvnZMnVAGRqUYINZuWvrItZl.jpg", "release_date": "1948-08-04", "title": "Without Pity", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.2, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 2.198}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/jrSkpcXZZsc0TOmc7UMXyPrlJrd.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 80], "id": 60606, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "The Sun Sets at Dawn", "overview": "A reporter investigates the story of a young man who may have been wrongly convicted and sentenced to be executed.", "poster_path": "/hnYkEuJ927Q7vsZs7VUjjaUDCJJ.jpg", "release_date": "1950-11-01", "title": "The Sun Sets at Dawn", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.8, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 2.093}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/tp4b2eFQ2KW1zAnKahLlBXTd7Oc.jpg", "genre_ids": [80], "id": 42838, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Whispering Footsteps", "overview": "An Ohio bank clerk's life becomes a nightmare when his descriptions is a fit of a maniac killer.", "poster_path": "/zCMaDRgbiUtBgmRN3SPNrCoSxd5.jpg", "release_date": "1943-12-30", "title": "Whispering Footsteps", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.6, "vote_count": 5, "popularity": 5.061}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [], "id": 339876, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "I, Dalio", "overview": "The great French actor, Marcel Dalio, who has the lead role in Jean Renoir's THE RULES OF THE GAME, also appears in Renoir's GRAND ILLUSION.

In fact, in most of the French films he's in the 1930s, he almost always plays shady characters, informers, blackmailers and gangsters. In other words, he is always \"the Jew.\" When the Nazis invaded France in 1940, he fled to America and appeared in CASABLANCA and TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT. In America, he was no longer the Jew but The Frenchman. He became, in dozens of films, America's idea of a typical Frenchman. His film career has these two strands in which he has two different identities. Are you defined by other people and their perceptions of who you are? Are you always a creation of the way people want to see you?
