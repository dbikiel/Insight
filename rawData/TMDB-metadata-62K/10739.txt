Producer Julian Marx finally finds funding for the project from gangster Nick Valenti. The catch is that Nick's girl friend Olive Neal gets the part of a psychiatrist, and Olive is a bimbo who could never pass for a psychiatrist as well as being a dreadful actress.

Meanwhile David puts up with Warner Purcell, the leading man who is a compulsive eater, Helen Sinclair, the grand dame who wants her part jazzed up, and Cheech, Olive's interfering hitman / bodyguard. Eventually, the playwright must decide whether art or life is more important.", "poster_path": "/tfplmiNdTDHHbZZ8AGmXBiB1xJj.jpg", "release_date": "1994-10-14", "title": "Bullets Over Broadway", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.2, "vote_count": 268, "popularity": 10.07}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/xS01X3FDDYvDNdoj9hEqsUH9iBy.jpg", "genre_ids": [18], "id": 15867, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Interiors", "overview": "A look at a dysfunctional family dominated by the controlling madness of its matriarch, Eve.
