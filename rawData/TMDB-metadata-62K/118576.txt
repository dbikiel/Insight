She recommends it to a neurotic artist played by Tully Marshall (Queen Kelly), because \"it kindles the fires of genius.\" The artist quickly becomes addicted to the drug and the quality of his work begins to disintegrate. He takes on a new model, marries her, and starts her on the same path of moral degradation, until a guilt-ridden Renee decides to intervene in order to save them both. According to silent film historian Kevin Brownlow, THE DEVIL'S NEEDLE was banned by the state of Ohio, but the censor board reversed its decision after recognizing the positive message beneath the film's scandalous surface. This special edition was mastered from a 35mm preservation print of the 1923 re-release version. The only known surviving copy, the element suffers significant nitrate decomposition during some scenes.", "popularity": 1.173, "poster_path": "/2X9Wfg08xpOcFNSKvqLCPXlPJNQ.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 36191, "logo_path": null, "name": "Fine Arts Film Company", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "1916-08-12", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 66, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "The Devil's Needle", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 2, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 2, "character": "Renee Duprez", "credit_id": "52fe4bdec3a36847f8217315", "gender": 1, "id": 587953, "name": "Norma Talmadge", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/5kujtmGIpXS9EnywuviAbXNdHz6.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "John Minturn", "credit_id": "58efb81492514118cc0000a1", "gender": 2, "id": 13359, "name": "Tully Marshall", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/zywfVcAvVfinpH4wI7f7wvgdDr9.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 6, "character": "Patricia Devon", "credit_id": "58efb81d92514118c80000ba", "gender": 1, "id": 1119768, "name": "Marguerite Marsh", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/6OHRbDPr5saMLbG6pp5DM9fha8e.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 7, "character": "Marshall Devon", "credit_id": "58efb827c3a3685bfe0000a7", "gender": 2, "id": 29951, "name": "F.A.
