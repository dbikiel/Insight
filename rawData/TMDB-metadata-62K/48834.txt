With unprecedented access over a two-year period, including her private video diaries, the film layers Chely's rise to fame while hiding in the late 90's with the execution of her coming out plan, culminating in the exciting moment when she steps into the media glare to reveal she is gay. The film shows both the devastation of internalized homophobia and the transformational power of living an authentic life. The film also documents the conflicting responses from Nashville, the heartland and the LGBT community as Chely Wright prepares for an unknown future.", "poster_path": "/ur3rR54oya50W5M4jaGK8FytFR0.jpg", "release_date": "2011-06-22", "title": "Chely Wright: Wish Me Away", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.9, "vote_count": 7, "popularity": 0.986}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/dW8plSBJiSNRxBnqxoOjc8f17Zq.jpg", "genre_ids": [99], "id": 323404, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Hotel 22", "overview": "Each night in Silicon Valley, the Line 22 transforms from a public city bus into an unofficial shelter for the homeless in one of the richest parts of the world.", "poster_path": "/u3AmQsZUFxvTMubKWDJqE6lsXZl.jpg", "release_date": "2014-10-01", "title": "Hotel 22", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.0, "vote_count": 4, "popularity": 1.339}, {"id": 57022, "video": false, "vote_count": 15, "vote_average": 6.1, "title": "Sunshine State", "release_date": "2002-06-21", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Sunshine State", "genre_ids": [18], "backdrop_path": "/xnJajOjM8E3tlitvsEGWGiyNh6j.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A woman and her new husband returns to her hometown roots in coastal northern Florida, and must deal with family, business, and encroaching real estate development.", "poster_path": "/zsTbgzSqRWyHo2RtH0AH41OhMOj.jpg", "popularity": 5.063}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [35, 16], "id": 48611, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Cavallette", "overview": "An animated short by Bruno Bozzetto which condenses the whole of human civilization into 9 minutes, focusing primarily on the human race's predilection for warfare and the vanity of war.
