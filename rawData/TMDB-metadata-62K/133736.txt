Hosted by Mo Rocca (a Correspondent for CBS News, a panelist on NPR's 'Wait, Wait ... Don't Tell Me!' and a former Correspondent for 'The Daily Show'), the film is structured as a road trip that begins when Mo makes an eye-opening discovery: The Constitution does not guarantee the right to vote, putting America in the company of Libya, Iran and Indonesia. Mo explores the battle over voter fraud and voter I.D.; searches for the Electoral College; critiques ballot design with Todd Oldham; and encounters experts and activists across the political spectrum who offer commentary on why our voting system is broken and how it can be fixed.", "popularity": 2.041, "poster_path": "/56xojLQwQEMGd4nv4WVPI6wJ1b9.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "US", "name": "United States of America"}], "release_date": "2012-11-20", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 90, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Electoral Dysfunction", "video": false, "vote_average": 0.0, "vote_count": 0, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 4, "character": "Host", "credit_id": "52fe4bbbc3a368484e196ec9", "gender": 2, "id": 210461, "name": "Mo Rocca", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/n9QMY97OY224sKLXHjlFLITdJJR.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4bbbc3a368484e196eb9", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1097863, "job": "Director", "name": "David Deschamps", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe4bbbc3a368484e196ebf", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 1097864, "job": "Director", "name": "Leslie D.
