A vividly realistic psychosexual drama, the film\u2019s sharp emotional honesty heralds a distinct new voice from a promising young director. Hattu soon reveals that Maite\u2019s husband Vincent is in prison for an unspecified crime, and that she has promised to wait for him and attend to his laundry (if not his conjugal needs) during his incarceration. On one of her weekly visits, Maite meets Jean, an oddly inquisitive and boldly flirtatious prison warden, and soon the two commence a joyless affair. Seemingly smitten with Maite, Jean, in a gesture of kindness to his lover, eases up on her husband behind bars; the two become pals and even engage in some homoerotic shower talk. \u2014Robert O\u2019Shaughnessy", "popularity": 1.727, "poster_path": "/a7B2FXqDgLJlYdn9ZBk4vlXbzDq.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "FR", "name": "France"}], "release_date": "2006-01-01", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 86, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "7 Years", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 2, "character": "Ma\u00eft\u00e9", "credit_id": "5419f57a0e0a261644000379", "gender": 1, "id": 19937, "name": "Val\u00e9rie Donzelli", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/ufXuBQAGyHM0waKt6ru4jlHiJng.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 3, "character": "Jean", "credit_id": "5419f58b0e0a26163b000357", "gender": 2, "id": 151177, "name": "Cyril Troley", "order": 2, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Vincent", "credit_id": "5419f59bc3a3685bb8000326", "gender": 2, "id": 56285, "name": "Bruno Todeschini", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/pQTC4RrrEbshv5B5nDsykPQw1tq.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Julien", "credit_id": "5419f5ae0e0a26164a000371", "gender": 0, "id": 1365031, "name": "Pablo de la Torre", "order": 4, "profile_path": null}, {"cast_id": 6, "character": "Djamila", "credit_id": "5419f5bdc3a3685ba300032a", "gender": 0, "id": 267918, "name": "Nadia Kaci", "order": 5, "profile_path": "/vG3mwaoEIQ7STVmQaEUGKfKozmf.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 7, "character": "le surveillant", "credit_id": "5419f5d10e0a26163b000362", "gender": 0, "id": 1365034, "name": "Arnaud Toussaint", "order": 6, "profile_path": null}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe46cec3a36847f811326d", "department": "Directing", "gender": 0, "id": 49861, "job": "Director", "name": "Jean-Pascal Hattu", "profile_path": null}]}}
