However, none of this does much to reassure Ponette or clarify her confusion about the practical realities and spiritual dilemma posed by death. In time, Ponette and her cousins Matiaz (Matiaz Caton) and Delphine (Delphine Schiltz) are sent off to boarding school, where they have to resolve their confusion and loss on their own. ~Mark Deming, Rovi", "poster_path": "/32289bKHzGO4lyD8lUUIFYA5e5R.jpg", "release_date": "1996-09-10", "title": "Ponette", "video": false, "vote_average": 7.6, "vote_count": 18, "popularity": 2.775}], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 11}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 3, "character": "Eloy", "credit_id": "52fe46d0c3a36847f8113b11", "gender": 0, "id": 133568, "name": "Leandro Stivelman", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/gcY4U3d5wuCF0Kcr03vaxzlaGV6.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Elvira", "credit_id": "52fe46d0c3a36847f8113b15", "gender": 1, "id": 125493, "name": "Antonella Costa", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/nfKlI4epG9AzHsYMsvbhxbGrOId.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 5, "character": "Padre de Eloy", "credit_id": "53e2bf85c3a36848500011d3", "gender": 2, "id": 228441, "name": "Hugo Arana", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/ay75uNPUTTjgnEHf6UQbvUBfW04.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 6, "character": "Ana", "credit_id": "53e2bf9bc3a36848500011d5", "gender": 1, "id": 267827, "name": "M\u00f3nica Gal\u00e1n", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/umeCH5zEMsKlhccsYXH2FCg6jfF.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe46d0c3a36847f8113b07", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 81116, "job": "Director", "name": "Eliseo Subiela", "profile_path": "/VnJ7QQwEjNrLXC1rJBKXaZwxx8.jpg"}, {"credit_id": "52fe46d0c3a36847f8113b0d", "department": "Writing", "gender": 2, "id": 81116, "job": "Writer", "name": "Eliseo Subiela", "profile_path": "/VnJ7QQwEjNrLXC1rJBKXaZwxx8.jpg"}]}}
