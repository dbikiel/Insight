This semi-documentary slice of life is based on the diaries of Elmore Randall Stewart about her days on the Wyoming frontier in the early 20th century. It's a strongly feminist statement about a woman raising her small daughter alone and scrapping for a living by working for a shy Scottish rancher. Director Richard Pearce brings an endearing touch to a film that is helped greatly by the dazzling cinematography of Fred Murphy. Conchata Ferrell and Rip Torn star in this small film that substitutes veracity for a high-powered plot.", "poster_path": "/nA7cD1uegeo6KZe8lVejthDnq16.jpg", "release_date": "1979-09-22", "title": "Heartland", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.4, "vote_count": 8, "popularity": 3.712}, {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/iSTgfxDZW5KjdJ15AwijNoHAJqq.jpg", "genre_ids": [35], "id": 23270, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Russell Howard: Live", "overview": "Russell has been busy cementing his place as one of the hottest properties in comedy with his BBC6 Music show every Sunday, loads of Mock The Week and Never Mind The Buzzcocks on BBC2, Would I Lie To You? and Live At The Apollo on BBC1, Law of the Playground on Channel 4 and Tough Gig, The Brits and The British Comedy Awards on ITV!
