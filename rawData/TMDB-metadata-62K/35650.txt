Bibiane tries drowning her sorrows in alcohol and drugs, and late one night, after several drinks too many, she hits a jaywalker while driving home. The pedestrian staggers away after the accident, and the next morning, Bibiane remembers what happened and is frightened at the prospect that she may have killed someone. When Bibiane reads a newspaper account the next day of a seafood delivery man who died in his kitchen after being struck by a hit-and-run driver, she's convinced she was responsible for the crime. Guiltily attending the man's funeral, Bibiane strikes up a conversation with his son, Evian, and soon the two have become romantically involved, with Bibiane unable to tell Evian her secret.", "popularity": 4.209, "poster_path": "/ouM7H16aKd3IzvjHNcUmzezI5qq.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 806, "logo_path": "/kcNh09qqR2Pkw1JAzRW4CommrW4.png", "name": "T\u00e9l\u00e9film Canada", "origin_country": "CA"}, {"id": 7828, "logo_path": null, "name": "Max Films Productions", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 9116, "logo_path": "/vYeYdFxDWoqBzFgYz2Tf9d2ZseE.png", "name": "SODEC", "origin_country": "CA"}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CA", "name": "Canada"}], "release_date": "2000-09-08", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 87, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "fr", "name": "Fran\u00e7ais"}, {"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}, {"iso_639_1": "no", "name": "Norsk"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Maelstr\u00f6m", "video": false, "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 52, "keywords": {"keywords": [{"id": 10183, "name": "independent film"}]}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [{"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/kQyeXce1ozYryHichnEserMAByN.jpg", "genre_ids": [28, 80, 18, 53], "id": 11564, "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Class of 1984", "overview": "Andy is a new teacher at a inner city high school that is like nothing he has ever seen before.

Opinions are firmly held and diametrically opposed. There are those who cherish this precious legacy and are worried about our exploitation of it. There are those, in government and industry, who swear that the forest will be preserved for future generations.

In the second movement, Louisette (Marcia Pilote) hides out on a fishing boat and is discovered by a Bulgarian fisherman who treats her with kindness and consideration and they spend a special evening together -- without being able to speak a word in the other's language.
