Just as they are about to leave, word comes that a vicious killer Kane had sent to prison years earlier, is coming to town on the noon train seeking vengeance. Kane attempts to rally the town to fight the gunman, but not even his former deputy Harvey (Diamond) is willing to help. Harvey's cowardice infuriates his girlfriend, Helen (Alonso), whose romantic past with both Kane and with the arriving gunman convinces her to pack up and leave town. As the dreaded noon hour approaches, Kane realizes he must stand alone against the coming storm.", "popularity": 1.939, "poster_path": "/46IIjGAmRkMVqIQudx5c5Q4sIN8.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2000-08-20", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 85, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "High Noon", "video": false, "vote_average": 3.0, "vote_count": 2, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [{"cast_id": 1, "character": "Will Kane", "credit_id": "52fe484e9251416c9108797d", "gender": 2, "id": 4139, "name": "Tom Skerritt", "order": 0, "profile_path": "/m4KNYlzzV5PCpOqBU5x9ydab0aR.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 6, "character": "Harvey", "credit_id": "53073cfb92514133720001da", "gender": 2, "id": 31508, "name": "Reed Diamond", "order": 1, "profile_path": "/mASm3pG5IzLMQlORD8v7vb8oEly.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 2, "character": "Amy", "credit_id": "52fe484e9251416c91087981", "gender": 1, "id": 62547, "name": "Susanna Thompson", "order": 2, "profile_path": "/rqM3mLVmu4ZgXTDmD8nDDmo9SxY.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 4, "character": "Helen", "credit_id": "52fe484e9251416c91087989", "gender": 1, "id": 2051, "name": "Mar\u00eda Conchita Alonso", "order": 3, "profile_path": "/98EEtbFdolcvYiqfM78dybJyyW3.jpg"}, {"cast_id": 7, "character": "Billy", "credit_id": "58e1e419c3a36872af008045", "gender": 2, "id": 80352, "name": "Noel Fisher", "order": 4, "profile_path": "/57rdFE8AZnhWhwH28QXpeXFhUgB.jpg"}], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe484e9251416c9108798f", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 29078, "job": "Director", "name": "Rod Hardy", "profile_path": null}]}}
