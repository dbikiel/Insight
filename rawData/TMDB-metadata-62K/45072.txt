Fearing scandal, the school insists it was suicide. But after discovering from the boy's girlfriend, Carlin, that he was being badly bullied, Abel suspects that a dangerous schoolboy initiation has gone horribly wrong and he secretly solicits the help of a sympathetic teacher, Betsy. He is warned off the investigation by his boss, as the school is a generous benefactor to the Police benevolent fund. Abel, however, cannot let the case go, not only because his own brother committed suicide years before, but also it seems that the spirit of the dead boy is leaving them clues as to what really happened that night.", "popularity": 4.486, "poster_path": "/e86TIdBIIoYAHBLFDZnxlrq8doU.jpg", "production_companies": [{"id": 2267, "logo_path": null, "name": "First Choice Films", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 3753, "logo_path": null, "name": "Kismet Film Company", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 22150, "logo_path": null, "name": "imX Communications", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 738, "logo_path": null, "name": "Myriad Pictures", "origin_country": "US"}, {"id": 1071, "logo_path": null, "name": "Spice Factory", "origin_country": ""}, {"id": 806, "logo_path": "/kcNh09qqR2Pkw1JAzRW4CommrW4.png", "name": "T\u00e9l\u00e9film Canada", "origin_country": "CA"}, {"id": 1727, "logo_path": null, "name": "Movision", "origin_country": ""}], "production_countries": [{"iso_3166_1": "CA", "name": "Canada"}, {"iso_3166_1": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "release_date": "2005-10-21", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 95, "spoken_languages": [{"iso_639_1": "en", "name": "English"}], "status": "Released", "tagline": "It's the truth that haunts us", "title": "The River King", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.8, "vote_count": 32, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [{"id": 37661, "video": false, "vote_count": 7, "vote_average": 5.9, "title": "Icon", "release_date": "2005-01-01", "original_language": "en", "original_title": "Icon", "genre_ids": [28, 18, 53, 10770], "backdrop_path": "/l4jTTx0RUiDUBharJpy41LZxy8N.jpg", "adult": false, "overview": "A former US Operative, who lived in Russia in his earlier years and had been married there with a child, comes out of retirement to face down a former enemy, now running as a candidate for President in modern Russia.
