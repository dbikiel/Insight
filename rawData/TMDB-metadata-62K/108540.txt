Wilson is co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, a man included in TIME Magazine's \"100 Persons of the 20th Century.\" Interviews, recreations, and rare archival material reveal how Bill Wilson, a hopeless drunk near death from his alcoholism, found a way out of his own addiction and then forged a path for countless others to follow. With Bill as its driving force, A.A. grew from a handful of men to a worldwide fellowship of over 2 million men and women - a success that made him an icon within A.A., but also an alcoholic unable to be a member of the very society he had created. A reluctant hero, Bill Wilson lived a life of sacrifice and service, and left a legacy that continues every day, all around the world.", "popularity": 0.675, "poster_path": "/AqFoDRXdsR4anzYMyGaGFn77hjU.jpg", "production_companies": [], "production_countries": [], "release_date": "2012-05-18", "revenue": 0, "runtime": 104, "spoken_languages": [], "status": "Released", "tagline": "", "title": "Bill W.", "video": false, "vote_average": 5.0, "vote_count": 1, "keywords": {"keywords": []}, "similar": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "recommendations": {"page": 1, "results": [], "total_pages": 1, "total_results": 0}, "credits": {"cast": [], "crew": [{"credit_id": "52fe4a9fc3a36847f81d8add", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 1044251, "job": "Director", "name": "Dan Carracino", "profile_path": null}, {"credit_id": "52fe4a9fc3a36847f81d8ae3", "department": "Directing", "gender": 2, "id": 1044252, "job": "Director", "name": "Kevin Hanlon", "profile_path": null}]}}
