Capt. Russ Edwards commands a helicopter rescue unit that fly wounded soldiers out of battle areas and rescue pilots who have to ditch their aircraft. He has a problem with one of his men, former fighter pilot Lt. Pete Stacey, who takes unnecessary risks with his helicopter. Stacey is frustrated at having to fly helicopters pilots instead of jets and wants out. Helicopter pilots are in short supply however meaning he has no chance of being transferred. Under pressure from his squadron commander to reduce the number of helicopters out of commission for repairs, Edwards does his best to get Stacey on side. He eventually comes around.
In the Korean war, the commander of an Air Rescue helicopter team must show a hot-shot former jet pilot how important helicopter rescue work is and turn him into a team player.
