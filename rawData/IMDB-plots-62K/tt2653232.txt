The film is about the backstage life of an ordinary Moscow bar, where the relationship between the owner, the "roof" and the workers is very similar to family. However, unlike the family of these people, a joint affair is connected, the roles in which are far from equivalent. The relationship of submission and oppression permeates the whole life of the characters in this film.
