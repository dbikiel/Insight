It all started with the first wine sip Giovanni Cuttin had in his life. A Marzemino, a wine mentioned by Lorenzo da Ponte in his libretto for Mozart's Don Giovanni. Since then, the shy clerk becomes the bank director, a lady-killer and the most revered wine expert in Italy. But soon he will be charged for his wife's murder. Being grilled by Inspector Sanfelice, Giovanni reflects on the last 3 years of his life, dominated by an only mad passion: wine. Gradually the investigation becomes more and more caught between the boundaries of reality and its dreamlike counterpart. What if Giovanni, like Faust, met a diabolic force that made his life very special, only to settle the score later?
