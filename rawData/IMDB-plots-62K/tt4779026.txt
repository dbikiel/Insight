It's been generations since the Harkers' great-great grandfather killed Count Dracula. Now the Harker brothers and their best friend Ned are a town joke - until a real vampire turns up.
The day that Jonathan Harker slayed Count Dracula was a more important event than most people realize. For it was not just the death of the count, it was the destruction of 'The Master's Power.' Without a master, the entire race lost its ability to turn humans into vampires. For generations, the Harker family has guarded the Master's Skull, the key that would allow a new vampire master to emerge. So effective were the Harkers that now, over a hundred years later, vampires are so scarce that most people do not believe that they even exist. This is unfortunate news for the modern day Harker siblings because they still believe in vampires and that makes them the town embarrassment. But when two dead bodies turn up with strange animal attack marks, the Harkers convince the town that a vampire is on the loose and promise to kill it on stage at their family home. The only problem is, the actor they hired to play the vampire is killed and replaced by an actual vampire who the Harkers mistakenly invite into their home. Once inside it consumes the Master's Skull, gains incredible power and turns the conveniently waiting citizenry into vampires. Now the fate of the world lies in the hands of an unprepared generation of vampire hunters who must overcome their own shortcomings to fulfill their destiny as the heirs of House Harker.
