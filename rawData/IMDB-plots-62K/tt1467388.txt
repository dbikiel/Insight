The life of the doctor André Luiz in the spiritual city of Nosso Lar.
The selfish Dr. André Luiz dies and awakes in a kind of limbo called "Umbral". After a painful and numb period in a gruesome swamp, he is rescued and brought to "Nosso Lar" (meaning "Our Home"), a spiritual city. He finds a place of harmony, where people live in peace, working for the good of humanity, for the self evolution and awaiting for reincarnation. Sooner André Luiz changes his behavior becoming a more self aware and altruist man.
When Andre, a prominent physician and father of three, dies after a long battle with cancer, instead of rising to what he believed would be heaven, he wakes up in a valley of devastation.Living as a castaway and struggling to avoid the "vampire" spirits who attack at night, Andre, as well as the other spirits among him, is deemed to have been a suicide and it is beyond him why he has had such a fate. Then, one day, a beam of light comes down from the sky bringing rescue to spirits in deep troughs of the Valley. Andre is rescued and lifted to a spiritual city named Nosso Lar (Our Home).He makes new friends and alliances but also meets his enemy - himself, he has betrayed his own existence by his self-destructive actions during his life on Earth. In order to prove he still truly values life, Andre must gain merits in the eyes of the City through humbling hard work.One day, he finally receives his greatest wish since arriving at the city, permission to decend to earth and "see" his wife and kids. Ten years have passed, his wife has remarried and his children have grown up.In this awakening moment Andre, will have to put into play what he has learned back in Our Home. He must accept his own death and step into another level of existence, learning forever to love and be loved and that life never ceases.
