A slacker trust-fund type finds the motivation to pick up a job as the coach of middle school soccer team.
To his friends and to his girlfriend Zoe, Nick is stuck in perpetual adolescence: he's approaching 30, lives off a trust fund, has no job and no responsibilities. When Zoe abruptly leaves him and New York for a job in Los Angeles, Nick comes up with a strategy to get her back: taking a job as a soccer coach of a junior-high team. At first it's a diversion - just a strategy. Then, primarily through Hector, the team's best player, Nick engages. In the process, he meets an ER doc who interests him, goes behind Hector's father's back to keep the lad on the team, and realizes he's conflicted when he gets the chance to reconnect with Zoe. Can arrested development give way to maturity?
