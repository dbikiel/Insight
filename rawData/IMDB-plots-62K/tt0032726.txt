Delia Jordan's father is murdered and some very valuable jewelry stolen. She hires Michael Lanyard (aka The Lone Wolf), a retired-and-reformed jewel thief to find the killer and the jewels. He is more than glad to do so, as it is just a matter of time before the police begin to suspect he was the guilty party.
