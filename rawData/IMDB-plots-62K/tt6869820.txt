Everyone knows the "Harrinator". A tough ice-hockey crack, famously witty, irresistible with the ladies, as cool as they come. At least that is what he thinks. Everyone else would disagree. His hockey career has been over for years. His hairline is receding as fast as his gut is growing. And to top it off, his long-time girl-friend Ina kicks him out of their apartment. Harri is in a deep slump.
