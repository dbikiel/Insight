After a car accident, a man has to live the rest of his life with a smile on his face because of the nerve damage.
It's been a week since Willem's horrible car accident, and even though the good news is that he managed to survive, on the other hand, the bad news is that the inoperable nerve damage in his spinal cord has paralysed the muscles responsible for smiling. As a result, Willem must now learn to adapt to a new reality, where a permanent smile glued on his face will follow him for the rest of his life. Thank God, you are alive Willem, after all, it's just a minor disability, isn't it?
