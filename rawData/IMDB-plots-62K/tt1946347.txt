A new hero is born in this hilarious, animated adventure of epic proportions. Timo, a student at the Gladiators' Academy in Rome, has no desire to become a legendary gladiator like his stepfather. That is, until the mesmerizing Lucilla walks into his life. With the help of an unlikely band of sidekicks, Timo is determined to be the gladiator of her dreams and embarks on an action-packed journey to become the Colosseum's first victor.
It is the age of Imperial Rome. Young Timo is an orphan of Pompeii's terrible eruption, adopted by general Chirone and raised in the most famous Gladiators' Academy in Rome. Is this the beginning of a new legend? The legend of a great hero? Not so much! Timo is not exactly gladiator material! He just wants to hang out with his friends, Ciccius and Mauritius, and avoid his stepfather's bizarre training sessions at all costs! However, when Timo meets the lovely Lucilla, he decides to change his life and bring out the valor inside himself - valor that has never shown itself before. Through spells, crazy raids in the woods and the terrible trainings of a very personal lady trainer, Timo has to transform himself into the greatest gladiator of all time. And as they say, if "fortune favors the bold" in Rome hard times are awaiting Timo!
