An epic, sweeping and riveting tale of an impossible love set across two time periods and continents.
Great Barrier Reef, 2020. After a dangerous dive to save his wife Laura trapped while exploring a colonial British merchant ship wreckage, Jay Fennel, a rugged and attractive marine archaeologist lies comatose in a Boston hospital. Fennel's dream-like coma takes us back in time to Pune, India in 1778. The British East India Company is invading the palaces and a young captain named James Stewart, who bears a striking resemblance to Fennel, is about to embark on a dangerous mission. Along the way he encounters murder, deceit, betrayal and revenge. He falls deeply in love with an Indian She-warrior named Tulaja, an impossible love which he must fight for. Only the power of a ring can transcend time and save a life.
