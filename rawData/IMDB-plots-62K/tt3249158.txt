On the desolated coast of Veracruz, Mexico, 17-year-old Sebastián takes over running his uncle's small &amp; cozy rent-by-the-hour motel. There all by himself much of the time, he meets Miranda, a regular customer who comes to the motel to meet a lover who always keeps her waiting. There together with time to kill, Sebastián and Miranda begin to get to know each other, and an ambiguous game of seduction begins between them.
