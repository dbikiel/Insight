Los Angeles is about to be hit by a devastating earthquake, and time is running out to save the city from imminent danger.
An endless string of minor tremors near the already unstable San Andreas Fault threatens to set in motion an unprecedented swarm of earthquakes in bustling Los Angeles when a greedy oil company uses the controversial fracking technique. With his teenage daughter heading straight into the epicentre of the problem, the engineer and fracking operation supervisor, Jack, along with the discredited geologist, Gladstone, and the young USGS scientist, Emily, must come up with an effective countermeasure before a super-earthquake--the dreaded Big One--obliterates the entire city. Can they avert the ultimate geological Armageddon?
