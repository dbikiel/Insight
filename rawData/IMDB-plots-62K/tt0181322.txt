Funny hood movie about a white boy from Ireland who was adopted by a loving, helpful and supportive black family and then was brought up in the predominant black neighborhood and he was the minority. The introduction does great at setting the world and characters up for the easy to follow story that does not require full attention to back able
A Sunday in the life of Derrick King, an Irish kid raised in South Central L.A. by a Black family. He talks Black, dresses Black, and thinks of himself as Black. It's a day of disasters: his mom kicks him out of the house, his uncle fires him, the woman he loves dismisses him as childish, the LAPD (wearing Confederate-flag shoulder patches) impounds his car and tosses him in the drunk tank, a mean dude is after him for money, he's imprisoned in a store basement by gay sadists, and he's shot at. Along the way, however, he shows kindness to a near-sighted kid, and those random acts may prove to be his salvation.
