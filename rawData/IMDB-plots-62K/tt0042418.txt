Porky is a contestant of a sadistic big money radio quiz show hosted by Daffy Duck.
Daffy Duck as a radio quiz-show host, and Porky Pig as his contestant. Daffy penalizes Porky very roughly if he doesn't answer a question properly or within the (ridiculously short) designated time. He: drops safes, boulders and waterfalls on Porky; forces Porky to name all 48 states in a very brief moment of time; locks Porky in with a ravenous gorilla and threatens him.
Warner's cartoon which spoofs radio game shows of the era, particularly "Truth or Consequences." Daffy Duck is the sadistic host of a radio game show, wherein Porky Pig appears as a contestant. Daffy asks ridiculously obscure questions, to which Porky must answer before getting buzzed within a fraction of a second. Porky winds up getting crushed by giant boulders, heavy safes and a torrent of "Niagra Falls" water. Other "T-or-C" elements spoofed included the "Mrs. Hush" contest (Daffy playing a scratched-up record of "Mrs. Shush brushing her teeth on Wednesday") and the reunion (the duck orchestrating a "reunion" between Porky and his "long-lost relative," a ravenous gorilla). Eventually, a banged-up Porky awarded the grand prize of $26 million for "being such a good sport" turns the tables on his tormentor; he purchases the radio station where Daffy is employed and subjects the black mallard to his own medicine.
