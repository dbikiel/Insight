An architect engages in conflict with an activist who lives in a dangerous complex the architect designed.
Architect Leo Waters' marriage is in trouble, his wife Julia unhappy. Their son Martin drops out of college; he's home, adrift and out of sorts with Leo. Daughter Christina has entered her mid-teens with a new body and new feelings. Enter Tonya Neely, a community organizer who lives in high-rise public housing Leo designed years' before. The residents want the projects razed; she comes to Leo asking him to sign her petition. He's put off; Julia supports Tonya. Martin goes to see for himself and begins a friendship with homo-erotic potential. In the meantime, Christina puts herself at risk seeking affirmation. High pitched emotions and high-rise apartments: what will collapse first?
