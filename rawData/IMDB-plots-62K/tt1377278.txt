Intent on shaking up the ultimate 'sacred cow' for Jews, Israeli director Yoav Shamir embarks on a provocative - and at times irreverent - quest to answer the question, "What is anti-Semitism today?" Does it remain a dangerous and immediate threat? Or is it a scare tactic used by right-wing Zionists to discredit their critics? Speaking with an array of people from across the political spectrum (including the head of the Anti-Defamation League and its fiercest critic, author Norman Finkelstein) and traveling to places like Auschwitz (alongside Israeli school kids) and Brooklyn (to explore reports of violence against Jews), Shamir discovers the realities of anti-Semitism today. His findings are shocking, enlightening and - surprisingly - often wryly funny.
Yoav Shamir tries to take a witty &amp; satirical approach to a deadly serious issue - anti-semitism in today's world. His film &amp; title focus almost exclusively on the unprecedented access he was given to Abe Foxman and the NY-Based Anti-Defamation League (ADL). Shamir tries to document one of the ADL-reported cases of rising anti-semitism, and this leads him to Crown Heights in Brooklyn, where he interviews black youth. He accompanies students on a March of the Living visit to Poland. He is invited to join Foxman on an ADL delegation to Europe, where he discovers that the ADL is closely aligned with the policies of the Israeli government. He then interviews two American academics who have written about this issue (Mearsheimer &amp; Walt) and concludes that Israel's past is preventing it from moving forward. This singular focus on the US-Israeli lobby as a lense with which to view contemporary anti-semitism means that Shamir ignores more sinister forms, such as Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
