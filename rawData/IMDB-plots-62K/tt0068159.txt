The Emperor's spy, the daughter of the killed governor Shih Han, a mysterious mercenary and a blind swordsman team up to defeat Chief Pirate, leader of the 72 Desperate Rebels, but eventually it will be his daughter who will decide the end of the movie. This superb martial arts movie has nice imaginative touches and a very good planning direction.
