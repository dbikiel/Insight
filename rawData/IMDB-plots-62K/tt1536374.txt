Rather than push him further, the associate agrees to let him take all the time he needs.

In the meantime, he makes friends of a widower sailor and a world-weary waitress at the marina. Through the slow moving yet beautiful and well played drama in this gorgeous lake setting, viewers come to know how he has reached this point in his life. By the early spring, he is feeling stronger and is ready to face society again. He sells the sailboat, now in excellent condition, and says good-bye to this episode of his life.
