Heart-broken after several affairs, a woman finds herself torn between a Poet and a TV Host.
Jamie Harris is a young woman that works giving original names to different products. She has a promiscuous life, with affairs with "Mr. Wrongs", differently of her sister that has a steady relationship with her boyfriend. Jamie misses her mother, who committed suicide when she was a child, and her father blames himself for the death of his wife. When Jamie dates her former professor John, for whom she had a crush, she believes she found her prince charming. Meanwhile she meets Mick, the host of a TV show, and they become friends. When John ends his relationship with Jamie, she decides to be celibate for three months, and she becomes closer to Mick. After some wrong decisions, Jamie finally commits with her true love.
Making a living giving names to little-known products, Jamie Harris (Marguerite Moreau), single, lonely and jilted several times, meets with John Kalicharan (Naveen Andrews), a Teacher at UCLA, who has just released his 8th book of poems, and both are attracted to each other. Jamie's sister, Laura (Emily Deschanel), who has a steady boyfriend, is happy that her sister has found a soul-mate. But the affair does not last long as John makes it known that he wants to return to his wife, Martha. Heartbroken, she gets depressed, wants to follow in her suicidal mother' footsteps, but decides to remain single and celibate. Then TV Host Mick McCabe (Brian J. O' Bryne) enters her life, and shortly thereafter both decide to live together. Complications arise when John returns to her life - and she finds she is still attracted to him.
Jamie, a sharp-witted, sexy young woman, is a self-described "jerk magnet." She makes a living as a namer - she gives products their identity. But she's very confused about her own. When she finds herself in a love triangle with two seemingly decent men, she struggles to make the right choice.
