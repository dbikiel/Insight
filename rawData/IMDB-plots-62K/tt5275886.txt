A look at the aftermath of the Sandy Hook massacre where 20 children were murdered at their school by a resentful, gun-obsessed shooter, but led to no changes in American federal gun laws.
A drastic rise in mass shootings has ripped across the US in recent years. Despite a growing body count and the chorus of outrage that comes with it, America has failed to respond. The film explores why this is and how the firearms industry's lobbying group, the National Rifle Association, has developed a stranglehold on the politics of the issue. Searing and powerful, Under the Gun ultimately gives a human face to a crisis that is scarring the conscience of a nation.
