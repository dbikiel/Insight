A small child takes small leaps, which progress into huge bounds over buildings, forests and continents.
Animated from the point of view of a small child. The viewer is jumping down a suburban street, and progressive jumps are higher and higher. The viewer/child lands in various city settings, a jungle, a battle field, the depths of Hell, and finally back to the street where the adventure began. The film is notable for the use of perspective in pre-CGI animation.
Through the use of a direct first-person-point-of-view experience, an unseen young child trudging slowly down a stretch of road realises that each step he takes, allows him to bounce and hop longer and higher than the previous one. As a result, at first, the child is able of leaping above small trees and then entire jungles or even towns and oceans, and before long, travel around the globe in a fascinating, yet brief adventure until he lands where it all started: the neighbourhood's empty road.
