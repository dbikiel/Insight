This movie concerns a pacifist husband who is so involved in his "causes" he totally neglects his wife and two sons. The wife, ready to leave her husband, finds the schoolmaster knocking on their door informing them their boys are going to be expelled for fighting, which he finds ironic, in as much as the father is a known pacifist. When they get to the school, their sons have disappeared.
