Sisters Léa and Aurélie, 19 and 13, live in Paris with their mom. They miss their dad, who drowned. Their mom has a new man, Vincent, a cop. The girls are angry, stealing wallets from gymnasium locker rooms and running a con on men Aurélie invites to an empty gym (Léa bursts in, law book in hand, quoting the penal code on statutory rape). Aurélie befriends a runaway, Anne-Sophie, 19, who tells them her dad, who's abandoned her, lives across the street; Léa reluctantly takes her in and designs a series of vengeful pranks that disrupt his life. Things get worse when a victim of their scam has a heart attack. All roads lead back to their dad's death. Can healing happen?
