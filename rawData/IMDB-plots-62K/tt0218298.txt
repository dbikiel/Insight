A wealthy professional gay couple, who wish to adopt children, see their lives turned topsy turvy when they take in two misbehaving brothers, supposedly just for one night.
Social Worker Gloria finds brothers T.J. and Brian, once again, abandoned by their alcoholic mother. With nowhere else to turn, she delivers them to a gay couple (Phil and Eric) on a waiting list to adopt an infant. While 8-year-old Brain is ready to give this new situation a go, 12-year-old T.J. has already been hardened by past rejections to give ANY situation a go. Both boys must either accept this situation or be split up in group homes. After several calls, T.J. gets his drunken mother, Cat, to drop by, and she ends up staying as well. This puts a strain on the gay men's relationship, forcing one to leave while the other remains to fix the problems with the boys and their mother.
Phil, a gay couples counselor, and Eric, a lawyer, are a gay couple anxiously awaiting the opportunity to adopt a baby, but in the meantime they decide to do a favor for their caseworker and take in two very mischievous foster kids "just for one night". One night turns into many and the couple struggles to keep their home and relationship in one piece. When the boys' alcoholic mother turns up to reclaim them, things get even more complicated.
