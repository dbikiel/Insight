An observable, fast-talking party man Darnell Wright, gets his punishment when one of his conquests takes it personally and comes back for revenge in this 'Fatal Attraction'-esque comic thriller.
Darnell Wright has a way with the ladies- both figuratively and literally. Darnell begins to feel like he hit the jackpot when he meets Brandi, who starts off playing hard to get, until she eventually gives in to Darnell's advances. But when Darnell reconnects with Mia, a longtime friend, he begins to form a stable and committed relationship with her. Immediately he tosses not only his other relationships with a few other women, but also tosses his relationship with Brandi. Brandi immediately becomes unstable and starts stalking him. But things get really personal when Brandi starts threatening Mia, forcing Darnell to see the error of his ways and ultimately learning to stop trying to be "the" man and become "a" man.
