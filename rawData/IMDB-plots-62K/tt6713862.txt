Samadhi Part 1 (Maya the Illusion of the Self) is the first installment in a series of films exploring Samadhi. Samadhi is an ancient Sanskrit word which points toward the mystical or transcendent union that is at the root of all spirituality and self inquiry. The saints, sages and awakened beings throughout history have all learned the wisdom of self surrender.
Daniel J. Schmidt, creator of the award-winning documentary Inner Worlds Outer Worlds, has gifted humanity yet again with the long-awaited Samadhi film. Daniel's breathtaking fractal and musical compositions are woven through this comprehensive documentary, which beautifully explores the perennial wisdom and unfathomable truth that is Samadhi; the awakening from the illusion of Maya or identification with an individual "I". This film is a must see for anyone who is interested in journeying beyond the world of self, to our true nature beyond name and form.
