In Los Angeles, a meteor bringing some sort of disease falls on a group of homeless and turns them into flesh eater zombies. Meanwhile, two rival gangs are dealing drugs with an intermediary in an old warehouse without knowing that there is a stake out of the LAPD of the whole operation. When the policemen are ready to arrest the criminals, they are attacked by the hunger zombies in the beginning of a nightmarish night.
When a meteorite containing a zombie-spawning spore crashes in the City of Angels, the survivors of the impact must put aside their differences in order to fend off the flesh-eating masses in this tale of urban apocalypse starring Phantasm's Reggie Bannister. As two rival gangs converge on an empty Los Angeles warehouse, the stage is set for violence and mayhem. But this isn't any ordinary gang fight, because these thugs have an unearthly taste for human flesh. Now, if they have any hope of fending off the advancing horde of the undead, the toughest gangsters in the neighborhood will have to put their differences with the LAPD aside long enough to aim for the head and formulate a solid escape plan. ~ Jason Buchanan, All Movie Guide
