In occupied France during the Franco-Prussian War, a young French laundress shares a coach ride with several of her condescending social superiors. But when a Prussian officer holds the coach over, social standings are leveled and integrity and spirit are put to the test.
In 1870, during the Franco-Prussian war, gorgeous laundress Elisabeth Rousset is returning home in Cleresville in the occupied France with a snobbish and selfish group of aristocrats, businessmen and a young priest in a stagecoach. When they stop in a inn for the night, the arrogant Prussian Lt. von Eyrick, known by his alias Mademoiselle Fifi, decides to break the patriotism of Elisabeth and holds up the stagecoach until Elisabeth agrees to "have dinner" with him in his room. The selfish group forces Elisabeth to meet Mademoiselle Fifi, who humiliates her in his room. When the stagecoach finally departs, only Jean Cornudet and the priest comfort Elisabeth and Cornudet decides to stay in Cleresville to ask for forgiveness to Elisabeth. However she rejects his apologies but he decides to stay in the church to help the young priest to resist the Prussians that want him to ring the church bell. Meanwhile Elisabeth is forced to go to a party with Prussian officers where Mademoiselle Fifi is. What will happen to Elisabeth and Cornudet?
