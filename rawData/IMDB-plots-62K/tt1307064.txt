A pregnant Dr. Annie Watson is going to stay with her best friend, Dr. Belinda Owens while her husband Peter is off on a surveying job. Annie's mother-in-law Mary, a seen-it-all midwife whose homeopathic remedies and folksy wisdom are at odds with Belinda's scientific knowledge, comes along. As Belinda deals with the headaches Mary is causing, she must also address issues at home. While her adopted daughter Lillian, discovers the joys and pains of first love, Belinda and her husband Lee, find their own relationship suffering over Belinda's inability to get pregnant. Just as the town learned to put its faith in Belinda as their doctor, Belinda must learn to accept that the best guidance for her own problems may come from unlikely sources. Annie gives birth to a daughter, Melinda (Lindy), and the movie ends with Mary hopping into a buggy to leave and Belinda whispering something in her ear. When her husband asks what she said, the answer is: "Oh, I just told her that I'll need a midwife soon.
