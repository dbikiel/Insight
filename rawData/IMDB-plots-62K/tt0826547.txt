When a man answers an advertisement to train as a record producer, he's excited by the prospect of signing undiscovered musicians, only to discover his new job isn't all it's cracked up to be.
An audience-pleasing riff on the dirty underbelly of the American Idol phenomenon, GREAT WORLD OF SOUND stars Pat Healy and Kene Holliday as Martin and Clarence, two normal southern guys who get caught up in the excitement of a record industry talent scouting scheme.  Real people performed in the audition scenes without knowing it was actually a film shoot.  With hidden cameras, the interaction was recorded between the lead actors and the unsuspecting musicians.  This documentary-style process was integrated into the final narrative, creating a unique blend of fact and fiction.
