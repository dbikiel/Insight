Have you ever met someone who made your body heat up, get a little nervous and sweaty, and made your crotch stir a bit? Sexual Tension: Volatile will reignite those lustful feelings as it weaves six scintillating experiences of men in various stages of nudity and many forms of erotic male bonding. A pulsating, sexually-charged thrill ride, the film begins as a young man feels the adrenaline rush of his sexy tattooist's needle in "Ari" while in "The Cousin," a geeky, cute boy finds a hot Summer afternoon triggering his taboo desire for his Speedo-clad cousin. Two straight buddies literally show each other how to make love to a woman in "The Other One," while a man with 'Broken Arms' receives a sensual sponge bath from a male nurse. "Love" is questionable when a broken shower brings a married man and a hairy, innkeeper together when they least expect it and in "Workout" two muscular men, 'sexting' pictures to some hot chicks, begin to shed their clothes and inhibitions. Argentinian filmmakers Marcelo MÃ³naco and Marco Berger omnibus film, where sex links each story, offers voyeuristic pleasures as the camera penetrates and caresses the men's bodies, but also turns a sharp eye to the mysterious, taboo and electrifying nature of male intimacy.
