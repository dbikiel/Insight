An artist rescues a mermaid in a sewer; who develops bleeding sores all over her body, paints a portrait with her oozes and eventually disjoints her.
An artist finds and rescues a mermaid in a sewer. He takes her home with him and she develops sores all over her body that begin to pustulate and bleed. He uses what oozes from her sores to paint her portrait. When he can no longer handle it anymore he breaks down and dismembers her body.
Unable to come to terms with the loss of his beloved and recently deceased wife, a grief-stricken artist returns to the sparkling river of his childhood memories--now a vile sewer--in search of inspiration. There, next to a drainage pipe, a generous surprise awaits him, as a trapped mermaid riddled with lumpy carcinomata and grotesque boils begs him, telepathically, to help her. Without delay--having already found the stimulus he was seeking--the compassionate painter brings the contaminated siren home to deal with her grave pathological condition; however, the malignant disease keeps getting worse, spreading all over her body. Now, through the aquatic being's anguish and her nauseous septic fluids, the widowed man can express himself on canvas, documenting the rampant and irrevocable decay. Is there beauty in pain? Can there be salvation in death?
