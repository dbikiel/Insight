A retired teacher and a soap star leave their routines and the men in their lives behind and embark on a weekend trip.
Middle-aged Cleopatra misses her children and is tired of her husband's excuses and drunkenness. She meets Sandra, a young soap star on her way to Hollywood, and to rebel against their seemingly inescapable destinies, they decide to go on the road through the Argentinian countryside. After a vehicle malfunction, they are picked up by Carlos with whom Sandra has an adventure and by twists and turns both women decide to leave their old unsatifying lives behind. Natalia Oreiro is truly charming in this small but pithy film from antipodes.
