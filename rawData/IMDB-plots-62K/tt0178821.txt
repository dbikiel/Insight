A talented all-black high school basketball team challenges the top all-white team in civil-rights-era New Orleans.
An angry black priest in 1960's New Orleans goes against the wishes of his parish leader as he pushes a basketball game between his unbeaten all-black team and an undefeated all-white prep school team.
This is based on the true story of the first integrated basketball game in the history of New Orleans. The plot follows the events leading up to the game between all-black St. Augustine High School and all-white Jesuit High. It focuses on the struggles that Father Joseph Verette had in trying to pull the game off and trying to earn respect for his team.
