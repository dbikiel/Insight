Two brothers' love and loyalty to one another is tested by the code of the streets.
O and Rico may have different mothers but the blood of their father, Raqmaan, a hustler, runs deep in their veins and creates a bond between them that is unbreakable. When one of their associates thinks he's been double crossed by them and becomes a FBI informant the brothers must decide between abiding by the code of the streets or trying to save themselves.
Blood First was created in part to address the vicious cycle of crime, violence and imprisonment plaguing urban landscapes throughout America and around the world. The film chronicles the lives of two brothers who follow their father's footsteps into the dangerous drug trade. Their criminal enterprise is threatened when one of their associates decides to cooperate with a federal investigation forcing the brothers to decide whether to run, fight or cooperate. The film seamlessly weaves the men's past with the present and shows audiences how these men became who they are today.
