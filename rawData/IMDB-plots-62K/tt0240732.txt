In the twinkling of an eye, a mass disappearance has occurred. Moments after the turmoil and confusion, the FBI is called in to investigate and locate the missing persons. For Agent Adam Riley (David White), it is personal. For Agent Charles Baker (Kevin Downes), it doesn't matter, it's just a job. Before long the investigation turns toward a mysterious man (Brad Heller) who seems to be raising up a para-military organization. Does this man hold the key to the truth that the world is searching for?
