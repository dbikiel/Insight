A documentary about a group of disparate people in Israel and the Occupied Territories, all connected by a single catastrophic suicide bomb.
Since the renewed Intifada began in 2000, there have been over 75 Palestinian suicide bombings. This is the story of 0ne-the bombing of bus 32 in Jerusalem in June 2002.
