Muzafar and Feruz are two good-hearted shepherds from Taboulistan... a tiny country in Central Asia that no one has ever heard of. In order to bring his country into the international limelight, the son of the Tabouli president decides to try terror "advertising" and entrusts the two shepherds, more naive than evil, with the mission of a lifetime: destroying the Eiffel Tower! To meet their objective, they have to move through the most hostile territory imaginable: France! A France far different from the West they had heard described: Corsican nationalists, over-zealous policemen, dishonest taxi drivers, violent sports fans, crabby employees, unfriendly waiters, Kafkaesque administrations and medical malpractice... they are spared nothing. Luckily they meet Marianne, a young and pretty reporter who mistakes them for illegal aliens and helps shows them another face of France... a hospitable, magnificent and generous land where the living is easy. Vive la France!
