In a small isolated village, in 1953, a wedding is interrupted by the news about the death of Stalin. Because any public celebration is forbidden, they decide to turn the happy event into a silent wedding.
The enigmatic mayor of a deserted village somewhere in Romania commissions a small film crew specialised in unexplained paranormal phenomena to make a brief documentary on his village, just before the upcoming elections. Pretty soon, their hopes will be fulfilled, as the crew witness strange sightings of women dressed in black lurking in the ruins, and eerie apparitions of a creepy woman in white that send shivers down the spine. What grievous event deserted this once-peaceful and colourful village; moreover, did it have something to do with Stalin's death? But, above all, is the mayor hiding something?
