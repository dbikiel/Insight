The Cuban misadventures of a Florida smuggler, at the time of the Cuban Revolution.
Remake of "To Have and Have Not" based on Hemingway short story. Plot reset to early days of Cuban revolution. A charter boat skipper gets entangled in gunrunning scheme to get money to pay off debts. Sort of a sea-going film noir with bad girl, smarmy villain, and the "innocent" drawn into wrong side of law by circumstances.
During the Cuban Revolution, financially indebted Florida petty smuggler Sam Martin loses his ship to gun smugglers who force him to take a secret shipment to Cuba with the promise to return his boat to him as payment for services rendered.
