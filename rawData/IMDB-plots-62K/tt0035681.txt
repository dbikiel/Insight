The Governor sends Ken and Hoot to clean up the town of Willow Springs. Finding themselves outnumbered by Duke Wade and his gang, Hoot gets the Governor to release some prisoners into their custody. They now have the men they need but one of the prisoners is a double-crosser secretly working for Wade.
The Trail Blazers, federal marshals Ken Maynard and Hoot Gibson, are sent to Willow Springs, where recently their two predecessors were killed trying to bring law and order to the town. Trouble begins when smarmy town boss Duke Wade forces the ranchers to use his toll road to move their cattle to market.
Governor Brighton has sent his two Marshals, Ken Maynard and Hoot Gibson, to clean up the lawless town of Willow Springs, which is run by "Duke" Wade. The latter has rustled his brother Jim's cattle and Jim, in self defense, has killed one of Duke's henchmen - he has more than one. And "Duke" is determined to hang Jim. But Jim escapes with the aid of Ken and Hoot and hides out at the Baxter ranch, home of his sweetheart Mary Baxter. "Duke" sends a couple of henchmen out to capture Ken and Hoot, but they are instead captured by Ken and Hoot, who put them in their own jail. Because they need help and reinforcements, Ken and Hoot have four convicts brought in, on the promise of pardons, to aid them in cleaning up Willow Springs. But one of them, Weasel, tells "Duke" where Jim is hiding. Ken and Hoot manage to get Jim to their jail, and the three and old-timer Eagle-Eye, and the three convicts wage a gun-battle against "Duke" and his henchmen.
