The jurors in a murder trial take their seats in a small, drab room to decide the defendant's fate. At first, all the men vote guilty bar one, who still has many questions not answered in court. Through theories and re-enactments, others change their minds, but one man is adamant that he'll never change his vote and won't listen to reason.
