This hilarious romantic comedy stars the ever-popular Brooke Shields as Charlene, the American wife of Vincenzo, a struggling Italian artist who wants to make a name for himself in New York's cutting-edge art scene. Just one problem: He's already married. When Maria, Vincenzo's Italian wife, crosses the Atlantic with two her kids, she's less than thrilled to find her husband living with the very pregnant Charlene, whose fury matches anything Maria can dish out. The personal and cultural clashes between Vincenzo's two families make for an extremely tense environment, but they soon find themselves united against Paul Parmesan, a self-serving home shopping magnate who tries to exploit both Maria and Charlene while lining his own pockets. Love takes a beating and comes back fighting in this unconventional comedy about a very unconventional family.
