A martial artist joins a hard-hitting gunfighter in the search for treasure while bandits step into their way.
During a hold-up in the Wild West, Dakota kills a rich old Chinese man, Wang. Later, he is captured, sentenced, and is about to be hanged - but he never profited from Wang's death- only finding the photographs of his four widows and a fortune cookie. Meanwhile, Lo comes to America in search of his uncle's fortune after his family is held hostage. He frees Dakota from the Hangman, since he's the only one who can help find Wang's fortune. Now, the difficult part will really start... the Treasure hunt. First they need to locate the four clues, a tattoo on each of Wang's widow's butts, then uncover the fortune while being hunted by a religious fanatic/ ex-confederate soldier who is on to their game.
Intent on pulling off a lucrative heist, the lone thief, Dakota, arrives at the small town of Monterey to rob the legendary fortune of the wealthy Chinese businessman, Mr Wong, out of a special and very strange safe. Instead, the ambitious Dakota finds himself in the town's jail, facing the gallows, only to escape by the skin of his teeth with the aid of an unexpected ally: Mr Wong's nephew and charismatic Kung Fu expert, Ho Chiang. Now, the improbable duo will have to embark on a long journey in the dangerous Far West to find the uncle's treasure; however, the important but cryptic piece of information needed is tattooed on the delightfully curved derri√®res of four beautiful ladies. Will the fastest gunman in the West and the most lethal Kung Fu master in the East unearth the secret of the blood money?
