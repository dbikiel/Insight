The Chipmunks believe that Dave plans to propose to his new girlfriend in Miami.--and dump them. They have three days to get to him and save themselves not only from losing Dave but also from gaining a terrible stepbrother.
Alvin, Simon, Theodore have been living with, and annoying, Dave Seville for about 8 years now. Now they discover that Dave has a girlfriend and worry that he'll dump them for her. To save their relationship with Dave, the Chipmunks must find a way to stop him from proposing.
The (mis)adventures of Alvin, Simon, and Theodore continue with their manager/guardian Dave giving up songwriting to produce, so he can give them a more grounded life--but Alvin and the others love to perform. Dave has a new girlfriend, Samantha, whose son Miles treats them badly. Dave must go to Florida to help one of his artists, and he leaves the Chipmunks behind and takes Samantha. They think Dave plans to propose to her, and fear he'll ditch them. So they, along with Mitch, try to go to Florida to stop the proposal. But they don't have enough money, so the Chipmunks must ride in baggage, but when they're discovered, an air-marshal with a grudge against them decides to do away with them, so they force the plane to land. But they're far from Florida so they must go on foot.
Alvin, Simon, and Theodore, along with the Chipettes-- Brittany, Jeanette, and Eleanor--set up a surprise birthday bash for Dave that also serves as a good-luck party for the Chipettes, who are scheduled to be guest-judges on American Idol. Alvin invites and hires many people and celebrities to Simon's dismay before Dave returns home. The next day he takes them to mini-golf to meet his new girlfriend Samantha. The Chipmunks like her, but her son Miles is a bully who physically abuses them. Later, the Chipmunks find an engagement ring in a bag Dave brought home and believe he'll propose to Samantha, so they try to steal the ring.
