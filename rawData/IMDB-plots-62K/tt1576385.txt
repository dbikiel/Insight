While in Argentina, renowned Mexican muralist David Siqueiros paints the mural "Ejercicio pl√°stico" at the country home of newspaper owner Natalio Botana. Set in the 1930's, this lovely historical reconstruction serves as a testament to the creation of a masterpiece, while depicting the controversial private and public events that shaped its materialization. A complex storyline which includes Argentina history, romance, drama and much more. A story of ethics, infidelity, love and hate around the renowned David Siqueiros, no one is innocent here; everybody shows weakness and values as well, there is no black and white. There are multiple tones, as in a Siqueiros painting.
