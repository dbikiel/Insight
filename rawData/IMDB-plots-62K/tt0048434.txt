The history of Nazi Germany's death camps of the Final Solution and the hellish world of dehumanization and death contained inside.
One of the most vivid depictions of the horrors of Nazi Concentration Camps. Filmed in 1955 at several concentration camps in Poland, the film combines new color and black and white footage with black and white newsreels, footage shot by the victorious allies, and stills, to tell the story not only of the camps, but to portray the horror of man's brutal inhumanity.
Director Alain Resnais' short 1955 documentary is among the very first films dealing with the Holocaust. From the building of the concentration camps to the eventual roundup of Jews and others, the films provides a view of the harsh reality that begins with the Nazi rise to power in 1933. People from across Europe are herded into cattle cars and transported to the camps where those who were not not immediately executed are put to work. By 1942, the Nazi's "final solution" - the extermination of all Jews - is in full force. Little of the camps remain today but the memory of what happened lives on.
