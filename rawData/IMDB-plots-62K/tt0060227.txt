A highly fictionalized filming of the early life of Miguel de Cervantes, author of "Don Quixote".
In this romanticized biography of Spain's most celebrated novelist, young Miguel Cervantes, son of a country doctor, cockily pushes better-bred, court-connected peacock chicks aside for the post of private secretary to monsignor (soon cardinal) Acquaviva, papal envoy to king Philip II of Spain. Realizing his friendship with the Ottoman general-envoy was abused to win time while an avoidable 'crusade' was mounted, Miguel resigns but joins the Holy League's fleet. He and his brother become marked heroes, but get no serious reward and are captured by Algiers pirates for the slave market, yet set aside to bring ransom. Instead, they mount a brave slave revolt.
