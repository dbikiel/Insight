A famous opera singer falls for his sergeant's sister at boot camp.
Famous tenor Renaldo Rossano (Lanza) is one month away from being too old to be drafted but ends up in the Army. His drill Sergeant happens to be one of his biggest fans so he gets preferential treatment. The Captain insists he be treated the same as everyone, and "no more concerts in the barracks." He meets Sergeant Batterson's sister, Bridget, who is beautiful, charming, and a great soprano. He is smitten, but Bridget doesn't think she will "fit into his lifestyle" after he gets out of the Army. Renaldo gets into minor difficulties here and there, but all works out in the end. The movie ends with Renaldo and Bridget singing a duet, the title (Oscar nominated) song "Because You're Mine."
