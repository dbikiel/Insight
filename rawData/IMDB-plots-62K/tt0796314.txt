A Dog's Breakfast is a head smacking, bone breaking, fiancé bashing romp, about a family that just loves themselves to pieces. Patrick has always had a somewhat combative relationship with his little sister Marilyn. But when she brings home her new TV star fiancé Ryan, it's all out war. When Patrick fails to drive a wedge between the happy couple, he reaches for sharper instruments. Every family has a few skeletons in the closet; A Dog's Breakfast is the nightmarishly funny mess Patrick makes when he tries to add another to his.
Writer-director David Hewlett unleashes his hilarious dark side with this imaginative comedy about a family that loves itself to pieces.When Marilyn (Kate Hewlett), a successful make-up artist for a hit TV series, brings home the show's star, Ryan (Paul McGillion), to announce their engagement, it catapults her already obsessive brother Patrick (Hewlett) over the edge. And when Patrick learns that Ryan is out to murder his sister, he plots to give the actor the axe - or something sharper. But Patrick bungles the perfect crime, things spin out of control, and soon, the family's sanity has gone to the dogs.
