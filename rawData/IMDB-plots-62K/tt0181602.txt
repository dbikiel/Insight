Four convicts become embroiled in what seems like an easy way to get a million dollars. Enlisted to pick up a sealed box and guard it for one day, the four men let their curiosity take over and decide to look at its contents.
Four felons are contacted by an anonymous client via the internet. They are instructed to go to a remote desert island and pick up an "item" and keep it safe for 24 hours. It will then be picked up and they will be paid. However, upon getting it back to their apartment, their curiosity gets the better of them and they decide to investigate their package. They discover that they have a telepathic worm connected to a life support system. The film then disintegrates into a slasher film as one by one the protectors are killed in grisly fashion.
