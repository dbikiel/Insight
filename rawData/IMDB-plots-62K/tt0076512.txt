Susan St. James helps Peter Fonda, an ex-convict who goes after the country music star who stole his song and made it a hit.
Upon his imminent parole after serving six years in Huntsville Prison, Bobby Ogden hopes to carve out a career as a country music singer/songwriter. The prison's associate warden believes Bobby has what it takes if he only gets the opportunity. With country music star Garland Dupree performing for the prisoners, the associate warden, as one of those opportunities, has Bobby perform one of his songs, Outlaw Blues, for Garland, even if it's only for the concert's sound check, hoping that Garland will help Bobby out when he's paroled. While Garland seems disinterested in Bobby's performance, he actually was listening carefully as the world eventually not only hears Garland perform Outlaw Blues on the radio, but he has copyrighted the song claiming it as his own work. Once released, Bobby has to decide what to do about Garland stealing his song, knowing largely that it's his word and that of a bunch of other convicts against that of a renowned country music star. What happens between Bobby and Garland is affected by one of Garland's backup singers, Tina Waters, who was at the sound check and who believes her ingenuity should be able to reap her some financial benefit, and by Austin Chief of Police Buzz Cavenaugh, a personal friend of Garland's, Buzz who has to deal with the situation as it is ruining his chances in his run for Austin mayor.
