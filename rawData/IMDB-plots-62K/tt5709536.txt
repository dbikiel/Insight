An Inuk filmmaker takes a close look at the central role of seal hunting in the lives of the Inuit, the importance of the revenue they earn from sales of seal skins, and the negative impact that international campaigns against the seal hunt have had on their lives.
Seal hunting, a critical part of Inuit life, has been controversial for a long time. Now, a new generation of Inuit, armed with social media and their own sense of humour and justice, are challenging the anti-sealing groups and bringing their own voices into the conversation. Director Alethea Arnaquq-Baril joins her fellow Inuit activists as they challenge outdated perceptions of Inuit and present themselves to the world as a modern people in dire need of a sustainable economy.
In her award-winning documentary, director Alethea Arnaquq-Baril (Inuk) takes on misconceptions of commercial seal hunting, introducing us to the individual Inuit hunters and communities fighting to retain their ancestral rights and earn a living in today's international monetary economy, by focusing on her own relatives, friends, and community.
