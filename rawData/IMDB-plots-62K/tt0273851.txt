A modern story, inspired by King Lear, set in contemporary Liverpool.
A powerful dynasty, headed by a charismatic, manipulative father, falls when he decides to hand over his criminal empire to his three corrupt and power-hungry daughters. Kath runs a brothel down by the docks, Tracy owns a soccer team and Jo, a former junkie--and prostitute--rejects her inheritance, pitting sisters Kath and Tracy against each other.
