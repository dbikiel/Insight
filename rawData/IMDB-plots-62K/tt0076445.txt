In the Catholic and traditionalist Italy, two teen-agers covertly discover new prohibited games
In 1948, Ju, an awake seven-year-old boy, grew up in a complicated family. The father, traumatized by the war, frustrated by a job that does not earn much and his wife's constant complaints about the squalid conditions in which they are forced to live. He violently rages on his wife and children Ju and Pa. The sexual curiosities of the small but precocious Ju are fueled by the attendance of a sentimentally unhappy teacher and above all by the arrival of the beautiful and lively adolescent cousin Nene, who elects him as confidant of her relationship with young mulatto Rodi, who lives nearby, among the stragglers.
