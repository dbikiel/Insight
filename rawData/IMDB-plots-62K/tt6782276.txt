It tells the story of the Padre (Roth), a small-time con man on the run from his dogged pursuers, U.S. Court Justice Nemes (Nolte) and local police officer Gaspar (Guzm√°n). When the Padre is caught mid-con, he flees the scene in a stolen car, unaware that a precocious 16-year-old girl, Lena (Henriquez), is stowing away in the back seat. After she blackmails him into letting her join his journey, the duo plan their biggest heist yet - not always aware of the dangers of working with each other and the law closing in on them.
American retired Judge Randall Nemes and his hired gun, Gaspar, track down a con man posing as a priest in a small Colombian town only to be thrown off-course by a scrappy 16-year-old girl intent on reuniting with her sister in the United States.
