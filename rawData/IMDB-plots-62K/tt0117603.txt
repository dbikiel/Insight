Desperation drives four inner-city women to bank robbery in Los Angeles, then they start mistrusting each other.
Four Black women, all of whom have suffered for lack of money and at the hands of the majority, undertake to rob banks. While initially successful, a policeman who was involved in shooting one of the women's brothers is on their trail. As the women add to the loot, their tastes and interests begin to change and their suspicions of each other increase on the way to a climactic robbery.
Lida 'Stony' Newsom, Cleopatra 'Cleo' Sims, Francesca 'Frankie' Sutton and Tisean 'T.T.' Williams are four female inner city Southern Californian childhood friends. Now adults, "Set It Off" focuses on life's series of unfortunate events and taking vengeance on life with an Uzi in hand. They embark on a series of robberies in the Southern California banking district to fund their escape from a life surrounded by tragedy, poverty and despair. That triggers an over diligent Detective Strode and his female partner, Detective Waller, on a hunt for the "armed and dangerous" women. That triggers another series of unfortunate that corners Lida 'Stony' Newsom into choosing between her new found love interest and friends.
