Ellie O'Brien (List) is trying to juggle rhythmic gymnastics and troubles with her best friend. Meanwhile, classmate Jack Malloy (Bertrand) is struggling to live up to his brothers' hockey-star legacies and his dad's high expectations and tough-love approach. During a text argument about whose life is easier, Ellie and Jack trigger an inexplicable real-life swap. As each tries to navigate the other's life, hilarity ensues when Ellie (as Jack) learns about brotherly bonding and hockey lingo, while Jack (as Ellie) has to decipher girl code and experiences a spa day. With a rhythmic gymnastics championship and a spot on the varsity hockey team on the line, they must figure out how to get back in their own bodies before the swap becomes permanent. As they are forced to literally walk in each other's shoes, they gain empathy for one another and learn valuable lessons about their own lives.
The film is about two teens who swap lives and become each other. Ellie O'Brien has to deal with the tough-as- nails brothers and an army tough dad. Jake Malloy has to deal with a mean former best friend and girl troubles.
