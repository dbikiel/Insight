One last job separates the leader of the Ravens gang from an early retirement. When he finds his girlfriend beaten to death by members of a rival gang, he seeks revenge, knowing that he may be dead by dawn. Will more blood bring her back?
After one too many encounters with The Spiders (a rival gang), The Ravens' leader's girlfriend tells him to quit the gang or it's Splitsville. He does so, but the leader of The Spiders is hellbent on revenge and arranges the murder of the girlfriend. That ticks off the boyfriend, who wreaks havoc with the two gangs, who have joined forces in order to pull off a security truck heist.
Determined to get her boyfriend, Goose--the leader of the dangerous Ravens gang--out of the streets before it's too late, his worried psychic girlfriend, Christy, gives him an urgent ultimatum. Instead, Goose decides to do one last but lucrative job before settling down with her, only to find Christy brutally beaten to death in her apartment by unhinged members of the rival gang, the Spiders. Now, Goose seeks revenge, knowing that he may be dead by dawn. Will more blood bring back the dead?
