A young gay man tries to balance his career as a personal assistant while searching for love.
Twenty-six year old gay Ethan Green has a number of good friends such as his currently single lesbian roommate Charlotte, but has never been able to maintain a long term romantic relationship, he who ultimately breaks it off with whoever he is dating if that significant other has not already broken it off with him. He ultimately discovers that he is largely to blame, as every guy who has broken it off with him felt forced to do so in some unspoken pressure by him. As such, Ethan begins to wonder if his Mr. Right is one of his exes who is still in his life for one reason or another. They include: Kyle Underhill, a formerly married pro baseball player who came out because of him and is still in his life solely as the one with who he seemed destined to be; Juarez, who still lives with Ethan's wedding planner mother, Harper Green, as arguably each other's current best friend; LGBT bookstore owner Leo Worth, in whose house Ethan and Charlotte currently live, the house which Leo bought as what was supposed to be his and Ethan's love nest; and nineteen year old sexually aggressive Punch Epstein, whose lesbian friend, Sunny Deal, Ethan has convinced Leo to try to sell the house as arguably the worst real estate agent in Ethan truly not wanting to leave the house. Even if Ethan discovers that one of these men is his true love, it may take more than just that discovery for a happily ever after for the two of them.
Ethan Green (Daniel Letterle) has no problem finding guys who want to sleep with him or even date him, but finding someone to settle down with is a different story. Given three choices -- a sexy teenager, a hunky jock, or his ex-boyfriend who is about to get married -- will he find a Mr. Right, or is he destined to an unfabulous existence. Based on a popular gay-themed comic strip
