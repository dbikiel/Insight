Young prince meets a talking frog who turns out to be a beautiful but cursed princess. To remove the curse, he must go on a quest to find and outsmart the forest witch Baba Yaga.
The king wanted to marry his sons, called them and ordered: take the arrow, go into a clean field, pull the bowstring and shoot, where whose arrow falls - there is his bride. The arrow of the eldest son was raised by the hawthorn, the arrow of the middle son by the merchant's daughter. The arrow of the youngest son Ivan Tsarevich fell into the swamp, and so his fate is to marry the Princess Frog.
