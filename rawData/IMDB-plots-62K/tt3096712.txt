A young woman who works at cosmetic company becomes the prime suspect after her beautiful co-worker is murdered.
When a senior employee, who is considered the most attractive among her colleagues, at a cosmetics manufacturer is murdered suspicion falls on her junior coworker whom many describe as plain and unremarkable. Following a good-bye party at work the junior employee is seen running towards the train station before she drops out of sight. It is an open-and-shut case as far as the news reports and online commentators are concerned.
