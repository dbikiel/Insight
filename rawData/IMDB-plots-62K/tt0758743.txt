Four guys set off on a world tour to enact the seven deadly sins. Based on the MTV Europe series "Dirty Sanchez".
The Welsh nutters, Dirty Sanchez are making a movie: The concept of the film is that the Devil has heard about the dare-devil nature of the Sanchez boys so he's set them the ultimate challenge, to complete stunts based on the 7 Deadly Sins or be damned to the gutter forever. In order to regain their status as hard-asses and crawl out of the gutter - the 7 deadly sins they must complete in seven exotic locations are: Sloth - UK &gt;&gt; Anger - Moscow Russia &gt;&gt; Lust - Bangkok Thailand &gt;&gt; Envy - Ko Phi Phi Thailand &gt;&gt; Pride - Tokyo Japan &gt;&gt; Gluttony - Mexico &gt;&gt; Greed - Dominican Republic And most interesting of all the film-makers have secured Lemmy to play the Devil and do the music. Lemmy: "If they (Dirty Sanchez boys) think they're tough... Wait till they meet me."
