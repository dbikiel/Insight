A platoon of special ops are tasked to parachute into the remote Burmese jungle and destroy a strategic Japanese radar station, but getting out isn't as easy.
A group of men parachute into Japanese-occupied Burma with a dangerous and important mission: to locate and blow up a radar station. They accomplish this well enough, but when they try to rendezvous at an old air-strip to be taken back to their base, they find Japanese waiting for them, and they must make a long, difficult walk back through enemy-occupied jungle.
In 1944, Capt. Charlie Nelson leads a platoon of paratroopers into Burma to blow up a Japanese radar station in advance of the allied invasion. They're accompanied on the mission by Mark William, an American journalist who is there to write about their exploits. The mission goes off without a hitch and without the loss of any men. The plan was for them to be picked up by two transport airplanes at an old landing strip but a Japanese patrol prevents them from doing so. The men are now forced to march towards the front lines, however the closer they get, the greater the number of Japanese troops they will face. With the Air Corps dropping them supplies at agreed locations, the men move on but few of them remain after encounters with the enemy. Eventually, they are all presumed lost just as the invasion is launched.
