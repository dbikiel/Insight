At the closing of 1874 a haunted, dying Wild Bill Hickok teams up with a grieving Crazy Horse to hunt a murderous albino buffalo.
Tormented by incessant and recurring nightmares of a hellish great white buffalo attacking him in the snow-clad wilderness, the ailing Wild Bill Hickok, decides to travel north to hunt down the raging mythical beast. Along the way, the experienced hunter will team up with an old friend, the one-eyed Charlie, while in the meantime, the Indian Chief Crazy Horse whose child was killed by the same creature, is already out in the unforgiving landscape, pursuing the extraordinary bison. Without a doubt, both men won't rest until they find the supernatural monster of legend, however, in this uncomfortable alliance, even the slightest mistake can prove deadly.
In this strange western version of JAWS, Wild Bill Hickok hunts a white buffalo he has seen in a dream. Hickok moves through a variety of uniquely authentic western locations - dim, filthy, makeshift taverns; freezing, slaughterhouse-like frontier towns and beautifully desolate high country - before improbably teaming up with a young Indian named Crazy Horse to pursue the creature.
