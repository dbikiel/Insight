A minute-by-minute account of the Boxing Day 2004 Tsunami told through amateur video footage of people who were there.
The Boxing Day Tsunami was the most devastating natural disaster in recorded history - almost 230,000 people were killed. And as the catastrophe unfolded, remarkable amateur video footage emerged. It was shot by people from all around the vast impact area and depicted the terror and chaos they experienced as the massive waves struck land. Now that footage will be collated into one film: a minute-by-minute account of the devastation, told by the people who were there. We will trace the disaster's terrible seven-hour timeline and massive geographic range, from the initial undersea earthquake, to the sweeping arc of destruction around the Indian Ocean, and the immediate and tragic aftermath.
