A reservation goes awry when two renters one with a dog and one with a cat must share a house.
Spencer is a cat person. Lara is a dog person. Spencer is headed to a beach town to work on his thesis. Lara is coming to the same beach town to escape the shambles of her life. Their personalities couldn't be more different, but when a reservation screw up lands them - and their pets - in the same vacation rental house, they all have to figure out how to get along with each other.
