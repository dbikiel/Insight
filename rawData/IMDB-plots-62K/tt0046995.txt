Peter Stirling (with his old friend the talking mule) is recalled to active duty...in the WACs!
On arrival at Fort Chase, ex-soldier Peter Stirling, recalled to active duty, is re-united with his old pal Francis the Talking Mule. Gradually, it dawns on Peter that a clerical error has assigned him to an all-female WAC base, where broad slapstick is the order of the day and Francis has more horse sense than any of the human officers. Too innocent to appreciate the pleasant aspects of his predicament, Peter ends by helping the "enemy" in a war-game battle of the sexes.
The title name of "Francis" is not referring to a woman or a man. It's a talking mule. He and his pal, Peter Stirling, are victims of one of those frequent military mistakes. Because of a clerical error, Francis and Peter (a male) are sent to a female unit.
