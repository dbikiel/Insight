It's a summer of fun for two teenaged boys who spend their time chasing two sisters, annoying a biker gang, and basically getting into typical sophomoric hijinks whenever they can.
Do kids today think of anything but cruising around, playing games and "making out"? Not the kids from this suburban town who decide to live it up when school lets out. Chief cruisers are Greg and his buddy, Steve. Their targets? Two bouncy, fun-loving sisters, Donna and Suzy. Their hang-outs? "O.J.'s Drive-In," where the gang meets to eat, and "Pete's Arcade." A cast of colorful characters includes: Bert and his gang of punk bikers; Whimpy-"Pete's" inept fix-it man; Sally-an appetizing waitress...how far she goes nobody knows; the town flasher, who risks catching pneumonia every chance he gets, and two cops who spend all their time keeping up with the local "loonies." Anything and everything goes!
