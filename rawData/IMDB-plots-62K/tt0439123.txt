Raised by the same woman, the dark-complexioned, Asmar, and the flaxen-haired, Azur, set out on a quest to a strange and magical land to liberate the enchanting Djinn-fairy; but, only one can save her. Will the brothers be triumphant?
Once upon a time there were two children nursed by same woman. Azur, a blonde, blue-eyed son of a noblewoman and Asmar, the dark skinned and dark-eyed child of the nurse. As kids, they fought and loved each other as brothers do. As grown ups, they mercilessly become rivals in the quest years later, when Azur is being haunted by memories of the legendary Djinn-fairy, and takes it upon himself to journey all the way to Asmar's homeland to seek it out. Now reunited, he finds that she has since become a successful merchant, while Asmar is now a member of the royal guard. However, Asmar also longs to find the Djinn-fairy, and only one of the two youths can be successful in their quest.
Raised by the same woman, Asmar, the dark-complexioned and black-eyed boy, shares his mother and generous wet-nurse, JÃ©nane, with Azur, the flaxen-haired and blue-eyed orphan--two almost brothers that a cruel fate would separate them. Now a grown-up adult obsessed with his nanny's exciting story of the elusive Djinn-fairy, Azur sets out to the edge of the world in the land across the sea to fulfil his destiny, unbeknownst to him, however, that Asmar is alive. In this strange and magical land, two nearly blood-brothers are on the same quest to liberate the enchanting Queen of the sprites; nevertheless, only one can save her. Will the brothers with their unswerving loyalty be triumphant?
Azure is a blond boy with blue eyes, Asmar has dark hair and dark eyes. As kids, they fought and loved each other as brothers do. As grown ups, they mercilessly become rival in the quest for the djinn's fairy, in a medieval Maghreb, full of dangers, magic spells and wonders
