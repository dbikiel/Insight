In "Complaints &amp; Grievances," George Carlin's 12th HBO comedy special, taped at the Beacon Theater in New York on November 17, 2001 (ten weeks after 9/11), Carlin casts his usual jaundiced eye on America and its inhabitants.From the events of 9/11, to the Ten Commandments, to why you should never stop if you run someone over with your car, nothing is sacred to this 45-year veteran of the comedy scene. Self-help books, answering machines, gun nuts, visors, motivational seminars, pictures of children, singers with one name, hot air balloons and guys named Todd; take your pick. They all come in for a special, closer Carlin look in this latest hilarious collection.
