Lucy has always used food to escape life's problems, but when this self-titled "fat friend" lures her group of old college buddies to the Montana wilderness, she reveals a new self - skinny, beautiful and still flawed.
Former college chums gather for what they think is their fat friend's dying last days, but they instead find her celebrating the last few days before reaching her target weight loss at a mountain lodge with a subsequent hiking trip planned for them all. Though it's the woman's long-held dream journey that she wanted to take with her best friends, the others, largely, can't get over the feeling of being duped, with everyone's emotional baggage breaking out awkwardly all along their forced and uncomfortable three-day hike back to civilization.
A previously fat woman named Lucy loses weight after years of being
obese all throughout high school and college, she gets a gastric bypass surgery and becomes a hot version of her fat self. She invites her group of mentally dysfunctional friends from high school to nowhere Montana to
go on a hike to lose her last 4 pounds of her "old self". on this journey they
go through changes and start to show their true colors and their darkest secrets, including a gay friend, two unstable marriages and a friend with a small penis. it takes a horrific crash for them to all finally accept themselves
and each other.
