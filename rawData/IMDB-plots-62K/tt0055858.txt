When a woman is killed in a park, the police bring in everyone suspected of being there when the incident occurred and question them. One of them is the killer.
Near the Tiber river, in a Roman park, a prostitute was killed. The police tracks down people that were inside the park during that night. They are questioned and have to explain why they were there. One of them is the killer.
Under a broad bridge on the ill-lit banks of Rome's silent Tiber River, a hapless prostitute lies dead. Six prime suspects and their distinctly different stories become inextricably intertwined, as an impoverished purse-snatcher; a suave former thief; two friends and penniless Casanovas; an impulsive young soldier, and a mysterious man in clogs tell their versions of what happened that fateful night near the quiet Paolino Park. Now, amid a heterogeneous group of potential killers, who all have something to hide, only one man is capable of such a hideous crime. Will he get away with murder so easily?
