When the latest heir to the Baskerville estate seems to be threatened by a family curse, only the master detective, Sherlock Holmes, can find out the truth.
Sir Charles Baskerville dies on the moor under mysterious circumstances and rumors abound about a demonic hound. When the American heir arrives to take charge, a family friend calls in Holmes and Watson to get to the heart of the mystery.
Dr. Mortimer asks Sherlock Holmes to help protect Sir [not Charles] Henry Baskerville, who has returned to England to take his place at the family seat following the death of his uncle, Sir Charles Baskerville. Sir Charles died of cardiac exhaustion and Dr. Mortimer believes he was frightened to death. There appears to be a curse on the family dating back nearly 200 years to when Sir Hugo Baskerville was supposedly killed on the moor by a huge hound. Holmes dismisses the supernatural elements of the case but there are a sufficient number of odd events to pique his interest. It is apparent that Sir Charles is being followed and one of his shoes was stolen at his hotel. At the family estate, the servants have suddenly resigned and the lady cook is crying herself to sleep every night. Holmes soon realizes that someone is making sure the legend becomes real.
