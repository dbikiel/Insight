A chemist carries out a bizarre experiment with his own head.
After years of research and experimentation, a visionary scientist has finally found the way to inflate living organisms and body parts, so he uses his own head for one last test. Excited with the results and his unexpected discovery, he invites his faithful assistant to share his triumph and witness firsthand the amazing transformation, however, the enthralled helper's carelessness will have an unavoidable conclusion.
A chemist in his laboratory places upon a table his own head, alive; then fixing upon his head a rubber tube with a pair of bellows, he begins to blow with all his might. Immediately the head increases in size and continues to enlarge until it becomes truly colossal while making faces. The chemist, fearing to burst it, opens a cock in the tube. The head immediately contracts and resumes its original size. He then calls his assistant and informs him of his discovery. The assistant, wishing to experiment for himself, seizes the bellows and blows into the head with all his might, and then the head swells, and swells, and swells.
