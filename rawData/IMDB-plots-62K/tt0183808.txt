A con-artist hires two low-lifes to cover him during a deal, ending with three criminals, two dueling pistols, and one night they'll never forget.
The stranger Jack arrives in the studio of the crook collector of antiques Max and tells his ambitious companion and specialist in poisons Jamie that he is Jack's brother. Jamie does not buy his story, dominates Jack and ties him up to a chair. When Max arrives, Jack proposes US$ 100,000.00 for each one to protect him in a negotiation of the antiques "Spanish Judges" with a wealthy and dangerous collector. Max invites his stupid acquaintance Piece, who comes with his retarded girlfriend that believes she is from Mars, to compose the backup team. However, Jack double-crosses the collector and then he intrigues Jack, Jamie and Piece.
Five psychos in search of money. A fast-talking guy named Jack shows up unannounced in Jamie and Max's warehouse apartment where they have antiques, engage in illegal activity, and need money. He promises $100,000 apiece if they'll be his backup during a million-dollar deal that night. They get their murderous pal Piece, his spacey girlfriend, some manikins, and agree. Whenever he's alone with either Max or Jamie, Jack plays on their emotions: pitching woo to Jamie and paranoia to Max. Is Jack telling the whole story or is more afoot: revenge for a beating he sustained, a plot to keep all the cash, or something else involving the dueling pistols he says he wants to sell?
