The film tells the story of two very popular Finnish singer/songwriters: Tapio Rautavaara (Tapio Liinoja) and Repe Helismaa (Martti Suosalo), who worked together until their relationship got frictious for a long time. The film covers the years from 1949 to 1965 (Helismaa's death). Since the film is based on real-life persons it also tells much about the change in Finland during those years and of course much about Finnish popular music.
