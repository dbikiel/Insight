A clairvoyant impulsively marries a butcher, moves to New York City and has a positive impact on the people she meets, changing their futures...which in turn changes hers.
A clairvoyant thinks she's met her husband to be because she's seen him in her dreams. They marry quickly, and return to the husband's ("the butcher"), home in the city. She has a big impact on everyone she meets by anticipating their questions and actions and advising them on their love life. Her interference then brings her into contact with the real man of her dreams.
