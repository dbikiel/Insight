Storekeeper Paul Manning is attempting to sabotage the completion of a telegraph line so he can have time to dispose of his stock before the near-by Army post is abandoned. He uses outlaw leader Roberts and his gang in this effort. Troubleshooter Tim Holt and his pal Chito Rafferty investigate, but quickly get onto the wrong side of Terry Muldoon, daughter of the telegraph line contractor.
