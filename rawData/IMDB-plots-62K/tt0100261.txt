Scientists poison the water supply of a small town, turning the residents into homicidal maniacs who kill each other and anybody who passes through.
One day a helicopter lands somewhere near a small American town and a white-costumed man puts a strange fluid in the town's aqueduct. After a few hours, the first men who drank the poisoned water start to act like mindless beasts and the killings begin. Someone must find what is happening here, otherwise everyone will go crazy or get killed.
