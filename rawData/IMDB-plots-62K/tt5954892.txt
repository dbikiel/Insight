How long is an eternity? A few years or just a breaking of the waves at the rugged Baltic coast? Andreas and Martin share all the ups and downs of life, and their son is maturing. A cautious approach to the traces of a long relationship.
A small quiet place in Thuringia. Andreas' (42) workshop is running well again and Martin (43) is not as much on the road as before. Son Max (19) is out of the house. Finally, the two have more time for themselves and travel in November to the Baltic Sea - as they have always done it before. But Martin is dissatisfied: the weather is bad and he would have preferred to stay at home. Andreas tears off his clothes and throws himself into the cold sea. Full of care, Martin tries to pull him back and swallows the salty water as he stumbles. Back in their holiday home the mood is disturbed by the different expectations. A cautious approach to the traces of a long relationship. Paths tells the love of two people. Not how they got together, not a period that they live through, but their day-to-day-life: all the years between the first kiss and now.
