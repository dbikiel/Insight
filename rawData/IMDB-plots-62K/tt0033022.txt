Oliver suffers a nervous breakdown as a result of working in a horn factory, but when he follows doctor's orders about sea air, he finds an ex-con is aboard.
After working in the noisy horn factory, just the sound of one drives Oliver into a violent fit. Dr. Finlayson prescribes a long, restful sea voyage, so Stan and Oliver rent a boat and set sail, unaware that escaped killer Nick Grainger has stowed away onboard. To disable the crook, the boys prepare him a meal using string for spaghetti, sponges for meatballs and soap for cheese. But Grainger discovers their plan and decides to make them eat the stuff themselves.
An ambulance races through town. It stops in front of the Sharp and Pierce horn manufacturing company and a man is brought out on a stretcher, honking a horn and giggling insanely; the factory owner explains to a policeman that the G-minor-toned horn commonly causes his workers to lose their minds.In the factory, the owner turns down his hearing aid and steps into the horn testing room. At one table, he finds employees Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy hard at work. Calling for silence in the cacaphonous room, he asks Oliver to change the tone of the insane man's horn to a G-minor. Ollie begins work on the horn but soon becomes frustrated with the din of honking and asks Stan how he can work in the racket. Stan tells him the noise doesn't bother him. After a few more moments Ollie becomes fully agitated, tipping over the worktable and yelling. His boss tells him to go home and get some rest. Stan accompanies his friend.At their apartment, the pair call a doctor to examine Ollie. While they wait, they are tortured by maintenance problems in their apartment, such as water coming from the wrong faucet or the doorbell flying off the wall and striking Ollie.
