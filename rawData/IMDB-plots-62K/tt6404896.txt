An animated series centering on the adventures of supernatural detective John Constantine.
A decade after a tragic mistake, family man Chas and occult investigator John Constantine (voiced by Matt Ryan) set out to cure Chas's daughter Trish from a mysterious supernatural coma. With the help of the mysterious Nightmare Nurse, the influential Queen of Angels, and brutal Aztec God Mictlantecuhtli, the pair just might have a chance at outsmarting the demon Beroul to save Trish's soul. In a world of shadows and dark magic, not everything is what it seems, and there's always a price to pay. The path to redemption is never easy, and if Constantine is to succeed, he must navigate through the dark urban underbelly of Los Angeles, outwit the most cunning spawns of hell, and come face to face with arch-nemesis Nergal - all while battling his own inner demons!
