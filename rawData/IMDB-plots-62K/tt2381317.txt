When a super cyclone threatens the entire American western seaboard, a lone meteorologist and a petroleum engineer must battle the elements to stop the threat.
An oil rig accidentally drills into an underwater volcano, unleashing an unstoppable tornado! Indeed, the tornado gets so powerful that it picks up Navy cutters like tinker toys. Then it makes the sky rain oil, then fire. And somehow the oil rig does not get scooped up like Wizard of Oz... somehow. Additionally, the big tornado seems to hover in just one spot for almost the whole movie! Don't ask too many science questions. You won't get answers as to how the sky can catch on fire. You won't get answers about ships weighing hundreds of tons can get catapulted into the air. You won't get answers as to what nanotubes have to with bad weather. And you certainly won't get answers as to how an 18" drill bit can create... a Super Cyclone!
