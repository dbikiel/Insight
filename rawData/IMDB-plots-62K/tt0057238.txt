A juvenile delinquent gets out of the pen and immediately embarks on a rampage of untethered anger, most of it directed at the girlfriend of the journalist who helped send him up. The Warped Ones sounded a lost generation's cry for help and was one of the films that kicked off Japan's cinematic sixties with a bang.
Driven by the pounding beat of jazz music, Akira and Yuki are partners in carrying out their primarily petty crimes, which focus largely on bilking unsuspecting western male tourists through some sort of theft, with Yuki acting as the bait, the party girl hooker. Beyond the other crimes he commits, Akira also steals cars to sell to chop shops. They are eventually caught in the act of a crime, as the police are tipped off to their activities by a beat reporter, Kashiwagi. As soon as they are both out of prison, Akira and Yuki continue their crime spree with a third, Masaru, who Akira met in prison and who has as a self-absorbed mentality as his two new cohorts. Masuru and Yuki embark on sexual relationship, which leads to them mapping out their future. In addition, the three seize upon an opportunity for revenge when they spot Kashiwagi and his girlfriend, Fumiko, an art student. The encounter the three criminals have with Kashiwagi and Fumiko results not only in Kashiwagi and Fumiko's relationship being fundamentally changed, but also Fumiko's need to get involved most specifically with Akira. But Fumiko finds that once in her life, Akira is hard to get out, unless some drastic measures are taken.
