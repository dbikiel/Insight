In the pre-Civil War South, a plantation owner dies and leaves all his possessions, including his slaves, to his young son. While the deceased treated his slaves decently, his corrupt executor abuses them unmercifully, beating them without provocation, and he is planning to sell off the father'e estate--including the slaves--at the earliest opportunity so he and his mistress can steal the money and move to France. The young boy doesn't want to sell his father's estate or break up an of the slave families, and he has to find someone to help him thwart the crooked executor's plans.
It is fantasy-time on the luxurious Bayou Lovelle Plantation in old Louisiana in the days prior to the American Civil War, as the slaves work in a paradise under the generous 'Ol' Massa' Timothy Reid, and they sing "The Lawd sho shakes hands wid dis ground." However, Reid dies, and his crooked executor has plans to beth Reid's son out of his inheritance.
