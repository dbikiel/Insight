A New York City oil company troubleshooter is brought to a remote B.C. lake to look for some lost machinery. Cancelling a trip to Disney World with his son, he decides to bring the boy along. They both end up experiencing more excitement than Mickey could ever conjure in Orlando, when they meet up with bad guys and a legendary creature.
A young boy is devastated when the planned vacation with his father is cancelled due to an emergency salvage mission at a remote Canadian lake. But when he discovers the lake is known as the home of a mythical creature, Mac makes it his mission prove there's more to the myth than just legend. Forging a connection with the creature is easier for Mac than getting his father's attention until both man and beast need all the help they can get.
