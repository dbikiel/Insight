Four childhood friends, all married with no passion left, get together in a high school reunion dinner. Between laughs and drinks, they all agree that they love their wives but no longer desire them. Together they hatch an illogical project: a secret club for men who want to cheat, so that they themselves can regain lust for their wives.
