The life and times of Armando Feroci, a fortyish year old, who's been everything (jobwise), a divorced husband, a careless father, an unreliable brother. The story is told in flashback by his friends while Armando has been mysteriously kidnapped in an Arab country by an integralist group and condemned to death.
