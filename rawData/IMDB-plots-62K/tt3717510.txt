One winter, a pastor finds an abandoned infant on his church steps, and builds 'a drop box' to rescue any others.
The Drop Box tells the story of South Korean pastor Lee Jong-rak and his heroic efforts to embrace and protect the most vulnerable members of society. It is an exploration of the physical, emotional and financial toll associated with providing refuge to orphans that would otherwise be abandoned on the streets. The movie is also a story of hope - a reminder that every human life is sacred and worthy of love. South Korea is not the only country grappling with the issue of orphan care. Around the world, there are more than 150 million orphans waiting for forever families to call their own.
The Drop Box is a 2015 documentary film directed by Brian Ivie about a pastor in South Korea who provides a refuge to orphans who would otherwise be abandoned.
