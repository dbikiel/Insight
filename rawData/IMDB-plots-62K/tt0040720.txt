A widowed farmer takes an indentured servant as his new wife, but the arrival of his old friend threatens their burgeoning relationship.
David Harvey is a widower with a young son, Davey. They live on an isolated Ohio farm during the pioneer days. He wants his son to be raised in the manner his wife would have wanted - with proper schooling, Bible study and proper manners. Rachel, an indentured servant, is sold to David. David then marries her in order that little Davey would have a mother to properly raise him. David shows no real affection towards Rachel since this is a marriage of convenience. This all changes when Jim, a friend of the family comes for a visit. During his stay, David sees that there is more to Rachel than just being a "bonds woman", especially when Jim takes a liking to her. This awakens new feelings in David for Rachel.
David Harvey is a widower with a young son who decides that he needs a woman around the house to cook, clean and teach his son basic schooling. He consults the preacher at the nearest settlement who recommends that Rachel, a bonded servant would make a suitable wife. Harvey is a decent man and he treats Rachel well, but far more as a servant than a wife. When his smooth-talking friend Jim Fairways arrives and shows an obvious interest in Rachel, he starts to realize that she means far more to him than he thought.
