A motley crew of treasure hunters plan to rob the cruise-liner RMS Queen Mary, using a recovered WW2 German submarine.
A group of adventurers refloat a WWII German submarine and prepare to use it to pull a very large heist; The Queen Mary which they plan to rob on the high seas.
When treasure hunters in the Caribbean come across a sunken U-Boat they also find that it was scuttled by its captain and is more or less intact. Eric Lauffnauer is a former World War II U-Boat captain and American Mark Brittain served on subs in the Pacific. Lauffner proposes they give up their treasure hunt and instead turn to piracy - in a few days time the RMS Queen Mary will be in the area with millions of dollars of cash, gold and jewels in its strong room.
The former Navy military and friends Mark Brittain and Linc Langley are hired by the treasure hunters Vic Rossiter, Rosa Lucchesi and Eric Lauffnauer to dive seeking a sank boat with a treasure. Mark finds a World War II German submarine instead and they decide to recover the submarine to heist the Queen Mary. The mechanic Tony Moreno joins the team and they use the submarine that is partially sailing to lure the Captain of the Queen Mary to steal the safe.
