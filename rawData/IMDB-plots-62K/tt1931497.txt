'The bottom line is, there shouldn't be nuclear in our world'. On his 91st birthday, Tsutomu Yamaguchi said when asked about current nuclear power. He is a survivor of not one, but two atomic blasts at both Hiroshima and Nagasaki. While he has no physical scars from the attacks, his emotional scars run deep, as he lost his sons and his wife from the after-effects. The picture of the human 'Jigoku' (Hell) burned in the memory, he realized his experience 'needs to reach out to the world.' His quiet, but powerful words did just that, as the United Nations and Filmmaker James Cameron were moved by his message. The Documentary, 'Twice Bombed,' chronicles Yamaguchi's passionate plea for peace and serves as a reminder of the very human side of an issue facing the world at large.
