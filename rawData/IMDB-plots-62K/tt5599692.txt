Set entirely in an 8m police truck, a number of detainees from different political and social backgrounds are brought together by their inevitable fate, during the turmoil that followed the ousting of former president Morsi from power.
In 2011, after Hosni Mubarak's 30-year presidency, ends an era of authoritarianism with the Egyptian Revolution, however, only a few years later in 2013, in post-revolution Egypt, chaos, tensions and turmoil still boil over throughout the land. During such a day of violent protest, the confined space of an Egyptian Police van is filled little by little with an antagonistic assortment of journalists and opposing demonstrators, both pro-military supporters and members of the Muslim Brotherhood. Suddenly, within the claustrophobic interior of the police van, a microcosmic reality and a cross-cut slice of the modern Egyptian society emerges. Outside the van, civil tumult rages on, but within its steel walls, there is a war in progress. To survive, inevitably, the detainees must put their differences aside, nevertheless, are they willing to do so?
