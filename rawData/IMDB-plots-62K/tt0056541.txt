Drifter Chance Wayne returns to his hometown after many years of trying to make it in the movies. Arriving with him is a faded film star he picked up along the way, Alexandra Del Lago. While trying to get her help to make a screen test, he also finds the time to meet his former girlfriend Heavenly, the daughter of the local politician Tom 'Boss' Finley, who more or less forced him to leave the town many years ago.
After unsuccessfully trying his luck in Hollywood, charming gigolo Chance Wayne wanders back to his hometown, accompanied by Alexandra Del Lago, a movie star on the wane. Chance quickly falls back into his old rut -- he's still smitten with his former sweetheart, Heavenly Finley, but her thuggish brother and her crooked politician father both hate him. When Alexandra leaves town, Chance is left with little more than trouble.
Self-professed to be from the wrong side of the tracks from St. Cloud, Florida, Chance Wayne loves Heavenly Finley, the daughter of wealthy 'Boss' Thomas J. Finley, a corrupt and ruthless politician who rules the town. Thomas does whatever he needs to to break the two up, and manages to run Chance out of town. An aspiring actor, Chance rolls back into St. Cloud with temperamental and drunken Alexandra Del Lago, a once great movie actress whose star has since faded. Picking her up at a party, Chance sees Alexandra as his professional meal ticket. Chance is back in St. Cloud to try and get back together with Heavenly, who still loves Chance but will not cross her powerful father if only to save Chance. Boss wants to run Chance out of town again, but it will be a little more difficult this time if only because of the notoriety of Miss Del Lago. The fortunes of all involved may hinge on some secret information concerning Chance and Heavenly.
