The classic cartoon spies, Boris and Natasha, get their very own live-action adventure. Sent to America to find an important microchip, the usually villainous duo begin to question who they're working for and why.
Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale are still spies for the mean little country of Pottsylvania, where, sandwiched between the nations Wrestlemania and Yoursovania, the Cold War is still frigid. Their Fearless Leader hatches a plan to capture a time-reverse micro-chip, using the two spies as high-profile patsies. They clumsily defect to America and try to unravel F.L.'s master plan. But can these dim-witted fools survive a secret assassin, exploding potatoes and the temptations of capitalism? And what of their old foes, "Moosk unt Squoirrel"?
The cartoon world has ever seen are now actually...real characters, as fearless leader orders Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale off to the United states where they experience the American way of life, high-fashion fame for Natasha, treacherous double agents, ruthless killers, exploding potatoes, and a mysterious man with terrible taste in shoes. They find themselves knee-deep in a secret assassin operation, topped with exploding potatoes and the temptations of capitalism.
