Bobby Dorfman (Jesse Eisenberg) is the youngest son of a Jewish family in New York City in the 1930s; his elder sister Evelyn is a married school teacher, while his elder brother Ben is a gangster. Discontented with working for his father, a jeweler, Bobby decides to move to Hollywood, where he takes a job running menial errands for his uncle Phil (Steve Carell), a powerhouse talent agent..
It's the 1930s. From a middle class Bronx Jewish family, Bobby Dorfman and his transformation from these humble roots to being ensconced within the caf√© society of the leisure class is shown specifically in two situations. The first is in Hollywood, where he is sent by his parents to work for his maternal Uncle Phil Stern, a powerful talent agent who he doesn't really know. Despite the difficulties in even meeting with Phil, Bobby eventually gets hired as his Joe Friday, doing whatever menial work Phil needs accomplished. But through this work, Phil exposes Bobby to the Hollywood parties where deals are made over cocktails next to the pool. Although enjoying the high life, Bobby likes to think himself above the name-dropping vacuousness of Hollywood. The second is back in New York City when Bobby starts working in the high class nightclub owned and operated by his older brother, Ben Dorfman. Although known, the Dorfmans don't generally acknowledge that Ben is really a gangster, who isn't averse to giving anyone crossing him proverbial cement shoes never to be seen again. Through these situations, Bobby's relationships with two different women named Veronica are also shown, one, more casually known as Vonnie, Uncle Phil's secretary who Bobby would consider the love of his life. A union between Bobby and Vonnie has the obstacle of she being in a relationship with a married man, who is a little closer to Bobby than he imagined when Vonnie first mentions him.

Bobby and Veronica date, and she becomes pregnant, leading them to get married at city hall. At one point, he accidentally calls her Vonnie (since Vonnie's full name is also Veronica).Evelyn and Leonard have issues with their neighbor Joe (Brendan Burke), a very nasty individual that constantly causes distress to the couple. Apparently, Joe has threatened to shoot Evelyn's dog, and since she knows he's a security guard, she figures he most likely has a gun that he's ready to use. Fearing for the safety of her and her family, Evelyn asks Ben to have a talk with Joe. Ben and his pals kidnap Joe, shoot him, then bury him under cement as well.Bobby is taken by surprise when Phil and Vonnie, now married, visit New York and attend the nightclub.
