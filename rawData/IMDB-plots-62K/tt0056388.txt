The US cut usually features only 3 segments. The first segment "Death and the Woodcutter" about a common organ grinder (street performer who plays mechanical musical instrument called street organ on the street for a living) who is driven to the edge of sanity by bureaucracy was cut from the US release for its serious tone. The second story "The Crow and the Fox" is about a jealous husband who keeps his wife under lock and key since he lives in a town full of single men. Their neighbor is determined however to service the missus. The third story "The Tortoise and the Hare" follows a jealous wife who decides to win her adulterous husband back. The final tale "Two Pigeons" is about a young man and woman who accidentally lock themselves up in a flat and end up falling for each other.
