While in Turin for the opening and managing of a branch of a fashion salon from Roma, the elegant Clelia finds the young Rosetta Savone near death on the next room of her hotel after taking an overdose of sleeping pills trying to commit suicide. Clelia, who is alone in her hometown Turin, befriends Rosetta and her wealthy friends Momina De Stefani, who is separated from her husband and easily replaces lovers; Nene, a talented artist in ascension in her career married to the frustrated painter Lorenzo that envies the success of his wife; and the futile Mariella. Meanwhile, Clelia feels attracted by Carlo, the assistant of the salon's architect Cesare Pedoni, but he belongs to the working class living in a different social reality. When Momina and Clelia discover that the reason why Rosetta tried to commit suicide is because she felt in love for Lorenzo, the cynical Momina encourages Rosetta to stay with Lorenzo with tragic consequences.
