Kroft, a legendary vampire, returns from sleep. Kroft attacks a couple in a graveyard, raping the woman. The child born feeds only on blood from his mother's breast.
In the 17th C, Charles and Sarah Croyden were vampires hunted by the Church of England. In 1846, Sarah Croyden was burned as a vampire in Salem, Mass. In the late 1930's, Caleb Croft [Michael Pataki], murderer and rapist, was accidentally electrocuted in Boston. Three years later he rises from his grave.Based on the idea that Croyden and Croft are the same 'man', the movie opens in the graveyard where Croft awakens, kills a college student, and rapes the girlfriend. She gives birth to baby James Eastman who prefers blood to human milk. Some 30 years later, James [William Smith] attempts to avenge Mom by seeking out his vampire father who has now become Adrian Lockwood, college professor of mythology. A few night classes, seances, and cold murders later, son exposes father and stakes him with a table leg through the heart. At this moment, son cuts his vampire teeth, and the movie ends with "The End--or is it?"
