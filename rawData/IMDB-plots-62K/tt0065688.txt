Emiliano Zapata was a peasant who understood the ideals of the working class. He became a figurehead of the revolutionary uprising in Mexico and his life as a leader, his wife and the battles of those who fight alongside him are portrayed. He lead an ongoing battle to redistribute lands to the peasants and fought against the powerful and oppressing regime of Porfirio Diaz.
The film centres on the life of Emiliano Zapata, a Mexican peasant farmer who, under the counsel of a friend and teacher, leads an uprising of peasant farmers against Mexicos powerful dictator Porfirio Díaz, to the aid of Francisco Madero, a revolutionary leader. Throughout the film, we encounter his love interest, Señorita Josefa who later becomes his wife. After Zapatas initial rebellion, Madero comes to realise that his own desire for a peaceful transition to power opposes that of Zapatas more violent and hostile approach. After the initial disagreement, Zapata continues his rebellion as his support grows. General Victoriano Huerta, the commanding chief of the Federal Army, becomes impatient to the sympathies of Madero, who has appointed himself president, and so leads the federal troops against him. After a number of battles, Madero is assassinated and Huerta becomes the new president. Zapata and his troops are still hopeful and he agrees to a meeting with federal leaders. This meeting, however, is not to take place and by walking into a trap Zapata has ultimately sealed his own demise.
