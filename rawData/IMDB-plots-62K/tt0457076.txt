Karina has 2 dreams: to become an actress &amp; to see the world. Antonio is in love with her. He promises to bring the world to "Nordestina", a village in the sticks of Brazil. This backwater village has 2 population groups: those who are leaving, and those who are thinking about leaving. Antonio leaves in what appears to be a suicide crusade - openly promising on TV that he will give his Karina all she could wish for, or he'll face a deadly machine he has invented. To challenge fate, he also declares that he'll travel into the future. The day he has to make good on his promises, all "Nordestina" is there, expecting Antonio to realize his promises.
In Nordestina, a village in the middle of nowhere in Pernambuco, Antônio is the youngest son of his mother, who had uninterruptedly cried for five years. When he is a young man, he falls in love for Karina, a seventeen years old teenager that dreams to see the world and becomes an actress. Antônio promises Karina to bring the world to Nordestina, and once in Rio de Janeiro, he participates of a sensationalist television show and promises to travel to the fifty years ahead in the future or die for love with a deadly machine he had invented. Fifty years later, Antônio tries to fix what was wrong in his travel.
