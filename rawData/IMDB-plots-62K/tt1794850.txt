The gang is back, leaving Paris' fading Sentier district for the thriving suburb of Aubervilliers, where they must share the market with Chinese wholesalers. All's well until they fall victim to the local Mafioso's scheme.
The gang is back in this third installment, and they've left Paris' fading Sentier textile district, deciding to set up shop in the thriving suburb of Aubervilliers. However, the old Jewish entrepreneurs who once controlled the textile game in this area have given up their hold to young, dynamic Chinese wholesalers who aren't so eager to share the market. Nonetheless, all adjust to their new setting and find their place and pleasure, willingly settling into routine until things go awry; Simon, a local Mafioso, has malicious plans landing them in trouble with customs, and the group's cohesion compromised. Even so, they rally together and form a plan of their own, teaming up with the Chinese to exact revenge.
