Fatima lives on her own with two daughters to support: 15-year old Souad, a teenager in revolt, and 18-year old Nesrine, who is starting medical school. Fatima speaks French poorly and is constantly frustrated by her daily interactions with her daughters. Her pride and joy, they are also a source of worry. To ensure the best possible future for them, she works odd hours as a cleaning woman. One day, she takes a fall on the stairs. On leave, Fatima begins to write to her daughters in Arabic that which she has never been able to express in French.
Fatima leaves her Moroccan village for the first time at the age of 20, to set out with her husband in France. Twenty years later, she is divorced and has to clean households to support her girls and herself. Until one day, her body quits... unless it's her mind.
