Faces of Death VI is a direct-to-video compilation of the highlights of the earlier films in the Faces of Death series. It features many of the same scenes shown in Faces of Death 1 and 4, as well as the earlier compilation Faces of Death V. It begins without any opening credits, before recycling (for the third time) the sequence from Faces of Death involving the killing of a monkey which is then prepared and served to patrons of a gourmet restaurant, also shown for the second time is the staged heart ripping scene by African natives and the "head in a box" scene, both taken from Faces of Death IV. John Alan Schwartz's cameo as the leader of the flesh eating cult, as well as "The encapsulation of Samuel Berkowitz", are also featured again, and the final credits are those from Faces of Death.
