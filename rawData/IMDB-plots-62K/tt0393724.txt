Sethurama Iyer and the CBI re-open an old case upon hearing from a death-row criminal that he didn't commit one of the seven murders he was convicted of.
Sethurama Iyer, the CBI Officer, comes to Kerala once again. But this time he is on vacation, spending his time with his sister and family. He has a visitor there, Fr. Gomez, who comes from Isow Alex, a convict awaiting his execution at the central jail. Upon Fr. gomez's request, Iyer visits Isow Alex, where he confesses that he had done six out of seven murders which was charged on him. He didn't do the last one. Now Iyer has to start the investigation before it is too late for CBI to correct the mistake. He starts investigating the case in his usual style.
Isow Alex is a convict who has been awarded death sentence for murdering 7 people. But Alex has a wish to speak to Sethurama Iyer before his is hanged. He tells Sethurama Iyer that of the seven murders that were imposed upon him, one (which supplied the strongest evidence against him) was not committed by him and he wants Sethurama Iyer to find the murderer as his last wish. Sethurama Iyer then begins his investigation which ultimately leads to dark secrets that one would never have imagined.
