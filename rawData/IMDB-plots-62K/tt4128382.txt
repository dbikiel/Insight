Two women are abducted by a group of snuff filmmakers and brought into a Hellish nightmare of unmistakable brutality, viciousness and destruction that will leave every viewer shocked, amazed and awestruck.
As the unsuspecting young women, Erika and Amy, get in their car, a sadistic predator in black equipped with a gas-mask knocks them out and abducts them. From this point on, an endless nightmare of unspeakable torment awaits the helpless victims--who are drugged and chained down by their throats to wooden tables--through a wide assortment of sharp instruments and common household tools. Always starting from left to right, the butchering begins, as a savage trio of desensitized executioners film the abominable act of sacrifice with their Super-8 camera. Is death the only means of salvation?
DEATH!
