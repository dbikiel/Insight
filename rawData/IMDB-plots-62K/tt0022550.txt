A prostitute's self-loathing makes her reluctant to marry an idealistic soldier during World War I.
In World War I London, Myra is an American out of work chorus girl making ends meet by picking up men on Waterloo Bridge. During a Zeppelin air raid she meets Roy, a naive young American who enlisted in the Canadian army. They fall for each other, and he tricks Myra into visiting his family who live in a country estate outside London, where his step-father is a retired British Major. However Myra is reluctant to continue the relationship with Roy, because she has not told him about her past.
At the beginning of the film, American Myra Deauville is working as a chorus girl on the London stage. The film jumps ahead two years to find Myra working as a streetwalker, along with her friend Kitty, who lives next door. Myra is having trouble paying her bills, and is behind on her rent to her landlady Mrs. Hobley. Roy Cronin, a Canadian soldier, falls in love with Myra, whom he meets during a German bombing raid on Waterloo Bridge during WW I. Roy does not know about Myra's current profession. Thinking she is still working as a chorus girl on the stage, he proposes to her, and takes her to meet his mother, sister, and step-father. Myra confesses her past to Roy's mother, and decides she cannot marry him due to their differences in social situations. She flees Roy's home and tries to avoid seeing Roy again. He comes to her apartment, finds out her true profession from her landlady, and pays her back rent, plus two weeks in advance. Roy finds Myra on the bridge again, and presses her to accept his marriage proposal as he returns to the front, but minutes later she is killed by a German bomb. Remade in 1940 with Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor.
