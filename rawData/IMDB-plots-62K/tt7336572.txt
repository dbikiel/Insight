A soldier-turned-high school teacher uses unusual methods to reach to a class of poor students, while dealing with a greedy entrepreneur and his gang of fighters as well as the government.
A high school is in crisis, the students are under-performing and preoccupied with non-academic activities. Henry Chen, aka Big Brother, a teacher with rather rusty writing skills yet armed with the most knowledgeable fists and heart of steel, comes to enlighten and inspire the students with his unconventional teaching methods. Just as the kids are improving their work and enjoying the merits of the educational system, trouble follows. An opportunistic entrepreneur creates havoc by sending in a motley gang of fighters to win over the land. Their approach, however, isn't all that persuasive with Chen as he and his beloved class are going to give the unwelcome guests the benefits of a real education.
An ex-military kung fu master Chan sir attempts to resolve school problems using a blend of charisma, honesty, humors, wit and kong fu. The second high school of Hong Kong is doomed by bad students with domestic issues, spiteful gangster and silly bureaucrats.
