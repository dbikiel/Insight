Public school teacher John Hunter and his students participate in an educational exercise that he created entitled the World Peace Game. This interactive experience triggers a transformation of the students from children of a neighborhood school to citizens of the world. The World Peace Game exposes children to the complex issues of the greater geo-political world that they will one day encounter.
