Fontaine (Dame Joan Collins) is the London wife of Benjamin (Walter Gotell), a wealthy Arab businessman. She spends his money on her nightclub, "The Hobo", and partying. She hires a handsome manager, Tony (Oliver Tobias), to run her club, but it is understood that his job security is dependent on his satisfying her nymphomaniacal demands. Soon he loses interest in her, as she treats him like a plaything, and turns his attention to her young stepdaughter Alexandra (Emma Jacobs), who uses him to get back at Fontaine after she discovers their video tape having sex in their private elevator, essentially cheating on her father.
