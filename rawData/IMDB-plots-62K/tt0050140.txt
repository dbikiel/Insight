On a train to Rome, the American singer Marc Revere meets the Italian Raffaela. He notices that she intends to work and live at her uncle's. When he gives her a ride, it turns out that said uncle has moved to South America. So Revere offers her to live with him at his cousin's, an impecunious pianist.
