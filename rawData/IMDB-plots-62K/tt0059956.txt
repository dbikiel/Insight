Somewhere in Central America in 1907: Maria II is the daughter of an Irish terrorist. After her father's death, she meets Maria I, a singer in a circus. She decides to stay with the circus, and on her debut as a singer, she unintentionally invents the strip-tease and makes the circus famous. Then they accidentally meet a socialist revolutionary and find themselves leading a revolution against the dictator, the capitalists and the Church.
The former Irish terrorist, Maria II, joins the vaudeville act of the French singer, Maria I, in Central America in 1907. During their first performance on stage they invent - by accident - the strip tease and become local stars. When they come across a local rebellion, Maria I falls in love with the leader, Flores. When he is mortally wounded, she promises him to continue the revolution against the military, the capitalists, and the Church.
