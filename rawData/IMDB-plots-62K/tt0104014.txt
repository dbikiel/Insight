A happily married 24-year-old woman who experiences an inexplicable, rather restless craving to finally live her life intensely, retells her extra-marital escapades to her husband intending to spice up their marriage.
For a while now, beautiful 24-year-old Diana Bruni who's been happily married for five years, has been feeling distressed, experiencing an inexplicable, rather restless craving to finally live her life to the full and to break free from what society forbids. As this urge grows stronger by the day, Diana will ultimately yield to her carnal longings, and through a parade of particularly explicit nocturnal sensual adventures, she will utterly embrace passion, even if this comes by way of transgression. However, before long, the unaware husband, Paolo, will find all about his headstrong and disobedient wife's extra-marital escapades, raunchy experiences vividly retold by Diana's very lips, with the intention to rekindle their love and spice up their sexual life. Inevitably, poor Paolo disgraced, enraged and green with jealousy (or could it be envy?), will threaten to move out leaving for good his liberated and adulterous wife who seems to feel no contrition at all. But how can Diana make Paolo understand her sincere motive to attract his attention when all she ever wanted was to add a dash of spice in their marriage?
Diana is happily married to Paolo but due to her wild passion for sex, she regularly winds up in short lived erotic adventures, which she doesn't keep hidden from Paolo. On the contrary: by telling him, their sexual relationship is fueled with fresh impulses. When Diana experiences a stormy affair with the poet Alphonse, Paolo gets jealous after all and rejects Diana, who then goes head first in to a wild orgy of sexual excess with her sister and some friends.
