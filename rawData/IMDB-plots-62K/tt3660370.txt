An aging nightclub hostess decides to settle down and get married.
Angélique is sixty. But she is not old. The best proof is that she is still working as a taxi girl in a cabaret by the French-German border. And that her love for men is intact. And that she keeps loving partying. And that there is nothing for her like night life... Of course clients are becoming rarer and rarer. Sure a few of them are offensive to her and treat her like meat... But what a surprise when Michel, a friendly retired miner, asks her to marry him! Will she be able to become a respected married lady? Will she manage to make it up with her family? Can she really say farewell to her present lifestyle?
Still loving to party and still enjoying the company of men, the sexagenarian bar hostess, Angélique, offers drinks and cocktails at a cheap cabaret near the French-German border to make ends meet. However, business is slow--and as the clients become rarer--the ageing seducer begins to realise that, sooner or later, the party will be over. And then, unexpectedly, one of Angélique's regular customers--the kind mineworker, Michel--summons up the courage to propose. However, Angélique has lived nearly all her life working in noisy late-night clubs. Is she prepared to give up her former fast life to be a traditional housewife?
