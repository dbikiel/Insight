The film celebrates the 100th anniversary of the birth of cinema. It presents the technical and artistic evolution of the motion pictures. We move from mute to sound, from black-and-white to color, through various genres and styles. All the aspects are taken into consideration: the historical context, the fashion, the star system and the unhappy ending to watching films in movie theaters.
