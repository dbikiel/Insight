Internationally acclaimed novelist Paul Auster ("New York Trilogy", "The Book of Illusions", "Man in the Dark") explores the art of writing in the darkly comical THE INNER LIFE OF MARTIN FROST. Having completed his fourth novel, Martin Frost accepts the invitation of friends to spend a few weeks in their vacant country house. On his first morning there, he awakes to find the beautiful and mysterious Claire Martin lying next to him. Intrigued by her presence, Martin finds himself compelled to write a new story. But as he progresses, he realises that his and Claire's fate are bound up in the tale he is telling. Employing the wit and intelligence of his literary work, and featuring excellent performances by David Thewlis (THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PYJAMAS), IrÃ¨ne Jacob (THREE COLOURS: RED) and Michael Imperioli (THE SOPRANOS), Auster's third film is both an intriguing mystery and a fascinating portrait of an artist and his muse.
