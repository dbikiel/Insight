The touching love story of a woman (who was left by her husband with three children and went to the city to look for the "meaning of life") and a local militia officer - a person who is positive in all respects. He managed to melt the heart of a woman and return her faith in love. Just the hope for a new life and family happiness has appeared, but an unprofitable husband returns to the village.
