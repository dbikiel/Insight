A lawyer impulsively marries a stranger after his fiancée dumps him.
When his fiancée Valentine dumps him, prominent lawyer Geoffrey Sherwood goes on a bender and winds up married to a stranger, Miriam Brady. They decide to give their marriage a chance. Their landlady, a one-time Floradora girl, offers to help Miriam become refined. Successful again, Geoffrey is approached ("if only we were free") by Valentine. Miriam tells Valentine off in no uncertain terms. Geoffrey moves into his club where Valentine's husband tells him he is a fool to leave Miriam.
The New York society wedding of Valentine French and John Marland results in lawyer Geoffrey Sherwood, the man Valentine dumped for Marland, consoling himself on an extended bender that is certain to send him to the grave unless something changes. That something, or more precisely someone, is garment factory working girl Miriam Brady, the two who meet by chance. Out of circumstance, Miriam, partly as a favor to his friends Hugh Brown and Tony Hewlett, inserts herself into Geoff's life in the short term to make sure that he indeed does not kill himself while on this bender. Having a few too many, Geoff and Miriam end up getting married. In the sober light of day, they decide to give their marriage a chance. It is already facing challenges in they coming from two different worlds, with their landlady Agnes Martin, a Floradora girl in her younger days, trying to help Miriam become accustomed to upper class society. The question becomes whether their marriage can withstand the return of Valentine, who wants Geoff back, he never the one who rejected her.
