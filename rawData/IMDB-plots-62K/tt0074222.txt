The cast of a horror film go out for dinner with their director one night and they all exchange horror stories.
This horror anthology contains four spooky tales of the supernatural told around the dinner table by the actors and the director of a horror movie. The stories involve a mad bomber who gets his macabre comeuppance; a magical coin that transports its owner back in time; a ghost haunting a rich old man's vault; a karate champion whose desire to achieve the "Tenth Level" reveals a secret for which he isn't prepared and finally the framing story ties everything up with a creepy climax.
