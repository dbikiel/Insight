An adult-oriented version of what would eventually become an award-winning children's classic. This version of the show features Pee-wee's playhouse and many of the characters of the later series, but with adult and sexual overtones and jokes including "mirror shoes" and others.
This live stage version adds a dose of mildly adult double-entendre to the format familiar later as the children's TV show "Pee-Wee's Playhouse." Pee-Wee (Paul Reubens), in his fantastical odd-angles playhouse, is visited by puppet characters and cartoonish human friends, who conduct satirical 'educational' skits such as "Pen Pals From Around The World" with Mailman Mike (John Moody), a risque hypnosis of a female audience volunteer (Joan Leizman), and a one-guitar salute to Sly Stone hits by Mr. and Mrs. Jelly Donut (Brian Seff and Monica Ganas). Between the skits we are presented a story in which Pee-Wee gets a precious wish awarded to him by Jambi, the head-in-a-box genie (John Paragon), but then must decide whether to use it to help his old sea salt buddy Kap'n Karl (Phil Hartman) win the love of the captivating Miss Yvonne (Lynne Marie Stewart). Recorded at the Pantages theater in L.A.
