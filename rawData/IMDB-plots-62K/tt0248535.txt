Three horror stories linked by a sinister delivery boy. The stories are "Heroine Overdose", "Pandora" and "Veteran's Day".
Horror anthology in which a demonic delivery boy brings three packages from hell to three people who wholeheartedly deserve them. In "Heroine Overdose", a sleazy misogynistic sexploitation filmmaker named Alan Smythee overdoses on heroin. Ironically, this somehow transports him into one of his films where he becomes the target of his own vengeful heroines. In "Pandora", a woman named Angela Pandorus runs over a kid by accident and, with no witnesses around, flees the crime scene. The delivery boy visits her and gives her a special jack in the box from hell. In "Veteran's Day", a middle-aged cynical draft dodger called Eric Keller is on a downward spiral thanks to his bad temper and overall attitude. On Veterans Day, a holiday that drunk Keller makes fun of, his college buddy, Novotny, who went M.I.A. three decades ago in Vietnam, appears to Keller to take him back to Vietnam hell and let him experience the fate of him and his butchered comrades for himself. James Earl Jones also stars as the "Voice of Retribution" that narrates the stories.
