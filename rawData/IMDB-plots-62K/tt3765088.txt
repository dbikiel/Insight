Bruno (Fabio Porchat) is a young film editor who has just broke up his marriage with Regina, and returned living in his mother's house. Drowned in deep sorrow, something very weird happens in his life: people around him are gradually disappearing. But only for him. Some kind of blindness.
The film editor Bruno has just separated from his wife Regina and his best friend and coworker Davi goes with him to a brothel to celebrate the separation. Bruno is temporarily living with his possessive mother and misses Regina. Out of the blue, Bruno can not see persons that are disappearing. His mother sends him to a psychiatrist while tries experiments with the attendant of a pizzeria that is invisible for Bruno. Will he recover his capacity to see people?
