A young teenage werewolf is torn between honoring her family's secret and her love for a man.
In Bucharest, Romania, the orphan Vivian was raised by her aunt after losing her parents ten years ago in the Rocky Mountains, Colorado. Her family belongs to a bloodline of werewolves and Vivian is promised to the leader of the pack, Gabriel. When the American cartoonist Aiden, who is researching werewolves for his publisher for the next edition of his magazine, meets Vivian, they immediately fall in love for each other. However, the evil son of Gabriel and Vivian's cousin Rafe poisons Gabriel about the love of Vivian, forcing her to choose between her bounds with her family and her passion for Aiden.
With the Five on her tail, a young beautiful werewolf named Vivian seeks peace in the arms of Aiden while escaping the never-ending infatuation Gabriel has on her. But when a string of accidental murders happen, this threatens to rip and expose her pack apart.
