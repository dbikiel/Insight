A dark domestic melodrama/satire about the ties that bind and the ties that really bind.
The Johnsons are an attractive, well-to-do, upper-middle class family. Sidney, husband and father, is a famous poet, known and adored for his kindness and sensitivity. Joan, wife and mother, is a dutiful housewife, an obsessive homemaker and the life of every party. Their son, Isaiah, is a charismatic young man who has just gotten married to an equally appealing young woman. In fact, there is only thing that separates the Johnsons from their charming friends and neighbors: Isaiah, the son, has been molesting Sidney, the father, since he was twelve years old. And what's more, Sidney has written a memoir that chronicles, in great detail, the ins-and-outs of this unseemly father-son relationship. Will the manuscript ever see the light of day, or will young Isaiah have a thing or two to say about it? THE STRANGE THING ABOUT THE JOHNSONS is a dark satire of the domestic melodrama, which asks "What if...?" and then, for some reason, comes up with an answer.
Pitch black dark satire about a desperate helpless father who decides to write a tell all memoir and finally expose his family's dark secret - that his beloved son has been sexually assaulting him and abusing him behind closed doors for years. However, the jealous son, who's obsessed more than ever with his twisted insatiable incestuous lust for his father, attempts to stop him from finishing the book.
