A cursed antique toy monkey from the original DeFeo home wrecks havoc and possesses a father after being gifted during an annual family reunion.
Nearly four long decades after the blood-soaked DeFeo murders in Amityville's infamous 112 Ocean Avenue, an evil-infused antique monkey toy finds its way into a small town in Nebraska, during the annual family reunion for the patriarch Mark's 50th birthday celebration. Possessed by a dark demon, the seemingly innocent gift starts to affect the otherwise kind father and to spread its malevolent influence throughout the house, as horrible visions of the dead urge Mark to spill the blood of his family. Once more, the satanic Amityville force has found the perfect host. Will they survive the weekend?
