A sexually "undeclared" college freshman's clairvoyant/prophetic dreams are the first sign that something very strange is going on involving his class-mates -- with him at the center.
Smith's everyday life in the dorm - hanging out with his arty, sarcastic best friend Stella, hooking up with a beautiful free spirit named London, lusting for his gorgeous but dim surfer roommate Thor - all gets turned upside-down after one fateful, terrifying night.
A reoccurring dream holds significance for Smith, a soon-to-be-19-year-old mostly gay college freshman. Initially only hoping his dumb-as-a-bag-of-rocks surfer roommate will open up to man-on-man sex with him, items and people first featured in the dream lead Smith to discover himself at the center of what one might think only a conspiracy theorist could concoct, revealing a cult, a dead twin, an incestuous sister, a father thought dead, a lesbian witch, satisfying straight sex, paranormal powers, and the possible end of the world.
