Catania, Sicily, 1854. An epidemic of cholera is hitting the region. 16-year old novice Maria leaves her convent and returns home to avoid the plague. Her stepmother and her half-sisters prevent her to live the normal life of a young girl. In their minds, Maria is the promised "bride of God" and a regular life is inappropriate for her. Nevertheless, she falls in love with a neighbor, Nino. Her freedom ends abruptly when she is forced to return to the convent.
