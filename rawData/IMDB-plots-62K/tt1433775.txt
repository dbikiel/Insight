Byun, whilst a good fighter, is constantly ridiculed by the village women for his tiny 'package.' However, this ends when a monk provides Byun with a massive penis and amazing sexual endurance. When all the village men are unexpectedly sent to war, Byun is overlooked, and left behind to satisfy the substantial libidos of the village women.
Hidden in the ancient Korean folklore lies a tragic character with a massive inferiority complex. Byun Kang-se's problem stems from his seriously impaired libido due to a freak accident when he was young. He lives in a small village deep inside a mountain where women's estrogen flows freely and men do not possess much control. The women tease and ridicule Byun, a man who's without manhood within, and he hides himself in the mountains. There he encounters a traveling monk and attains the ultimate male power of never-ending erection and arousal. Around this time all men are grouped and sent off to war and only Byun remains to satisfy the women of the village who are only happy to line up outside his home and quench their sexual desires and fantasies.
