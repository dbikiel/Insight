Bikes vs Cars is a documentary about the bike and what an amazing tool for change it can be. It highlights a conflict in city planning between bikes, cars and a growing reliance on fossil fuels.
Depicts a global crisis that we all deep down know we need to talk about: climate, earth's resources, cities where the entire surface is consumed by the car. An ever-growing, dirty, noisy traffic chaos. The bike is a great tool for change, but the powerful interests who gain from the private car invest billions each year on lobbying and advertising to protect their business. In the film we meet activists and thinkers who are fighting for better cities, who refuse to stop riding despite the increasing number killed in traffic.
The divide between cycling versus automobile advocacy is presented, the two sides which on the surface are on opposing sides that will never meet in terms of commonality. Cycling advocates in such automobile-centric cities such as SÃ£o Paulo and Los Angeles talk about their situations, including cycling, for one, being a personal necessity, and that being automobile-centric cities was not always the case, they only becoming so with the onset of the automobile and oil lobbies. Conversely, a taxi driver in Copenhagen, seen as one of the few shiny examples of a cycling-centric city, talks about the difficulties for him in trying to navigate among the cyclists who seem to be coming at him from every direction while he does his work. Despite the general shift in global mentality toward cycling if only as a measure to combat climate change, Toronto is provided as an example of a city where a war was directed onto the cycling community with the election of Rob Ford as Mayor, he who saw forces initiate that war against the car in his city. And others talk about what the automobile and oil lobbies are doing in light of this global shift toward more cycling and cycling infrastructure.
