In 19th century, a bullied, disfigured man dubbed Iguana flees from abusive locals, finds his own island and declares himself tyrant of his new domain. A man and a woman get stranded there and become victims of his new sadistic nature.
A grotesquely disfigured harpooner called Iguana is severely mistreated by his fellow sailors on a whaling ship in the 19th century. One night he escapes and takes up residence on a remote island. He makes himself ruler of the island and declares war on mankind. Anyone unfortunate enough to wind up on the island with Iguana is subjected to his cruel tyranny.
