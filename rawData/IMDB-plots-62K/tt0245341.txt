An actor holds a burglar hostage on New Year's Eve, after his girlfriend leaves him and his cat dies.
Jimmy (Steve Guttenberg) and Kate (Cynthia Watros) are in the middle of a break-up and completely oblivious to the fact that they're being robbed, by a gay guy. Kate splits, leaving Jimmy alone in the house with the burglar (Lombardo Boyar). They confront one another, start talking, and suddenly Jimmy's wondering if he's really, you know, "sensitive".
