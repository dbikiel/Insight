The characters from the animated Madagascar franchise, Alex, Melman, Marty and Gloria celebrate love in this Valentine special.
As Alex the lion yearns to feel the joy of a romantic Valentine's Day in sun-kissed Africa, out of the blue, a heart-shaped bottle of the precious and potent "Love Potion no. 9" falls from the sky on King Julien's head. Undoubtedly, this must be a sign from the heavens, and now, all animals--great or small--will see why this is Alex's favourite holiday. That is if the furry emperor doesn't get greedy. Will everyone in the tawny savannah catch a whiff of love's irresistible elixir?
