When filmmaker Bryan Fogel sets out to uncover the truth about doping in sports, a chance meeting with a Russian scientist transforms his story from a personal experiment into a geopolitical thriller. Dirty urine, unexplained death and Olympic gold are all part of the exposure of the biggest scandal in sports history.
Filmmaker and avid amateur cyclist Bryan Fogel decides to make a documentary on how easy it is to get away with doping in sport. He sets out to take illegal performance-enhancing substances, improve his cycling performance and show that the substances are undetectable. His task leads him to Grigory Rodchenkov, the head of the Russian anti-doping laboratory. Little does Fogel realise at the time but he is about to be involved in, and a chronicler of, sport's greatest ever doping scandal, as details are revealed of Russia's systemic, widespread, government-sponsored doping program.
