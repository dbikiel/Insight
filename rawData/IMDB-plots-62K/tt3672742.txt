In a post-apocalyptic wasteland in 1997, a comic book fan adopts the persona of his favourite hero to save his enthusiastic friend and fight a tyrannical overlord.
In a post-apocalyptic future, THE KID, a young solitary scavenger obsessed with comic books must face his fears and become a reluctant hero when he meets a mysterious girl named APPLE. Despite their efforts to keep to themselves, ZEUS, the sadistic and self-proclaimed leader of the Wasteland, plagues THE KID and APPLE. Armed with little more than blind faith and an ancient turbocharged weapon, THE KID learns of justice and friendship and embarks on an incredible journey to rid the Wasteland of evil and save the girl of his dreams.
In Wasteland's vast and barren deserts of scrap and debris in a post-apocalyptic 1997 where water is the new currency, the reclusive orphaned scavenger and die-hard comic aficionado known only as the Kid, barely manages to survive, trading relics of a bygone time for food and water. Living constantly under the sadistic monarch Zeus' heavy thumb, the Kid who struggles to lay low, is utterly unprepared for the unforeseen encounter--let alone, friendship--with the lively and free-spirited, Apple, who can't take no for an answer. However, only when Apple falls into Zeus' hands will Kid realise that his beloved Turbo Rider's newly-found high-tech justice-enforcing gear is meant for a true hero sworn to defend those in need. Will the skittish Kid step up to truly become the Turbo Kid?
It's 1997. In a ruined post-apocalyptic world, the orphaned Kid survives on his own through drought-ridden nuclear winter, traversing the Wasteland on his BMX, scavenging for scraps to trade for a scant supply of water. When his perpetually chipper, pink-haired new best friend Apple is kidnapped by a minion of evil overlord Zeus, the Kid summons the courage of his comic book hero and prepares to deliver turbocharged justice to Zeus, his buzzsaw-handed sidekick Skeletron, and their vicious masked army.
