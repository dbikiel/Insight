In dreamlike mountain scenery, Toshiko makes a daring escape from her sexually warped Uncle Sonezaki. Fortunately, she met Samehada as she runs for her life, which is also escaping from some slayers. What follows is a wild chase that leads the audience into a comically violent world.
Samehada is on the run from some gangsters from whom he has stolen some stolen property. During the chase, the pursuers crash into Toshiko, who is also on the run, in her case from a sex-crazed uncle. Toshiko and Samehada get together, and both are chased by bumbling hit man Yamada, who was hired by Toshiko's uncle, and by the gangsters.
