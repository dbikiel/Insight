Two parents find themselves fighting to get their little boy back from a sadistic cult, who have stolen him and plan on dark ideas.
Newlyweds Cory and Sarah Morgan take Cory's 7-year-old son Liam up to the country for some much needed family time. When it appears as if Liam has run away, psychological suspense becomes straight-out horror, as Sarah and Cory must now confront a sadistic cult-like family who have been hiding in the house all along and have taken Liam for themselves.
After the death of his beloved wife, the widower Cory Morgan marries Sarah and they travel on vacation to an isolated house with his son Liam. Cory expects that the resentful Liam, who misses his mother, will get close to Sarah in the next days. On the arrival, they discover that intruders have lived in the house, and they summon the local Sheriff, who calms them down- telling them that the strangers who have broken in have gone. During the night, Liam disappears and soon they witness Hawkings tied up to the steering wheel of his car. When the car explodes, they realize that they are under attack of sadistic killers, and they need to fight back to survive.
