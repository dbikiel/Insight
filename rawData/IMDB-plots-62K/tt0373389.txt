A film about the state of Chinese occupied Tibet and its history of oppression and resistance.
Filmed during nine journeys throughout Tibet, India and Nepal, this film brings audiences to the long-forbidden "rooftop of the world"... from rarely-seen rituals in remote monasteries, to horse races with Khamba warriors; from brothels and slums in the holy city of Lhasa, to magnificent Himalayan peaks still traveled by nomadic yak caravans. The dark secrets of Tibet's recent past are chronicled through personal stories and interviews, and a collection of undercover and archival images. TIBET: CRY OF THE SNOW LION is an epic story of courage and compassion.
