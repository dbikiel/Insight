A scene from Charles Hoyt's 'A Milk White Flag': A brass band marches out, led by bandmaster Steele Ayers. When Ayers reaches his position, he turns around and directs the musicians as they take up their own positions.
A band leader in full dress and cap, waving a baton, leads a nine-member brass band out onto the stage. Dressed to the nines with high hats, the band forms two rows of four or five chaps across as the band leader turns toward them to direct. As they play, each one swings his instrument and moves his head from side to side in time with the music, while the band leader conducts with both arms spreading widely.
