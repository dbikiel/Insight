Female reporter Torchy Blane teams with her cop boyfriend Lt. Steve McBride to solve the killing of an investor who just bought a popular local nightclub.
Journalist Torchy Blane and her fiance Lt. Steve McBride are trying to solve the murder of Tim Torgson, who was killed right before Torchy's eyes.
Fitz Mularkey is well-respected owner of a popular L. A. nightclub, especially by police Lt. Steve McBride, primarily because, unlike other area night spots, he runs it cleanly and honestly. Mularkey wants to divest himself of the club in order to marry beautiful Marcia Friel and sells out to 'Tiny' Torgenson despite offers from other sources. After talking to McBride's girlfriend, ace reporter Torchy Blane, Torgenson is assassinated at Union Station right in front of the newshound. McBride and Torchy team up to find out who killed him and why.
