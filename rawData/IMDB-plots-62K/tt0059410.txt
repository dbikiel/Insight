Satire on the funeral business, in which a young British poet goes to work at a Hollywood cemetery.
Newly arrived in Hollywood from England, Dennis Barlow finds he has to arrange his uncle's interment at the highly-organised and very profitable Whispering Glades funeral parlour. His fancy is caught by one of their cosmeticians, Aimee Thanatogenos. But he has three problems - the strict rules of owner Blessed Reverand Glenworthy, the rivalry of embalmer Mr Joyboy, and the shame of now working himself at The Happy Hunting Ground pets' memorial home.
Director Tony Richardson's trenchant black humour suffuses Evelyn Waugh's morbid take on the American fascination with death, and it's funeral business, follows young Barlow after the death of his uncle, an English ex-pat who worked in Hollywood.
