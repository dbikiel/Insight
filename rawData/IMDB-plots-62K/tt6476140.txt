A fishing boat captain juggles facing his mysterious past and finding himself ensnared in a reality where nothing is what it seems.
Baker Dill (Matthew McConaughey) is a fishing boat captain leading tours off a tranquil, tropical enclave called Plymouth Island. His quiet life is shattered, however, when his ex-wife Karen (Anne Hathaway) tracks him down with a desperate plea for help. She begs Dill to save her - and their young son - from her new, violent husband (Jason Clarke) by taking him out to sea on a fishing excursion, only to throw him to the sharks and leave him for dead. Karen's appearance thrusts Dill back into a life he'd tried to forget, and as he struggles between right and wrong, his world is plunged into a new reality that may not be all that it seems.
A lone fisherman, Baker Dill, who escaped from his past to a remote island, meets with his ex-girlfriend Karen. She asks Dill to kill her cruel husband, who also comes to the island. The swirling neonoire against the backdrop of exotic landscapes "Serenity" was shot by British director and screenwriter Stephen Knight. The captain of a fishing vessel, Baker Dill, spends his days, indistinguishable from each other, on a tropical island, earns money from wealthy tourists and sees the purpose of his life in catching one particular tuna called Justice.
