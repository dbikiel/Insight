Jason Gould satirizes coming out in Hollywood in "Inside Out", starring Alexis Arquette and his father Elliott Gould. Lane Janger's "Just One Time" was a festival favorite later expanded into a feature film that turns the tables on a groom-to-be and his fantasies of sex with two women. Bradley Rust Gray's "hITCH" follows two attractive young guys on a dizzying road trip that leads them toward sexual self-discovery. David Fourier's "Majorettes in Space" is a witty French spoof of post-modern sex, romance, relationships, the Pope and baton-twirling majorettes. Gregory Cooke's "$30" is the bittersweet story of a closeted teen presented with a young prostitute on his 16th birthday.
