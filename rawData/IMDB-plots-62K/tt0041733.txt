Parole officers fight against gangsters trying to infiltrate the parole system.
When several notorious criminals are unjustifiably released on parole, the Federal Government smells a rat and sends ace agent Richard Hendricks to investigate. Hendricks infiltrates the gang, responsible for the parole racket by posing as a much-wanted convict Rick Carson. However, the wily Barney Rodescu, who is the brain behind the racket, soon finds out Carson's true identity. Carson's life is now in grave danger.
An expose of the bribery of parole board officials by the underworld to obtain the illegal release of hardened gangsters from prison. The government sends FBI agent Richard Hendricks, at the request of the state governor, to investigate. Posing as a big-time racketeer, Hendricks works his way into a gang; finds their way of reaching certain parole board members, uses this method to get a convict pardoned, and then traps the whole gang.
The Parole Board has consistently granted freedom to some of him most dangerous criminals who return to crime and the FBI is curious as to the reason this keeps happening. Government agent Richard Hendricks (Michael O'Shea) goes undercover to investigate just where the hole is in the system believing that it may be payoffs coming from and illicit criminal connection. Hendricks meets Jojo Dumont (Evelyn Ankers), a saloon owner who uses a corral of crooks to manage her operations and gets money for payoffs to some members on the parole board. Hendricks discovers that cultured businessman Barney Rodescu (Turhan Bey) is indeed the link between the illegally paroled criminals and the corrupt board members as he pays them for their leniency. When Hendricks sets up a phony rendezvous between the board and Rodescu, it looks as if all the lawbreakers will be caught but then one of the crooks recognizes the government agent.
