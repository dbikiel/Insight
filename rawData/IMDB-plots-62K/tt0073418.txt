Left in the lounge for first-class passengers, a letter warns of murders on Flight 502 -- and the warning is received a day early.
A jumbo jet leaves New York. After the plane has departed, a note is found in the first class lounge with an ominous message left by a passenger threatening to kill some of the passengers. At first it is thought to be a sick joke, but soon a man posing as a priest and a stewardess are killed. It is up to the captain to find the killer before the body count increases.
After a plane takes off for London, a note is found in the airport saying that some people are going to be killed. And it is not long after that, that someone is killed. The captain tries to keep the passengers calm while the people on the ground do background checks on everyone and they learn that some of the passengers have history with one another. But it seems that there's a lot more going on.
