Dolittle must save a forest and a bear's life.
Dr. John Dolittle the beloved doctor is back, but this time around he plays cupid to bumbling circus bear Archie as he's so smitten by a Pacific Western bear female, Ava. Dr. Dolittle must help a group of forest creatures to save their forest. But with the aid of his mangy, madcap animal friends, Dr. Dolittle must teach Archie the ways of true romance in time to save his species and his home before their habit is gone. So John held a meeting for every animal in the forest to not give up without a fight no matter what kind of animal expression they have and everyone agrees to do it and save their home.
Since we last saw him Dr. Dolittle has earned fame and recognition both among two- and four-legged creatures for his ability to talk to animals. But his hectic workdays causes him to put family life on the back burner. When he is faced with the challenge of reintroducing a circus bear into the wild in order to save a forest, he also gets the opportunity to better his relationship with his wife and eldest daughter.
