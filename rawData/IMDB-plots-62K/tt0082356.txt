In late 14th century medieval Serbia becomes the target of Ottoman invaders. One of their renegade gangs burns the castle and takes young wife of Banovic Strahinja, respected Serbian noble. Banovic Strahinja begins long and almost futile quest for her wife despite everybody else's doubts in her fidelity.
The story takes place during the middle ages in Serbia. While estate owner Banovic Strahinja is out hunting, a Turkish bandit Alija attacks his castle. The Turks kill all of his servants and kidnap his beloved Andja. When he discovers what has happened, Strahinja gathers a posse of scoundrels and goes after the bandits. In the meantime, Alija tries to seduce Andja, but she refuses him. Nevertheless, with the passage of time she begins to weaken.
