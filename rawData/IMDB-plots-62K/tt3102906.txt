Focused on a director and his leading actress while they are off the set. They discuss the discrepancies between film and digital cinema, Western and Eastern food, and try to capture an unfiltered (and seemingly impossible) sense of "reality" on film.
During the production of his latest movie, a bold director feels the need to alter the scenario by adding a brand-new scene. With this in mind, the scene needs to be as long and as realistic as it can be, and with an emphasis on the aesthetic female nudity--after all--he strongly believes that this addition will aid the narrative to a great extent. And just like that, between lunch and dinner, commences a seemingly endless string of negotiations with the lead female protagonist, discussing the differences of analogue and digital cinematography; the sophistication of diverse cuisines, and above all, the history of cinema. However, will they ever reach a conclusion?
