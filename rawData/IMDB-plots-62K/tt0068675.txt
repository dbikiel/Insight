After she is raped and her husband murdered, a woman hires a bounty hunter to instruct her in the use of a gun so she can get her revenge on the three outlaws responsible.
Hannie enlists the aid of bounty hunter Tom Price to teach her how to be a gunfighter so she can hunt down the three men who killed her husband and raped her.
With the Mexican Federal Police hot on their trail after a botched bank robbery, the Clemens Brothers--the vicious gang of the blood-thirsty outlaws, Emmett, Rufus, and Frank--find refuge in Jim and Hannie Caulder's secluded relay station. As one thing leads to another, before long, the defenceless frontier woman will find herself brutally attacked, stripped both of her earthly possessions and her dignity, and left for dead. However, a chance encounter with the most efficient bounty hunter in the American West, Thomas Luther Price, will pave the way for a reluctant alliance, and Hannie's radical transformation from a weak housewife to a merciless gunslinger. Now that the untamed wildcat who packs a widow-making revolver has made her list, who is going to stand in the way of her roaring rampage of revenge?
