The young woman Laura Fischer has a session with a psychologist. The session begins with Laura telling that after two years of successive rapes of female students riding bicycles in the woods nearby the campus of the college where she studied, the student Emma Machielsen forms a committee with Josien Schippers, Marieke Kopermode, Bonnie Javoer and her to discuss a possible solution with the dean. However, the dean claims that he has no budget to improve the security and could only afford to provide three buses for the students. The girls decide to bike through the woods together in convoy, but when Marieke is late, they leave her alone in the campus. She decides to cross the woods alone, and the serial rapist rapes her. Her friends decide to investigate the crimes by themselves and they prepare a list of possible rapists, leading the group to a tragic consequence.
