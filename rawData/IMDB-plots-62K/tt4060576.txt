With the old days of glamour long forgotten, Colton West, the once-popular movie star and action hero from the 90s, is now reduced to acting in low-budget movies about horrific bugs. But when suddenly, a swarm of earthquakes hits Southern California, a string of unprecedented events, chaos, and lava will give birth to a new breed of lava-breathing arachnids, forcing Colton to find his family before it's too late. Once more, this intrepid man of action will have to do what he knows best, armed only with a shotgun and the will to survive. However, what can a single man do against an endless army of monstrous Lavalantulas?
