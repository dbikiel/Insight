A scientist attempts to master the art of transferring people's souls into puppets.
Robert "Tank" begins to work for Dr. Magrew sculpting a puppet for the Doctor to bring to life using the work of Andre Toulon. Robert begins to fall in love with the Doctors daughter, Jane. Unbeknownst to Robert, the Doctor is trying to create a "perfect race" of puppet humans. Jane discovers a "matt puppet" which is from his first assistant. She comes back just in time to see her father, cut up by the puppets, has succeeded in putting a living human, Robert, into the puppet he carved.
Back for retribution, the living puppets of Andre Toulon are stirred to action, mounting a crusade to foil the diabolical plans of their new insane villainous master. Can they stop the dastardly Dr. Magrew before he transforms another unwitting victim into the newest member of the puppet lineage? Companion action figures sold separately!
The new puppet master, Dr. Magrew and his daughter Jane take a drive and arrive for a gasoline refill and meet the supposibly gental giant, Robert "Tank" Winsley and defend him from bully Joey Carp and his gain. And after seeing what special work Tank can do, Magrew hires him as his new assistant since his earlier one dissapeared without a trace. The time they spend together, Tank and Jane start having feelings for each other that cause her father to go off his nut. As he controls the puppets, he will use them to wreak bloody attacks against his enemies.
