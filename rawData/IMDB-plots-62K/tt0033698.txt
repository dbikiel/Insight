This time Bugs is chased by hunting dog Willoughby.
Bugs is being chased again, this time by a dog named Willoughby. The clumsy mutt is incredibly stupid, literally falling for Bugs' cons again and again. Bugs becomes a bit overconfident in his dealing with the dog, though, and finds himself falling for his own tricks. In the end, cartoon logic wins out over the laws of gravity--or does it?
