The story of three young women who are good friends, helping each other in their struggle to become adults.
Three women approaching 30 find themselves in varying degrees of unfortunate romance. The first still has emotional scars from her mother's long ago suicide and can't keep from noticing her photographer boy friend's not-too-furtive looks at his teen daughter's obviously nubile body. The second has just been married seven months and finds her husband is a credit card addict who quickly ruins their credit rating. The last is separated from her philandering husband and is having a series of revengeful affairs that ultimately lead to a beating by one of her pick-ups.
