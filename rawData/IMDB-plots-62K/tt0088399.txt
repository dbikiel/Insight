And because of his obsession his new wife is driven to taking a lover - who mysteriously becomes paralyzed. Piotr keeps a special house on his property dedicated to Angelika, and daydreams about making love to her there. Meanwhile, his teenage son Pawelek begins to wonder who his parents are and disappears from the house every night.
