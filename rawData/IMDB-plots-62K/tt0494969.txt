Four good friends, all seventeen-year old, lose their innocence during their last summer together. Flanders 1996. Rik, Tim, Roel and Bart aimlessly wile away the summer days in a small village where nothing exciting ever happens. When Rik becomes fascinated by the mysterious Sandrine, the boy's friendship comes under increasing pressure. Their reckless behaviour lands the boys in a web of intrigue, which they have a hard time escaping from.
While family is on holiday, Rik spends the summer holiday with three equally frustrated classmate-buddies in their boring Flemish hamlet, drinking and pulling pranks while dreaming of loosing their virginity. The publican's unruly daughter Sandrine, greatly to their taste, has a row with her riper boyfriend Jimmy and runs away. She becomes Rik's house-guest and lover. She fails to warn him dad ignores her whereabouts and actually reported her missing, so the police suspects a kidnapping, worsened by a misunderstood prank from Rik's envious mates.
