The insane government bureaucracy at a state pension window.
In an office processing pension applications, people wait. Clerks give instructions and explanations, finding fault with each document presented. People smoke, standing in line with papers in hand. A clerk sharpens a pencil methodically. Papers are stamped, further instructions given. Someone makes tea. The clerks take their break while people wait quietly. Papers have been stacked, sorted, placed in folders, and filed - row upon row, shelf upon shelf of files. Enervation is all.
