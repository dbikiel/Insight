Two years in the making, "The Art of FLIGHT" gives iconic snowboarder Travis Rice and friends the opportunity to redefine what is possible in the mountains. Experience the highs, as new tricks are landed and new zones opened, alongside the lows, where avalanches, accidents, and wrong-turns strike.
Jaw dropping footage with a pulse-pounding soundtrack, shot in some of the most rugged, remote and beautiful snow country on the planet. Snow boarding as you've never seen it, unless you are one of the handful of daredevils willing to risk life and limb for the glory revealed here.
