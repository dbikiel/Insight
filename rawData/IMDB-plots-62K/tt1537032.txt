A CBI officer moonlights as a modern day Robin Hood in the guise of the masked Kanthaswamy, as he helps fight corruption and aid impoverished people.
Impoverished people in modern secular India find their wishes being fulfilled after leaving a written request at a Bhagwan Shri Murugan/Shivji Mandir. A disbelieving DIG of Police instructs his team to investigate but ends up frustrated when they themselves become believers and devotees. He then assigns this case to Ravi Sharma, an atheist, with hopes of apprehending the suspect, a CBI Officer, Kanthaswamy/Krishna, who works with the Economics Offenses Wing, and had publicly exposed many high-profile cases, including the wealthy Ponnusamy/Padmanath. This results in the latter getting paralyzed and his enraged daughter, Subbalakshmi, swearing to avenge this humiliation by attempting to ensnare Kanthaswamy in a web of lies and deceit - while the police continue to be baffled by repeated sightings of a caped crusader - who not only appears to have superpowers but can also fly.
Mallanna, a CBI officer, raids corrupt people, Triple P being one of them. When Mallanna intelligently turns tables on Triple P, he lands in trouble. Triple P's daughter Subbalakshmi arrives and starts to seduce Mallanna strongly, with the aim of seeking revenge from him. Mallanna too doesn't get easily carried away, and pretends to be in love with her. Meanwhile, a jealous DIG always tries to find cases for Mallanna. But what no one except Mallanna and his team knows a bigger secret about Mallanna himself: He's a superhero. CBI officer in the day and a rooster superhero by night. With enough power and support from his team and the public, despite of Subba's seduction and enmity with the corrupt officials, Mallanna sets out on a mission to disclose every hidden secret of corruption in the system.
