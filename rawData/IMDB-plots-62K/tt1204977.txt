The film opens with a young Laine Morris &amp; Debbie Galardi playing with a Ouija board while in Laine's room, only to be interrupted by Laine's sister Sarah. The scene then fast forwards to present day, where Debbie is playing with the board by herself &amp; is so unnerved by what she experiences that she tries to burn the board &amp; planchette before calling Laine. Concerned, Laine comes over to check up on her friend but is sent away by Debbie, who promptly goes upstairs only to find the board sitting on her bed. She looks through the board's planchette, her eyes then turn white and Debbie hangs herself. The following day Laine is spending time with her boyfriend Trevor at a diner, where they meet up with their friend Isabelle. Before long Laine receives a text message stating that she should return home, where she finds her family waiting to tell her about Debbie's death. Laine manages to make it through the funeral &amp; afterwards Debbie's mother asks her if Laine can watch the house for them while they're away, as they cannot bring themselves to remain in the house, to which Laine agrees. While house-sitting, Laine finds Debbie's Ouija board &amp; decides to gather Sarah, Trevor, Isabelle, &amp; Debbie's boyfriend Pete to hold a seance with the board. They manage to make contact with someone who is identified initially as D, which Laine immediately convinces herself and the rest of the group that it must mean Debbie is the one they are communicating with. After which, they receive the message "hi friend". Despite believing that this is Debbie, the group is too frightened to continue playing with the board. They're drawn back to the board however a couple of nights later after each person finds this message in various locations in their daily life. Upon further interaction with the board the group discovers that the spirit is not Debbie but someone identifying as DZ. Laine looks through the planchette in the hopes of seeing the ghost and sees a young girl with her mouth stitched closed, who then uses the planchette to warn the group to run from her mother, whose ghost Laine also sees while looking through the planchette. The group disbands and each heads home, only for a malicious spirit to follow Isabelle home and murder her. This causes strife between Trevor and Laine, as he believes that if she'd never held the seance then Isabelle would still be alive. They decide to research Debbie's house and finds that a young girl was placed in a mental institution after killing her mother, who she claims killed her sister, Doris, at that same location. The two travel to the institution &amp; meet Paulina Zander, who states that their mother killed Doris and sewed her mouth shut because she believed that spirits were trying to communicate through her. Trevor and Laine quickly head home &amp; unleash the spirits of Doris &amp; Mrs Zander. Doris manages to overcome her mother and the group believes that everything has been resolved. Unfortunately, this proves to be far from the case as Pete is later killed by Doris. Laine confronts Paulina about this, only to realize that Doris &amp; Paulina were the evil ones &amp; that Mrs Zander was trying to stop them. They manage to gain assistance through Laine's grandmother, who tells them that the only way to stop the ghost is to burn Doris's body &amp; the Ouija board set. This proves easier said than done and Trevor is also killed before Sarah manages to locate the corpse. Both Sarah &amp; Laine are attacked by Doris &amp; it is only through the intervention of Debbie's spirit that the girls survive &amp; manage to burn Doris's corpse &amp; the Ouija board set, destroying Doris. The two sisters return home, only for Laine to find the planchette waiting for her in her room.
