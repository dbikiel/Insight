The Bowery Boys---Slip , Sach, Bobby, Gabe, Whitey, and Chuck---accidentally enter the detective business with the disappearance of a beautiful girl, Eleanor Williams, as their first case to solve. They are retained by Selena, who says she is the missing girl's sister. The disappearance is doubly puzzling because Eleanor has just learned that her long-lost husband, Tom Williams, is returning from South America. Slip and Company trace Eleanor to the apartment of Dr. Rolfe Carter, to whom she first went when Tom was reported missing three years earlier. Slip witnesses the doctor's murder, but does not know who fired the fatal shot. Slip and his friends learn that Dr. Carter was a pseudo-psychic, who was into blackmailing his clients. He is linked with syndicate-chief Armand. The latter, and his henchman, knowing that Slip has information regarding Carter's murder, set out to kill the boys.
Sach and Slip go to a private detective agency to collect money Sach earned for working there. A woman comes in, mistakes the two for private detectives, and hires them to find a missing woman. The case isn't quite what it seems to be, and the boys find themselves mixed up in intrigue, blackmail, and a crooked fortune teller.
