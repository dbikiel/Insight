What seemed to be a simple little trip becomes an international chase, when an extremely rare bottle of wine's discovered (bottled during the appearance of the Great Comet of 1811). Margaret Harwood's sent to retrieve it so it can be auctioned. Oliver Plexico is her travel guide/bodyguard, because there's other people who desperately want this bottle, and they'll stop at nothing to get it.
