George, now a father, goes to Las Vegas, where he has to help out his brother.
It's been 5 years since socialite Ursula Stanhope left civilization to marry George, lovable and clumsy King of the Jungle. Now father to George Junior, George finds himself stressed at having to juggle his cherished roles of jungle king, Junior's dad, and Ursula's loving husband. George's stress level goes way up when Really Mean Lion challenges him for leadership of the jungle, and Ursula's mother Beatrice teams up with Ursula's ex-fiance Lyle in a plot to forcibly take away all that George holds most dear.
George is now a father to Junior. He is also Ursula's husband and the king of the jungle. Because of this, George finds it hard to balance his time between his different roles. Even worse, Ursula's mother Beatrice comes back to try and bring Junior and Ursula back to civilization along with Lyle van de Groot, who also plans to steal the deed to Ape Mountain. After hearing Ape is in trouble, George takes Ursula and Junior to Vegas. Lyle steals the deed to Ape Mountain and sends bulldozers there. He also hires a hypnotist that makes Ursula forget George. George is suddenly torn between saving the jungle, or getting back the family he loves.
