Having gone missing seven years ago, the previously blind Prairie returns home, now in her twenties with her sight restored. While many believe she is a miracle, others worry that she could be dangerous.
Created and written by Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij (The East), this Netflix original delves into the inexplicable reappearance of Prairie Johnson (Marling). Having gone missing seven years ago, the previously blind Johnson returns home, now in her late 20s and with her sight restored. While many believe she is miracle, others worry that she could be dangerous.
The OA, Netflix new original series, concerns the apparently miraculous return of a young woman who had been missing for 7 years. When she originally disappeared, she was blind and now her sight has been somehow restored. Plus, now she has severe scarring on her back which, she either will not explain how she got the scars or she truly does not remember how the scarring happened. When she is first questioned, she not only does not remember her name but anyone she meets, at least at first. To some people she is a miracle and to others, she is dangerous. The truth is rarely simple or easy.
