Cheli, 27, is raising her mentally challenged 24yo sister, Gaby, alone. When the social worker finds out that Cheli leaves Gaby alone in the house while Cheli is at work, Cheli is compelled to place Gaby in a day program. For the first time in her life, Cheli shares Gaby's care with someone else; her daily routine collapses and the huge void left by Gaby's absence makes room for a man in Cheli's life in the shape of Zohar, who inadvertently creates a chink in the sisters' symbiotic relationship. While Cheli hangs on to Zohar's love for all she's worth, her inability to have a normal, intimate, and emotional relationship with anyone but her sister forces them into a twisted threesome, where boundaries between love, sacrifice, nurturing, and torturing are crossed.
Cheli is mentally handicapped Gaby's sister, guardian, and roommate in their cramped apartment in a working-class neighborhood, all in addition to working at the local school, where she meets PE teacher Zohar.
When it becomes clear that Gaby needs a placement, Cheli enrolls her in a day program for special-needs adults, which Cheli comes to enjoy.Meanwhile, Zohar proves himself to be a wonderful guy besides helping Cheli out financially and with the heavy lifting of Gaby's care, which grows ever more intense and burdensome. Zohar moves in with Cheli and Gaby and all appears to be going well, except that Cheli is having difficulty detaching from Gaby, with whom she has developed an intense and intimate relationship over a lifetime of caring for her sister.After Zohar has been living with them for several weeks or more, Cheli discovers Gaby to be pregnant. Seeing no other possibility other than Zohar being the father, she kicks him out with no explanation and arranges an abortion for Gaby.As Gaby is recovering at home, her day group comes over to visit her. During the visit it emerges that one of the other adults in the program was the father.The final scene has Cheli in the bathroom, banging her head on the tile wall, as Gaby does when she is inconsolably upset.
