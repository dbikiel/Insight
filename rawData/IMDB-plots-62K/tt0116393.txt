Black police officer discovers a cell of white supremacist vigilantes within his department.
Gang In Blue is based on the real life investigations of several US police forces for racism and corruption. This production focuses on one of these police forces where Michael Rhoades is a new recruit who discovers much to his horror, a band of little Hitlers known as the 'Phantoms'. They let Rhoades know almost straight away that he is not wanted there and when he discovers corruption is rife he finds he is the target of a vicious campaign to set him up.
