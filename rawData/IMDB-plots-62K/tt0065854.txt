An anthology of four horror stories revolving around a mysterious rental house in the U.K.
A Scotland Yard investigator looks into four mysterious cases involving an unoccupied house and its tragic previous tenants: 1) A hack novelist encounters a strangler who's the villain of his books, leading his wife to question his sanity, 2) Two men are obsessed with a wax figure of a woman from their past, 3) A little girl with a stern, widowed father displays an interest in witchcraft, and 4) An arrogant horror film actor purchases a black cloak which gives him a vampire's powers.
In The Cloak episode, temperamental horror film star Paul Henderson [Jon Pertwee] has rented the house for the duration of the filming of his latest vampire movie. Paul longs for the days when movie castles and wardrobes weren't made out of cheap materials, so he decides to go shopping for a real cloak. In the costume shop of Theo von Hartmann [Geoffrey Bayldon], Paul finds the perfect cloak, and Hartmann is only happy to give it to him for the paltry sum of 13 shillings. The problem is that the cloak does strange things when Paul puts it on. For example, he can't see himself in a mirror. And a strange compulsion makes him bite co-star Carla Lynde [Ingrid Pitt]in the neck. And then there's the problem of the fangs and keeping his feet on the ground. It appears that, come midnight, wearing the cloak turns him into a vampire. When he tries to explain about the cloak to Carla, she taunts him into wearing it in front of her in order to prove that there's nothing wrong with it. When the clock strikes midnight, just as Carla predicted, nothing happens. Then Paul notices that he's wearing the studio cape. Carla pulls out the real cape, drapes it around her shoulders, bares her fangs, and goes after Paul, saying that the other vampires were so impressed with his work that they wanted him to be one of them.
