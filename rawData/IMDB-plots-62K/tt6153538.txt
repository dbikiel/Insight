The story of a young and nice witch who learns everything there is to know about magic, in order to be accepted by the other older mean witches.
A wee witch of 'only' 147 years dreams of joining the Bloxberg coven and sneaks into its annual festival to dance, but is caught. She opts for a punishment with perspective: she may take the admission text next year if she has learned all the spells from the huge magic book. However a hostile witch, appointed by the chief witch to supervise her all year, observes her break the ban on magic on Fridays and befriended two kids of the despised human race. Having learned the spells and practices many, she still turns up for her test, which turns ugly for all.
