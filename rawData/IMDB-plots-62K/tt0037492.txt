When two bumbling barbers act as agents for a talented but unknown singer, they stage a phony murder in order to get him a plum role.
Buzz and Abercrombie are agents trying to get Jeff Parker the lead in a movie musical. Routines include Lou's insomnia and his being unable to hear Bud due to his wearing an earplug. Lots of movie studio stuff.
