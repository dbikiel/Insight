However, as might be expected crime follows Marlowe as he is soon mixed up in blackmail and murders as a sleazy photographer (David Keith) threatens to expose photos of a former stripper (La Joy Farr) who is now running with a billionaire. As things progress, he soon realizes that his new wife's father (Joe Don Baker) is also involved.
