A documentary about the stereotype of the gay voice.
Approaching middle age, David Thorpe, South Carolina born and bred but who has lived most of his adult life in New York City, laments his single gay status at this stage in his life. In his self-critical view, he blames that single status partly on what he considers his stereotypical gay sounding voice, something that he himself does not like and believes that most gay men do not like in others in wanting partners who are more masculine sounding. David goes to vocal coaches/speech therapists to help him transform his voice into what he considers that more standard sounding nondescript male voice. Concurrently, he speaks to gay celebrities about their voice and what if anything they did to it, and to historians and other experts about how the gay voice came into being, its history and if there is any thought to it being biologically inherent to gay men, or if it truly is a product of environment. He also talks to long time friends and family members about his own gay voice, which may have emerged on a more conscious level than he would have initially thought. Through the entire process, David comes to some conclusions about that voice which may also surprise him.
