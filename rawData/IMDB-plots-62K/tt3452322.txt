A simple, domestic love story about a man who takes his skin off for his girlfriend, and why it probably wasn't the best idea...
How far would you go for love? Would you obey unhesitatingly the silent commands of your beloved one, and where would you draw the line? For instance, would you change yourself irrevocably for your significant other, furthermore, would you literally bear yourself totally naked in front of him? Man is naked without his shell, and love is sacrifice.
