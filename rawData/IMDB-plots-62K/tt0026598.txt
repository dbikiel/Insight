A parrot invades a cockroach nightclub and kidnaps its star dancer.
A Mexican Cafe after hours is the setting for a cockroach party a la Joe's Apartment (1996), where the eponymous star of the show is a hot, six-legged senorita in a red dress. An interloping parrot chashes the party, apparently determined to have the guest of honor as a snack. But the audience is not about to give up the object of their collective affection so easily, and one heroic bug manages to torch the parrot's tail and rescue the damsel in distress, which is, of course, a good excuse to continue the fiesta on into the night. Freling did partial remake of this cartoon the following year with flies and a spider standing in for the roaches and parrot in Bingo Crosbyana (1936).
When a Mexican caf√© is closed, the cockroach community is hustling and bustling. A cockroach traffic cop uses an egg-beater as a rotating traffic sign. A ferry boat is a teacup powered by an egg-beater; and it takes its passengers across the kitchen sink. Bowling is a sport played with an olive (as the bowling ball) and turnips (as the bowling pins). Tennis players use a cheese grater for a net and a pea for a tennis ball; and the spectators sit in an egg carton. The roaches' nightclub features the beautiful lady in red, who intoxicates the male patrons with her provocative dancing. Unfortunately, a parrot escapes from his cage and causes trouble that climaxes with him kidnapping the lady in red.
