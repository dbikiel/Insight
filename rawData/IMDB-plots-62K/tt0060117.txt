Various stage coach passengers and outlaws travelling through Indian country are forced to join forces against the Apaches.
When drifters Jim Walker and Bill Gibson find a settlers' wagon destroyed by Apaches, they immediately suspect an Apache uprising. The Tontos and the Mescaleros Apaches have stirred trouble in recent months, partially to protest against settlers' incursions on Apache lands. The two drifters ride into an Apache ambush and they have to fight their way out. Shortly after, they encounter a Cavalry patrol and they inform Captain Gannon about a possible Apache revolt. Captain Gannon is skeptical about it but agrees to allow the two drifters join his column on their way to Apache Wells where the Captain expects a full report from Jim and Bill regarding their incident with the Apaches. Meanwhile, in Apache Wells, the stagecoach lines' regional manager, Hoyt Taylor, is preparing to board the stage for Lordsburg. He is carrying a large sum of money belonging to the stage lines.Aware of this, outlaws Vance Buckner, Jess Cooney and Toby Jack Saunders plan to rob the stagecoach outside the town. Two of them pose as stagecoach passengers while the third plans to join them at the next relay station. Also on the stage is another passenger, Janice MacKenzie, a saloon girl of dubious morals whom the townsfolk have shunned and ordered out of their community. The Cavalry patrol and drifters Jim Walker and Bill Gibson also arrive in town, after being harassed on the way by Apaches. When asked to provide escort to the stagecoach to Lordsburg, Captain Gannon refuses and advises against the voyage, due to concerns over the Apaches but most passengers and the stage line managers insist on making the trip. Last minute, drifters Jim and Bill join the stagecoach and ride shotgun. The perilous voyage to Lordsburg begins.
