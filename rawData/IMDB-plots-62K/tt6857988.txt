A shameless chauvinist gets a taste of his own medicine when he wakes up in a world dominated by women and locks horns with a powerful female author.
Alexandra, 40, is a dominant seductress that nothing and no one seems to destabilize. His meeting with Damien, a forty-year-old big mouth, will upset his balance. Everything opposes and yet - By agreeing to lower the mask, these two will love each other against all odds. A fluoroscopy of the romantic relationship telling the story of a woman and a man, from their first meeting to their separation, in a world like ours, to this little thing close - that women and men are reversed there.
