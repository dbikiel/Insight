Norah Benson (Shirley MacLaine), an affluent socialite living in the upper east side of New York City, seems to be living the perfect life as a divorced mother of two. After her mother's suicide, she becomes a mother figure in the close relationship she has with her younger brother Joel Delany (Perry King). However, Joel begins to a act very unusually. He tries to attack a man, and has to be taken to a mental asylum, and begins to lose his usual free-spirited kindness in exchange for a turbulent personality. After witnessing the acts of her brother and finally breaking down the shield of her affluence and naivety, Norah seeks the help of a spiritismo who will attempt to exorcise the spirit of a murderer they believe to be possessing Joel.
