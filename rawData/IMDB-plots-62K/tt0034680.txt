Dr. Gillespie's health is failing, and the hospital is urging him to get a new assistant that he doesn't want. So, he poses a stumper in class to discourage all the bright young students; unfortunately, he gets three smart-alecky youngsters who all know the answer: Randall Adams (clean-cut American type), Lee Wong How (from Brooklyn), and Dennis LIndsey (Aussie). In typical Gillespie fashion, he sets about showing them there's more to doctoring than book-learning, and assigns each intern to an impossible case of diagnosis, saying that whoever gets it right will become his new assistant.
