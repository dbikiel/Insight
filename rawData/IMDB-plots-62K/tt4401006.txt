Facing difficult times and with their glory days long gone, the eight undisputed British vampire overlords gather up for their semi-centennial meeting. However, before the break of dawn, there will be blood. And corpses. Lots of them.
In a quiet countryside farmhouse, Britain's vampires gather for their once-every-fifty-years meeting. Others will be joining them too; Sebastian Crockett, an unwitting Essex boy who thinks he's on a promise with sexy cougar Vanessa; and a detachment of Special Forces vampire killers who have bitten off more than they can chew. This is certainly going to be a night to remember... and for some of them it will be their last.
With their glory days long gone, the eight gloomy and undisputed British vampire overlords gather up for their semi-centennial meeting in a secluded farmhouse, facing all difficult times. For ages, there have been always eight in the Vampire Council led by the regal and impartial Duke, unfortunately, however, now that they are one member short, an unaware and utterly unwilling volunteer in the person of young Sebastian is called to fill in the gap. But soon, the democratic procedures will be interrupted by Vatican's special vampire-killing Elite Force, and before the break of dawn, the soil will be drenched in newly-spilled thick blood and covered with corpses. Lots of them.
