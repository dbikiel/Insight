A man's failed suicide attempt enables him to see ghosts, who later keep following him everywhere. It is now up to him to fulfill their wishes to make them go away.
After a failed suicide attempt, Sang-man wakes up in the hospital with the ability to see ghosts. He bumps into four ghosts who keep following him everywhere he go. He then reluctantly works to fulfill all their wishes to make them leave him for good. On his way to help the ghosts, Sang-man meets nurse Yun-soo and attempts to win her heart.
After several failed suicide attempts, Sang-Man (Tae-hyun Cha) wakes up at the hospital with the ability to see and hear four ghosts: a chain-smoking taxi driver (Chang-Seok Ko); a woman who sobs constantly (Young-nam Jang); a perverted old man (Moon-su Lee); and an elementary school boy (Bo-geun Cheon). Sang-Man wonders why the ghosts keep following him around, and after consulting with a fortune teller, agrees to help the ghosts find closure with their deaths if they agree to leave him alone. Sang-Man allows each ghost to occupy his body, allowing them to interact with the living world. Sang-Man helps the ghosts fulfill their last wishes, and in doing so, ends up helping himself find a reason to live.
