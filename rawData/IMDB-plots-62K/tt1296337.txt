Centers on a group of weary Middle Eastern refugees who have made their way to Turkey to apply for European visas.
A film based on true stories about a group of refugees trying desperately to reach the holy land of freedom. A film about mankind's universal need to have dreams - and the courage to pursue these dreams, even though many of them dissolve into thin air. Stories of illusions and periods of uncertainty, of people with very different natures, sharing the same universal dream: at least a moment of freedom.
