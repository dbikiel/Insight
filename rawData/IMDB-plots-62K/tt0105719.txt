A business man buys a house, but he has a hard time trying to get rid of its previous tenant, a dirty bum.
The Vagrant tells the story of Graham Krackowski (the always magnificent Paxton), who moves into his new home only to be terrorized by an unruly vagrant that lives across the street in an abandon lot. What begins as simply an inconvenience to him, escalates into an all out war of head games, wit, and eventually murder.
Graham is content! He has a just purchased a new house which he can afford due to his successful well okay job which also comes closer to him with a swell chance of picking up a great girlfriend as a bonus feature. Of course he is something of a suck up yuppie and his potential companion Judy Dansig is sex-crazed real estate agent. However his new home has unwanted guest, a disgraced destitute shrink, who sees a chance to carry on the mind games that led him to his current situation. As Graham starts finding pieces of those around him turning up in places like his fridge and with him getting the blame by the law. Graham struggles hard not to lose it, but that isn't easy as the deaths continue and he starts to even doubt his very own sanity!
