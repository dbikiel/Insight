Dr. Peter Roland, a Geneva TV reporter and prankster, is ordered as punishment to cover the German schools. So he cheats his brother in law William 'Willy' Tell to steal his identity as exchange program teacher in Mommsen gymnasium (classical high school) in Baden-Baden (SW Germany). There he's assigned to class 10a, where local businessman Kurt Notnagel's son Pepe rules the pranking roost. Instead of siding with principal Dr. Gottlieb Taft's staff, he can't resist teaming up with Pepe, whose sister Marion digs slick Peter.
