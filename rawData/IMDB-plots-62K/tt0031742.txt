Two itinerant migrant workers, one mentally disabled and the other his carer, take jobs as ranch hands during the Great Depression to fulfill their shared dream of owning their own ranch.
George Milton and Lennie Small are migrant workers in the 1930s Depression. Lennie is mentally disabled and George looks after him. While working as hands on a Western ranch, they dream of owning their own ranch and the opportunity may be available. Their current ranch is owned by a sadistic man who has a flirtatious wife.
A man with the size and strength of a giant but the mind of a child, and his level-headed friend wander around Central California looking for work, only to end up at a ranch owned by a man whose sadistic son and flirtatious daughter-in-law ruin things for everyone.
George and half-wit Lennie work on a western ranch during the Great Depression, dreaming of the autonomy of owning and operating their own ranch some day.
