Mother rabbit sends her charges off to school. Peter needs a bit more attention; he's hiding with the chickens, using a feather duster to stand in for a tail. On his way to school, Peter starts to sneak into a farmer's field, but is caught by three schoolmates. They threaten to tell the teacher, and Peter heads off to school. The bell rings, and Peter decides to cut class and attack the field. Carrots and beans (which prove to be Mexican jumping beans) pose no problem, but a row of beets proves stubborn. Peter uses the rope and winch from the farmer's well to haul them out, but the farmer's cow, munching on the other end of the row, lands in the well, and its bleats alert the farmer. Peter runs, and rides atop the farmer's mower to escape him. After damaging the flowers, hedges, and corn, he runs through a stand of maple trees with out-of-season sap/syrup, then a chicken coop, leaving him coated in feathers. He perches on a fence post and crows.
