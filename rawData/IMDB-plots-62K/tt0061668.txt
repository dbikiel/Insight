A successful business man occasionally develops an unusual physical disturbance: his nose whistles, whenever he breathes. Because of this peculiar circumstance, he enters a private, luxurious hospital. The whistle is cured, but new problems, real or unreal, are discovered by the hospital's staff. The man loses his confidence and vitality progressively. In a steady progression, he is first requested, then forced to move from one floor to another. Each floor is less elegant than the lower one, the staff is less appealing and courteous, the independence of the man reduced. At last, he has only the caring company of his lover to comfort him, amidst the indifference of his family.
