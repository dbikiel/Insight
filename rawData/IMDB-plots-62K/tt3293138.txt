A Â£25,000 reward offered by a local newspaper brings documentary makers Matt and his girlfriend Georgia to the remote North Devon moor in a bid to capture the fabled Beast purported to be a wild cat, like a panther or a puma on film.
A pair of documentarians head into the woods of the Exmoor countryside to find proof of the mysterious big cats that roam the area. But what they find in the depths of the forest is a horror beyond imagine. They must fight tooth and nail to survive or fall prey to what lurks in the darkness.
The impulsive and beautiful Georgia drags her unwilling boyfriend Matt to the remote English countryside to prove the existence of the legendary Beast of Exmoor. Armed with cameras, they meet Fox, an eccentric hunter with over 20 years hunting experience who has agreed to act as their guide - and believes the beast has tasted human flesh and hungers for more.
