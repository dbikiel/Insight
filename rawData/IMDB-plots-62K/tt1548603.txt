Grandson of a rugby legend, son of a rugby legend and himself a rugby legend, Jo Canavaro brings up his 13 year old son, Tom, alone in a small village in the Tarn region of France. To the great shame of Jo, Tom is as excellent at maths as he is useless on the field. For a Canavaro, the legend can't stop here. He is prepared to create a rugby team for Tom against the will of the entire village and Tom himself.
