A force of loners and fighters is put together to try and rescue Generals that are captured by the Japanese and save the war effort with the promise of gold and/or pardons of past crimes.
Similar to "The Dirty Dozen" or one of that nature. Japan is trying to take over the world and the generals of the allied forces trying to stop the Japanese have been taken prisoner. A force of loners and fighters is put together to try and rescue the generals and save the war effort with the promise of gold and/or pardons of past crimes.
Set at some point during the thirties or forties, Japan is at war with China. During an attack on the Chinese forces, the Japanese capture four Western Generals. Fearing that if this news were to reach their troops it would affect their morale greatly, the Chinese hire Captain Don Wen to form a commando squad and get the Generals back in four days. Don decides to regroup his old squad (consisting of thief Old Sun, escape artist Grease Lightning, con artist Billy and his ex-girlfriend Lily, the bumbling and apparently unnamed General and his buddy Stone) one last time to get the Generals back. Don is apparently killed in an attack but the group continues on regardless, with the aid of ex-wrestler Sammy and his former manager Emily who trail the group to make sure they stay alive, so they'll have a share of the reward. Towards the end, the previously comical film takes a bizarre turn and climaxes at a Japanese bunker where the group go kamikaze and fight off a small army in the hope that the last survivor will be able to claim the reward. But are the Japanese the only villains?
