Hugh Mitchell is campaigning for Mayor of Lawtonville against the incumbent, Fulderwilder, but his having trouble with his son, Danny, who persists in telling lies. Trouble starts brewing when Danny, who is "assisting" the town's new doctor, Antonia Cordell, slips his father's campaign handbills into the envelopes containing the doctor's announcement cards. Mayor Fulderwilder accuses Mitchell of complicity in the affair.
Hugh Mitchell, who is running for mayor of Lawtonville against incumbent Mayor Fulderwilder, is having problems at home with his young teen son, Danny Mitchell. Hugh has had to punish Danny for lying, the punishment which has placed a wedge between the two. Meanwhile, Hugh has convinced his old girlfriend, Dr. Antonia Cordell to come to Lawtonville to relieve temporarily the town's doctor, this action with the blessing of Hugh's wife and Danny's stepmother, Ethel Mitchell, who knows of Toni and Hugh's past. Aspiring veterinarian Danny, whose chosen future career is in large part because of his love for his German Shepard dog Rusty, is glad to be able to assist who he calls Dr. Toni in her work. One of Dr. Toni's first set of cases is a number of the town's boys coming down with the same ailment, which she believes is caused by a water borne bacteria or virus, perhaps from the town's clean water supply. If it is from the town's water supply, it could cause a major scandal for Mayor Fulderwilder. Dr. Toni plans on testing the water from a number of sites, including all those infected boys' homes. But a further lie told by Danny - told out of fear - combined with an earlier misstep he made in his father's mayoral campaign, could lead to the good names of several of the townsfolk being tarnished, Hugh's chances for election being ruined, and irreparable damage being done in the father-son relationship, the latter especially as Hugh is exasperated in not knowing how else to deal with Danny about the lying.
