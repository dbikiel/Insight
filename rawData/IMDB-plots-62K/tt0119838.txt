A cinematic portrait of the famous fight promoter and boxing manager.
Don King is involved in two fistfights that result in the deaths of his combatants, and, after serving prison time, enters the world of professional boxing. Chatty, with a memorable head of hair, King becomes the promoter for Muhammad Ali and other champions, and he stages lucrative boxing spectacles in the Philippines, Zaire, Atlantic City, Reno and Las Vegas. Despite King's success, he's beset by critics who say he cons his fighters out of their ring earnings.
Biography of fight promoter Don King follows his rise from a street goon convicted of strong arm tactics to a minor music promoter to pulling off his first major fight with Muhammad Ali for a charity. Ving Rhames characterization gives a fully three dimensional person with warts and all, but still makes it understandable how he became the affluent promoter he has become.
