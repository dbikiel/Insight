Thanks to a strange crystal, a shy student finds himself in the Stone Age, where he falls in love with a beautiful cave woman and helps her clan stave off a tribe of cannibals.
On a class excursion to a cave with stone age paintings the clumsy Rex gets lost. A mysterious crystal opens a gateway in time and sets him back to the stone ages, where he meets a group of prehistoric fellows and the gorgeous Eba. While teaching her English and doing some pseudo-research on her fellows, his main goal is to get her sleeping with him. However the curiosity of the clan chief disturbs his attempts.
