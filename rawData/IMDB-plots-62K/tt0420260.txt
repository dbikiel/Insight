When technical illustrator Tony Takitani asks his wife to resist her all-consuming obsession for designer clothes, the consequences are tragic.
Due to his Western name, Tony was shunned by other kids and spent a solitary childhood. Though gifted as an artist, his drawings lacked feeling, so as an adult, he carved a career as a technical illustrator. Then in middle age, Tony suddenly falls for a pretty young woman, Eiko Konuma, who visits him one day on business. Eiko is like an angel in Tony's daily existence, and for the first time in his life, he feels connected to the outside world. However, Eiko does have one fault: she's a clothing shopaholic. Confusion also begins to develop when it appears that Eiko has a double.
Tony Takitani (Issei Ogata) has been alone all his life. His mother died when he was quite young, and his father (also Issei Ogata) was mostly absent with a jazz band. Hence he became introspective and taciturn, rarely displaying emotion. He discovers he has a gift for drawing and develops a successful career as a technical illustrator. He develops an obsession for Eiko (Ria Miazawa). For him, she's the perfect shoe size and clothes horse. He marries her. However she has her own obsession with designer clothes which brings about her destruction. A disconsolate Tony then discovers Hisako (also played by Ria Miazawa) who has an uncanny resemblance to Eiko. He begins to groom her, but can't complete his creation.
