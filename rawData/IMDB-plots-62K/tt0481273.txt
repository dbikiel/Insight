A confident, out-of-the-closet gay teenager has the support of an eclectic range of friends while dealing with a homophobic bully during his first year at an international high school.
Chance Marquis, a confident, self-assured, quick-witted, perceptive, outspoken and clear-headed gay teenager, reflects back on his first year at an international high school. While meeting and making friends with an assortment of types, he also has the targeted attentions of a mirthless vice principal and a bullying, homophobic soccer jock out to make his life miserable. At home, Chance's perceptive little sister openly shares all his confidential secrets with their widowed career-army father seeking common ground with his atypical children. Introduced to a drag club, Chance finds fun and success in a cross-dressing contest, but a photo of his participation makes life at a school a living hell. Time to find out the depths of your friendships.
High school coming-of-age tale. It is the 1980's -- and new wave angst and gender-bending fashion are all the rage. The new kid at school, Chance Marquis is a somewhat awkward teenager who is the target of the school bully. To deal with this dilemma, Chance turns to the opposite ends of the high school spectrum for help. On one end is the flamboyant drag queen and at the other end, the varsity jock. Includes conventions of the high school genre -- the idiot faculty, the good-hearted but misguided parents, the fairy tale reversal of popularity.
