A documentary on 85-year-old sushi master Jiro Ono, his renowned Tokyo restaurant, and his relationship with his son and eventual heir, Yoshikazu.
In the basement of a Tokyo office building, 85 year old sushi master Jiro Ono works tirelessly in his world renowned restaurant, Sukiyabashi Jiro. As his son Yoshikazu faces the pressures of stepping into his father's shoes and taking over the legendary restaurant, Jiro relentlessly pursues his lifelong quest to create the perfect piece of sushi.
A profile of eighty-five year old sushi chef Jiro Ono is presented, his small ten seat Tokyo sushi bar with its washroom facilities located outside the building and where only sushi is served being designated three star Michelin for its consistent excellence. Jiro basically lives, eats and sleeps sushi, with perfection not his goal, but being better tomorrow than today is. Among his philosophies is that simplicity is key, sushi must be eaten immediately after it's made, repetition of tasks leads to excellence over time, all components of the food, whether it be the fish, the rice or the nori, are equally important, and it is the combination and the flow of that make for a great dining experience. As such, he ultimately has to trust his small supply of vendors and those who work for him, the latter group who have all been taught by him. Among that latter group is his eldest son, fifty-something Yoshikazu Ono, who was predestined to be Jiro's heir apparent regardless of what Yoshikazu himself wanted for his life. While he seems to have eventually embraced life as a sushi chef himself, only Yoshikazu can decide what his future holds when Jiro ultimately retires, which may more difficult to match in only having to live up to a legacy. Jiro's younger son, Takashi Ono, is also presented, he also a sushi chef and taught by Jiro, but who has opened his own Toyko restaurant in understanding the Japanese way of whatever built by Jiro being passed onto the eldest, Yoshikazu.
