At a Mexican ranch, fugitive O'Malley and pursuing Sheriff Stribling agree to help rancher Breckenridge drive his herd into Texas where Stribling could legally arrest O'Malley, but Breckenridge's wife complicates things.
Brendan O'Malley arrives at the Mexican home of old flame Belle Breckenridge to find her married to a drunkard getting ready for a cattle drive to Texas. Hot on O'Malley's heels is lawman Dana Stribling who has a personal reason for getting him back into his jurisdiction. Both men join Breckenridge and his wife on the drive. As they near Texas tensions mount, not least because Stribling is starting to court Belle and O'Malley is increasingly drawn by her daughter Missy.
The gunman, Brendan O'Malley, crosses the border into Mexico and arrives at the ranch of Belle Breckenridge. He asks to spend the night there, and meets her daughter Melissa. Belle was his sweetheart, and now is married to the drunkard and coward John Breckenridge, but O'Malley still has a crush on her. John hires O'Malley to lead his herd to Texas. However, Sheriff Dana Stribling is hunting O'Malley to serve a warrant for the death of his brother-in-law, and also arrives on the farm, where he does not have jurisdiction to arrest O'Malley. Stribling also agrees to work for John, bringing the cattle to Texas, and promises to deliver O'Malley to the law in the arrival.
