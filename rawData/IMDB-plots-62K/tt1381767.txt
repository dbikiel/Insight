Carrie is a big-city teenager whose life is turned upside down when she moves to a horse ranch in Wyoming to live with her father. But everything changes when Carrie meets Flicka, a wild, jet-black mustang who's just as free-spirited and strong-willed as Carrie. The two form a special bond and Carrie opens her heart to her father and a handsome, local boy, but when a jealous rival puts Flicka's life in jeopardy, Carrie must do whatever it takes to save her best friend.
Hank McLaughlin, who inherited and runs his brother's Wyoming ranch, only meets his teen daughter Carrie when the city grandmother who raised since her mother's death falls too ill. The brat is hostile to the father who never got a chance to learn how to become one and hates rustic 'hick' life. Having been saved from a rattle snake bite by the bitten, untamed mustang Flicka, whom only her cousin ever rode, she bonds with her over a taxing recovery process. Cute, patient juvenile ranch-hand Jake, who dreams of a Nashville country career and his own ranch, bonds as her riding instructor and only friend. She meanly dumps him, jealous of rich neighbor rancher HD Walker's dressage champion daughter Amy's bond with him. Tragedy lures as Flicka gets away and into great trouble, and soon Carrie.
