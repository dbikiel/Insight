On October 15, 2011, as part of the wave of protests that followed the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street, Slovenian activists occupied a square in front of the Ljubljana stock exchange, setting up tents and remaining there through the winter. "A Fight for" depicts the life of protesters in the camp, from the erection of the first tent to its dismantling six months later.
