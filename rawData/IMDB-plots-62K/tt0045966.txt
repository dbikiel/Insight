King Arthur's rule is threatened by the adulterous love between Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere, a relationship the king's enemies hope to exploit.
King Arthur establishes the greatest reign England has ever seen, and along for the ride are his indispensable Knights of the Round Table, particularly Sir Lancelot. Then, Arthur finds himself a bride, the beautiful Guenivere. While she loves Arthur, she also loves Lancelot and though Lancelot repeatedly fights it, he loves her, too. Treachery is brewing as the evil Morgan le Fay and her knight Sir Modred work to trap them. So begins the decline and eventual fall of Arthur and Camelot.
Sir Lancelot travels from France to pledge his allegiance to Arthur Pendragon, whose fame has spread far and wide. Arthur is named king after he draws the sword Excalibur from the stone in which his father had placed it. Arther isn't the only claimant to rule as Mordred also has his eye on the throne. Sir Lancelot is immediately attracted to a beautiful woman not realizing she is Guinevere and promised to Arthur. He is loyal and true to his King. Mordred takes advantage of the situation but his treachery is uncovered in the end. It does not lead to a happy ending however.
