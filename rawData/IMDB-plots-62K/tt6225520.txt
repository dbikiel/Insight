The journey that led to Charles Dickens' creation of "A Christmas Carol," a timeless tale that would redefine Christmas.
In 1843, the celebrated British novelist, Charles Dickens, is at a low point in his career with three flops behind him and his family expenses piling up at home. Determined to recover, Dickens decides to write a Christmas story and self-publish it in less than two months.
