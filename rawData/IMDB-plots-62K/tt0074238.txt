The Mafia tries to take revenge against a man who testified against them in court.
Vincent Karbone is a leading construction magnate in Philadelphia and a suspected leader of one of the city's most notorious criminal gangs. Several of his thugs are on trial, and the key witness is Michael, a mild-mannered judo instructor with a wife and kids. Karbone will stop at nothing to keep the muscles of his organization out of prison, including striking at Michael's family to keep him from testifying.
