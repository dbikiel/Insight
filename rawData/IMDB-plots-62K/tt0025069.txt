The Stann family gives a small party prior to daughter Bernice's marriage to socialite Monty, but all of the guests seem to be against the match.
Wonderful idea to give a party with people who dislike each other. Late at night, everyone decides to go into the pool, except Stamm, who is drunk. Montague dives in as does Greeff and Leland, but only Greeff and Leland come out. Montague is no where to be found so Leland suspects foul play and calls the cops. Luckily, Philo is with the D.A. and comes along, but they do not find Montague. When they drain the pool the next day, they find nothing except what looks like dragon prints. Philo has his suspicions and tries to piece the clues together to find out what has happened.
Detective Philo Vance is called in on a police case in which socialite Montague has mysteriously drowned in a backyard pool at a party held at the mansion of his fiancee Bernice Stamm and her wealthy brother Rudolph. Things take an eerie turn when Vance learns from insane, elderly Mrs. Stamm that the naturally-formed pool was called the 'dragon pool' by the original inhabitants of the land and that it harbors a killer dragon.
