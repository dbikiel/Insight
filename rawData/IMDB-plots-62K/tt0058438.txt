A new priest comes to a little town causing discomfort to parishioners.
Father Sebastián (Cantinflas), is assigned as the new priest in a small Mexican town, but the parishioners prefer father Damián (Ángel Garasa) the old priest they have, who is about to retire. With time father Sebastián will gain the hearts and love from the town folks.
