As the sheriff of a small western town, Autry sings his way into a relationship with Eleanor, a singer from a Chicago nightclub who earlier witnessed a murder.
Nightclub singer Eleanor Spencer (Irene Manning as Hope Manning) flees Chicago after witnesses a murder committed by her boss, gangster Mike Scarlotti. Arriving out west in Turquoise City, supposedly incognito, but with her pictures in newspapers coast-to-coasts she is recognized by crooked nightclub-owner Martin Simms ( Keefe) who hires her, using the name of Jane Edwards, to sing in his joint while he notifies Scarlotti of her whereabouts hoping to collect a reward from the Gangster. The latter wastes no time getting there since she was the only witness to his crime and he wants to get her before the police do. Singing Sheriff Gene Autry (Gene Autry), already troubled by the O'Keefe Brothers, and his deputy Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette) come to Eleanor's aid and round-up the gangsters during a wild cattle stampede.
After seeing gangster Scarlotti murder a man, Eleanor Spenser heads west. Recognizing her by her picture in the paper, the local saloon owner hires her and also informs Scarlotti. Scarlotti arrives to get rid of Eleanor but Sheriff Autry has also seen the picture and he sets out to not only protect her but to also get Scarlotti.
