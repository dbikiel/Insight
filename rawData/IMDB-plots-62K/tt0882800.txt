Van Erp shows us what the Dutch do in their spare time and takes a look at the industry behind all these leisure activities.
Van Erp displays the mechanics behind the Dutch tourism industry. Key figures behind events and destinations are followed, like the manager of Zutphen city promotion in his attempt to lure more tourists, the Efteling theme park director working on the latest attraction and the manager of Batavia Stad outlet store running the Christmas sale. With his traditional tongue-in-cheek style, he gives a good view on what happens behind the scenes of "a day out".
