Profiling the cross-demographic fanaticism for the ostensibly girl-orientated television series, My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic (2010).
In 2010, producer Lauren Faust reworked the notoriously sexist My Little Pony franchise to attempt a quality TV series for both girls and their parents to enjoy, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. As it turns out, Faust succeeded beyond anyone's expectations with an acclaimed hit that also created an adult and teen male fandom no one saw coming, the Bronies. This film explores this following with a look at the franchise, the lives of particular fans around the world and the creative passions their seemingly unusual interest inspires. Although sometimes troubled by the prejudice of others, these kindred spirits enjoy a community experience both in spirit and at conventions that has a special magic all its own.
