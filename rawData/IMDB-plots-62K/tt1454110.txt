A fantastical - but factual - journey to the Centre of the Earth.
What would you see if you cracked open the Earth and peered into its core? This DSC special provides a pretty good idea, employing jaw-dropping visual effects to conjure up one of man's final frontiers . Seams of iron ore, diamond caverns and tantalizing glimpses of the magnetic fields that protect us from the radiation found in space are among the startling vistas offered in this journey to the center of the earth.
