The film is NOT about someone "looking for a lost sister". The director, Petra Costa, is Elena's younger sister, who became a filmmaker. The film is a true story, a documentary that recreates her Elena's steps, using childhood memories, home videos, photos and interviews.
This documentary can be hard to comprehend without this synopsis. Elena goes to NYC to follow in her mother's footsteps to find work as an actor. The narrator is Elena's younger sister Petra who remembers Elena via her video recordings and then follows her to NYC to look for her.
