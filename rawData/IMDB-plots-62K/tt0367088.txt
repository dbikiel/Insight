Minkey, a super-spy primate, and his partner Mike were the two best spies in the business. For years, they made every mission possible... But when Mike retired to raise his baby girl, Amelia, he never predicted that life would come full circle. Ten years later, Amelia -- who has invented a revolutionary chemical drill -- is kidnapped and whisked off to Japan by her hero, Dr. Farley, who is planning a highly dangerous experiment that could cause a massive earthquake and destroy the entire world. Mike and Minkey partner up one last time for their most important mission ever: saving Amelia -- and the world -- from the clutches of the evil Dr. Farley.
