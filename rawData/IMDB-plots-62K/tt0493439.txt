A lurid, dark look into the lives of sex workers, where victims of child abuse deal with the consequences later in life.
In Los Angeles, Jaron "Jizz" is a needy teenager that was molested when he was a child and works publishing advertisements for the sex industry. He discounts one hundred dollars in his paychecks to release Tara, who works in a peep-show in Paulie's, for the powerful lord of the sex industry Jimmy Sours. He teams-up with the whore Balery, who is seeking out a partner to steal from a rich client, to raise the necessary money to pay Jimmy. Mr. Garrett is the perverted Health teacher of a high-school; his sluttish students Melody and Courtney like to tease him, crossing their legs while wearing mini-skirts to see him masturbating in his car. Mr. Garrett takes them to join the Internet porn industry and to use pills, and Melody is raped by the sick teacher. The escort Chantel attends kinky clients to satisfy their fantasies and is protected by her pimp Wes. When Wes tries to force the entry in a client's house, the man reacts and the lives of the lead characters are entwined in a tragedy.
