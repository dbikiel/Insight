This raunchy horror comedy delves deep into the story of a deranged killer as he slashes his way across a soft core porno. Who will last the longest as the stiffs pile up and the killer plows through his victims?
Deep Murder is a genre-bending horror comedy that takes place inside the world of a softcore porn. It begins like any other porno, with a group of horny archetypes holed up in a poorly decorated house. But when they begin to be brutally murdered one by one, they're forced to evolve from clich√©s into real people in order to catch the killer in their midst and survive the night.
