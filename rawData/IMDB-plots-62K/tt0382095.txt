An 11 year old talented soccerplayer, Remco, has one big dream: to be selected for the national team under 12 years. His father Erik coaches him and everything seems to work out fine, until Erik suddenly dies. Remco and mother Sylvia are shocked. Remco keeps working to fulfil his dream, being helped by his friends Anne and Winston.
Dutch school boy Remko Van Leeuwen inherited the talent and passion for soccer from his dad, know-it-all grocer Erik, whose career went with his knee. As the 11 year-old's hero, his father can get away with demanding the impossible, but cardiac problems kill him unexpectedly. Without his father, coach, role model and other male Remko is stuck with ma, who takes to the accountant Arend, who helps out with the shop, and kid sister. He's desperate enough to lose interest in his promising soccer future until after a voodoo s√©ance his dad seems to appear every time he plays soccer again. Now they brave even a worrisome ankle injury, helped by a pharmacist's daughter in his class who wants his kisses at any price. Ma poses just as great a mental obstacle.
