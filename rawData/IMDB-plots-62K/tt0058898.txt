A U.S. secret agent is sent to the distant space city of Alphaville where he must find a missing person and free the city from its tyrannical ruler.
Lemmy Caution, an American private-eye, arrives in Alphaville, a futuristic city on another planet. His very American character is at odds with the city's ruler, an evil scientist named Von Braun, who has outlawed love and self-expression.
In a near future, the American secret agent Lemmy Caution travels to Alphaville posing as the journalist Ivan Johnson from the Figaro-Pravda newspaper. His mission is to find the missing agent Henry Dickson and to convince Professor von Braun to come with him to Nueva York. Prof. von Braun is actually Leonard Nosferatu and has created the powerful computer Alpha 60 that has conceived the inhuman dystopian society of Alphaville, where love, conscience, poetry and emotion have been banished and words are systematically eliminated from the dictionary. Alpha 60 is also omnipresent and Lemmy has the assistance of Natacha von Braun, who is the daughter of von Braun. Soon he falls in love with Natacha but he needs to complete his mission before leaving Alphaville.
A man arrives in a hotel very possessive about his white suitcase. This is Lemmy Caution (Eddie Constantine), an American private-eye, and he has arrived in Alphaville, a futuristic city on another planet.Here he meets Natacha von Braun (Anna Karina) and tried to arrange an interview with her father, saying he is a journalist.In the Red Star hotel he meets Henri Dickson (Akim Tamiroff), who tells him that there used to be artists, musicians et.c but today nothing at all.FULL TRANSCRIPT:Sometimes ...reality is too complex for oral communication
But legend embodies it in a form which enables it to spread all over the world
It was 24.17 Oceanic Time ...when I approached the suburbs of Alphaville

Scene:
Hotel
Johnson:My paper reserved a room for me: Ivan Johnson
-Which paper?
-Figaro-Pravda
Clerk: Room 344. Have you registered at Residents' Control?
You must, even if you're a Festival visitor
Johnson: Clear off!
Seductress: You're tired, sir?
You'd like to sleep, sir?
If you're tired, you can rest, sir.
The bedroom's here
[Johnson checks the walls]
Seductress: I'm checking if the Bible's here
-Do you believe in all that?
-Of course.
Seductress: I'll put the tranquilizers in the bathroom
I'm very well, thank you, you're welcome
Seductress: -Will you take a bath?
-Yes, I must think.
I'll help you, sir
I'll take your tie, sir
Johnson: Now what?
Seductress: I'll bathe you, if you like, sir
Johnson: I'm a big boy, sweetie; I can find my own dames
Clear off!
[Spy concealed in bathroom:] Be polite to the ladies, Mister Johnson
Johnson: Bloody hell, now what?
Spy: Don't you fancy this kid?
Johnson: How about your sister, Mister?
[Johnson kills spy]
I'm getting rusty
What's the game? Are you on narcotics?
Seductress: No, it's just normal
Johnson: Everything weird is "normal" in this hole
Sit in that chair
[Johnson takes photograph of Seductress]
Her name was Beatrice
She said she was a Seductress, Third Class
I was struck by her sad, yet hard, face
Something's not in orbit in the capital of this Galaxy
Johnson: Hold this up
[Johnson shoots a hole through each breast in a Vargas painting in magazine]
Johnson: Not bad for a veteran of Guadalcanal
Seductress: Just what I was thinking about you
Johnson: Go play your record elsewhere; I've heard it before
Yes?
[Voice:] Mister Johnson
Miss Natasha Vonbraun...
...has called for you
Johnson: Just a moment
[photo on bed: Leonard Vonbraun; bring back alive, or liquidate]
Johnson: Tell her I'll come down
[Voice:] She's on her way up
[photo on bed: Henry Dickson. Agent X21. 12, Enrico Fermi. Alphaville.]
Natasha: Got a light?
Johnson: I've traveled 9,000 kilometers to give it to you
Natasha: I'm Natasha Vonbraun
Johnson: Yes, I know
Natasha: How do you know?
Johnson: Miss Vonbraun?
Natasha: Yes, I'm very well, thank you, you're welcome
You've come from the Lands Without?
Johnson: Yes
Natasha: Everything to your satisfaction?
Johnson: Yes
Natasha: I've been ordered to remain at your service during your stay
Johnson: Who ordered you?
Natasha: The authorities, of course
Are you here for the Festival?
Johnson: Which Festival?
Natasha: The big one; that's what people from the Lands Without come for
It was silly not to have come earlier
The Festival's nearly over; it's the last till next year
Johnson: You don't say
Natasha: Yes, Mister Johnson
But this evening there is a Reception-Gala Performance
Very big
At a ministry. I'm going; come if you like
Johnson: What time? I must attend to something else first
Natasha: Residents' Control registration?
Johnson: No. What's that?
Natasha: You mustn't forget to go there. We can meet afterwards
Johnson: I'll go there tomorrow. First I must meet a friend
Natasha: I've work, too
I'll tell you where I'll be
Call for me and we'll go on together
See you in an hour or two
Johnson: See you then
I'll go down with you
Natasha: Mister Johnson, what's it like in the Lands Without?
Johnson: Haven't you been there?
Natasha: No, but my father told me about them when I was little
Now it's forbidden to think about them
Johnson: Are you often ordered to spend your time with strangers?
Natasha: Yes, it's my job
Johnson: How nice for you. Aren't you ever propositioned?
Natasha: What?
Johnson: Has no one ever fallen in love with you?
Natasha: In love? What's that?
Johnson: There's one thing I'd like to know
Natasha: Yes, Mister Johnson?
Johnson: Just how big of a fool do you take me for?
Answer me
Natasha: I can't understand what you're talking about
Johnson: Check, Princess! I can't make head or tail of what you're talking about
That's how it is, you never understand anything
Yes, that's always how it is; you never understand anything
Until one fine day you die of it
Scene:
Hotel Lobby
Natasha: Which way are you going?
Johnson: 12, Enrico Fermi
Near Heisenberg Boulevard, near Mathematical Park
Natasha: I can give you a lift
I'll get the keys
I'm very well, thank you, you're welcome
Johnson: You don't want me to flirt with you?
Natasha: What?
Johnson: You really don't know what it means?
[nods yes]
Her smile and her small pointed teeth...
...reminded me of an old vampire film...
...the sort they used to show at cinerama museums
[car drives away]
Natasha: I'm a Programmer, Second Class
Johnson: Natasha's a name from the past
Natasha: Yes, but...
...the present is all one can know in life
No one's lived in the past, or will live in the future
Johnson: Thanks for the lift, anyway
Natasha: It's a pleasure to do my job, Mister Johnson
Johnson: Is it much farther?
[Driver:] You know we must cross the north zone, Miss?
Johnson: What's the population?
Natasha: Don't forget, you must go to Residents' Control
What exactly do you do for a living?
Johnson: I work
For a newspaper

It's vital that I write about him; can you arrange an interview?
