Young and handsome Sergio works the night shift as a trash collector in Lisbon, Portugal. He can't force himself to connect with his pretty female co-worker Fatima, who displays an avid interest in him, so instead Sergio roams the city with the trash company's pet dog. Eventually Sergio becomes fascinated with a sleek motorcycle, and then also its owner, João - a young man totally indifferent to Sergio. The frustrated trash collector's surfacing sexual desires unleash his darkest impulses, sending him down a dangerous path of violence, depravity and degradation.
Sérgio is a homosexual garbage collector, living alone with his dog and having a promiscuous life. Fátima, who also works with him, has a kind of sexual attraction for him, but he is not interested in her, becoming obsessed with another guy.
