Imbued Life is a film about a young woman's connection with the life force of nature. She uses her talent for taxidermy to "return" the animals to their natural habitat. However, the true search for the answers begins when she starts finding a roll of undeveloped film in each of the animals she treats. Her obsession drives her to seek the explanation of the connection she feels, haunting her dreams, as well as her waking moments.
