Pierre Verger is a quick-tempered Paris taxi driver (excuse the pleonasm!). On the other hand , he is a good family man concerned about his nearest and dearest. Married to Hélène, he has two children, Georges, a journalist and womanizer, and Jacqueline, a seamstress, engaged to a serious-minded, naive artist/delivery man. He has also a a brother-in-law, who is a policeman outside home and a henpecked husband inside. But his closest companion is "Gangster", a young dog, who shares his days of work as well as his aversion to law enforcers. Pierre's main preoccupation is to provide his next of kin with a comfortable life but he finds it hard to make ends meet. This is the reason why he is faced with a moral dilemma when a client, an Italian woman whose address he can't find, leaves her bag in his taxi with 300,000 francs in it. Will usually honest Pierre keep this large sum of money or bring it to the police?
