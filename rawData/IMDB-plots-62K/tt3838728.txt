In the well-to-do suburbs of a small town, a group of pretty average, well-adjusted sixteen and seventeen year olds are ordinary adolescents who take a singular path.
In a small town of France, life seems to be boring for a group of teenage friends who--day in, day out--are asked to cope not only with the usual issues in the life of a high-school student but also with the restless search for love and sex. Under those circumstances, when an innocent game of truth or dare on a Saturday night party rapidly transforms into a mandatory, dare only, series of sexy challenges between friends, the means to unfold one's true self, and the hidden potential in everyone present will be evident. Before long, alcohol and a few drugs will give birth to the new "Bang Gang" revolution; nevertheless, what deceptively appears as a way to deal with boredom, strained family relationships, emancipation--and above all--personal liberty, will quickly turn into the biggest scandal, and a mockery of a modern fairy tale.
