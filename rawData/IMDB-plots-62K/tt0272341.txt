The Biblical story of David and Goliath, with a cast of vegetables.
Dave, upset over not being allowed to join his brothers who have all gone off to war, is resigned to staying at home and taking care of the farm. When a giant pickle is sent to attack his village, Dave relies on God's teachings, and his own self-esteem, to fight the monster.
