An experimental music video about a wheelchair-bound boy who morphs and moves to an Aphex Twin song. The experience gets weirder when he takes cocaine and everything gets out of control.
The title character is a boy whose bizarre skills frighten his caregivers. Due to his ability to contort his body into unnatural positions, he is kept locked in the family basement. With nothing more than a vivid imagination and a pitiful pet dog, he attempts to keep himself entertained.
