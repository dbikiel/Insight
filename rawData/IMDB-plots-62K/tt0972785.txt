At Camp Spirit Thunder, high school cheer leaders compete. The red team/Sharks' cutie, Carson, and blue team/Jets' hunk, Penn, are in love. Does that make them archenemies like the Sharks and Jets?
Southern California high school senior Carson arrives at the all-important "Cheer Camp Nationals" determined to lead her squad, the West High Sharks, to victory. But chic New Yorker Brooke and her team, the East High Jets, are equally steadfast in their pursuit of the competition's coveted "Spirit Stick." As tension mounts between the two rival squads, Carson falls for fellow cheerleader Penn, not realizing he's a Jet. When Brooke discovers the budding romance, she raises the stakes by challenging Carson to a one-on-one cheer-off. A spectacular "cheer fighting" sequence erupts into a no-holds-barred brawl and cheerleaders on both sides are suspended from the competition. With their dreams of taking home the top prize all but shattered, the leaders of both squads realize they'll have to take drastic measures to stay in the game.
Fourth 'Bring It On' movie is set at a cheerleader camp in Florida with a 'West Side Story' musical feel has the female captain of the West Side Sharks meeting and romancing a male member of the East Coast Jets amid their different team rivalries.
Macho army general's brat Penn told neither the team about his background nor his old man that his hobby isn't martial arts but cheer-leading. On camp for the selection of teams to participate in the national final, Jet Penn falls in love with Carson, the captain of a Californian rival team, who soon thinks he hid his identity so he could spy on her, maybe even steal the legendary baton, which each team is to guard for one night. It disappears while they sneaked out to a fun fair, and the alleged bad lucks seems to befall all camp, until a radical solution is found: combining the remaining champions from both rival teams.
