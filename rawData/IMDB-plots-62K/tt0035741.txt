Muggs' rich Uncle Pete is coming to visit. Unfortunately, Muggs' late father had bragged that he had seven kids, so Muggs recruits the members of the gang to pose as his family--including Glimpy as his sister, "Annabelle." Things turn sour, however, when a local mobster finds out about Muggs' deception and threatens to expose it.
