An unemployed man finds his life sinking more and more into trouble as he hides his situation from his family and friends.
Recently fired from his job, but unable to confess the truth to his close-knit family, Vincent spends his days driving around the countryside, talking into his cell phone and staring into space. Vincent fabricates a new job for himself so his family and friends will not know that he is out of work. At one point, he even sneaks into an office building. As Vincent roams the building's sterile halls, peeking into meeting rooms where men are busy at work, we see a man who yearns not just for a new job, but also for a place in the world. While this pantomime of work initially registers as sad and even a little pathetic, it slowly and unnervingly becomes terrifying.
Vincent, a corporate consultant, has been fired but doesn't tell his wife and three children. Instead he goes out on long, hypnotic drives to Switzerland where he sleeps in his car, wanders hotels and corporate headquarters, and eventually pretends to be working at an important new job for the UN. This life seems to suit him more than his real job ever did. Later to make up for his lack of income he develops a scam whereby he gets friends and former coworkers to donate money expecting a quick return on investments in the Third World. A shipper of illegal imports and knockoffs spots Vincent and recruits him to help with his business. Family and friends eventually realize they're being duped and Vincent is in all kinds of deep trouble, but the ending is not what one would expect.
The story of a French every-man who has lost his job and finds himself taken up in an increasingly large web of lies to keep the fact hidden from family and friends.
