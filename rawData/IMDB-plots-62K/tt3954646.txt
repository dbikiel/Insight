This time, horror comes fron the other side.
A five year old boy, chronically abused by his father, develops dissociative disorder and a separate identity as a coping mechanism. As a young adult in psychotherapy, he realizes Alex's role in his life and suspects her (himself) of killing his father. His savior and only friend become a nightmare he battles to rid himself of.
