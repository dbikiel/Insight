A dysfunctional middle class family avoids their issues. Miguel wants to pay their immigrant teen maid Ana for sex, his wife Alice has an affair with their teen son's manipulative schoolmate and Miguel's parents deal with Alzheimer's.
Maria suffers from Alzheimer's disease. Luis, Maria's fifteen-year-old grandson, doesn't say very much either; he shuts himself off in his own silent world to escape his parent's marital crisis, spending time instead picking up stray cats and dogs off the street. His father, Miguel, wants to put a stop to this eccentric behavior, but his protective mother Alice indulges him. Nevertheless, the animals begin to appear at home in increasing numbers, making life complicated for the family in their flat.
A well-off family, unmistakeably urban, is trapped in the small world they have built at their measure. Each member of the family is fighting alone to rescue whatever can justify them. Luis goes through his teenage years discovering around him men and women who are both guilty and innocent.
