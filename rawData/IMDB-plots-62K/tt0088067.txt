A detective investigating a series of murders discovers that they are similar to the slayings that occur in the new script of a Hollywood screenwriter.
This is the story of aspiring sreenwriter Edgar Allen (Rufus Seder) as he arrives in Hollywood carrying his most valuable possessions: a suitcase and a typewriter. Edgar Allen's best attribute is his wild imagination. He imagines scenes so vividly for the murder mystery he is writing that they seem to come to life...and they do! As mysterious murders pile up, and Edgar Allen must confront old actresses, rock stars, and the police in the bleak setting of broken dreams in Hollywood.
