Three space women land on Earth in search of sexual energy to fuel their spaceship and get back home. They befriend a lonely farmboy who helps them on their plight, all while evading their mortal enemies, the Scrotes.
From the depths of the infinite space, the sexy female humanoids--Carrieola, Vanassa, and Ragyna--find themselves stranded on the little blue planet called Earth. With their hideous arch-enemies, the Scrotes, hot on their trail, and their spacecraft low on sexual energy, the curious girls will have to trust the kind farm boy, Charlie, who knows how to help them. Now, the unlimited force stemming from the sexually charged local strip club is the only way to refuel the spaceship; however, what happens if the innocent earthling falls for one of the intergalactic visitors? Will the babes from outer space ever return home?
