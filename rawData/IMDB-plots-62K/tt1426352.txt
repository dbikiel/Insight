As a young girl Ana was a rebellious child. She was also tormented by images of death and a shadowy, ominous figure in black. Now an adult, she is once again tormented by shadowy, other-worldly forms.
Three key moments, all of them sensual, define Ana's life. Her carnal search sways between reality and colored fantasies becoming more and more oppressive. A black laced hand prevents her from screaming. The wind lifts her dress and caresses her thighs. A razor blade brushes her skin, where will this chaotic and carnivorous journey leave her?
Unfolding three important chapters in her life and spanning nearly thirty years of personal fears and fervent desires, this is young Ana's journey from a haunted childhood, to a wild adolescence, and then, to an adulthood engulfed by fantasy. This is an acid trip into the morbid fascination of death; the overwhelming force of a profound sexual awakening; the compellingly appealing frustrations of a grown-up woman; a dilapidated seaside villa--inextricable elements bound together with black lace and malevolent apparitions of a tormented past, labyrinthine nightmares, and finally, a sharp-edged straight razor.
