After the death of a much despised patriarch, a mysterious box shows up during the reading of the will, forcing the family to reckon with each of their own deadly sins.
When five relatives come to the perfectly ordered home of David Harris, a shut in, to hear the reading of the will of his hated father, they are surprised by the delivery of an old antique box. Once activated, the box starts to reveal special items to each one in turn, which lead to surprising and mysterious deaths. As each person succumbs to the box's mysterious hold on them, David fears his father's dangerous spirit has returned from the dead demanding retribution. But he soon realizes something far more ancient and terrifying has invaded his protected home, and if he can't solve the puzzle of the devilish box, he will surely die with the rest of them, all entombed in his house forever.
