A college prank at an abandoned house accidentally awakens a frightening spirit.
(EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW THAT THIS IS A SPOILER. DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID AND READ IT IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO WATCH THE MOVIE!!!) College students and cousins, Rene and Zane, take a weekend trip to their family's old ranch house in the desert. They bring with them Zane's friend/tutor Phil, Rene's boyfriend Danny, and two pledges from Rene's sorority (Laura and Julie) who are in the midst of their initiation. It turns into a weekend from Hell. Lester the caretaker had been trying to find the family's buried gold and had partly dug up a grave. The cousins' ancestor had murdered his first wife, and it was her grave that had been disturbed. Her ghost proceeds to murder everyone in the house until she is finally stopped by Laura and her penchant for having tattoos of protection symbols from various religions/cultures on various parts of her body (one of which is an exact match for the pendant the dead wife had in life that was taken by her killer and eventually given to Rene by Zane.)
