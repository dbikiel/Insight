Confine, a taut psychological thriller, stars Daisy Lowe in her first lead role as the troubled former model Pippa, who hasn't dared leave her London apartment in four years. Pippa's refuge is violently invaded when an armed thief, Kayleigh (Eliza Bennett), breaks in and takes Pippa hostage. Alfie Allen (Game of Thrones), plays Kayleigh's increasingly hapless partner-in-crime who soon realises he is way out of his depth.
