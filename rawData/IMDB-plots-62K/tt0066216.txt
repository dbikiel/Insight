Suzy arrives in London with nowhere to stay and meets Fiona, a groupie who has settled into a relationship with Lee, bassist and singer with the band Forever More. At first Suzy is just one of many girls who follow the groups and make themselves sexually available to musicians and their hangers-on. When the band goes on tour she is left behind. For some time she lives on the streets with Pogo, a gentle hippie drifter who is eventually killed in a road accident. After the accident she meets Fiona again. She becomes accepted as part of Forever More's entourage and develops the glamorous style and hard attitude of an experienced groupie.
