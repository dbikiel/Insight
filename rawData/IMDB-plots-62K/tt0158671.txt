A lawyer has to defend his lover who's blamed for a murder he has commited himself...
Lawyer Andrew Garfield has a love affair with Jane, a deaf woman. A day when Jane's husband comes home early and catches them, Andrew shoots him. The police think Jane killed her husband and wants Andrew to defend her in court. Now he has to defend her, without drawing suspicion upon himself, and at the same time, this may be the big case he needs to improve his career.
When Canadian attorney Andrew Garfield meets at an exhibition, deaf painter Jane Claire, who seems to be abused by her millionaire husband Noby Claire, his amateur knowledge of sign-language (for a former girlfriend) breaks the ice to what soon becomes a carnal affair. One evening, Noby catches them pants-down and attacks Andrew with a crow bar, so he shoots the husband with a gun he knew she hid there, and tries to dispose of the body. The police suspects Jane but Andrew manages to defend her brilliantly without coming forward as involuntary killer, earning him a fat check and enough publicity to be offered a partnership. However the murder on Frank Rutter, a former client who helped Andrew investigate, convinces him of a set-up suspecting to be used to get Jane the entire fortune, unlike the pittance in case of divorce provided by a prenuptial. There is another conspirator.
