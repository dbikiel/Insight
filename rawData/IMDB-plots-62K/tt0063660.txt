A narrated pseudo-documentary about sexuality in Sweden. It shows contraceptives for teen girls, lesbian nightclubs, wife swapping, porno movies, biker gangs, and Walpurgis Night celebrations. It also examines Sweden's purported drug, drinking and suicide problems. It features the original appearance of the Piero Umiliani's nonsense song "Mah Nà Mah Nà" which was later popularized by "Sesame Street" and "The Muppet Show".
The film is made up essentially of nine sketches with a voice off narrator linking the scenes. Those sketches were described thus in the English poster devised for theatrical distribution in the UK and the USA: «The Love Cruise: A training trip for turned-on teens. The Bachelorette Party: A bride-to-be's last fling. The Public Library of Private Thrills: Government erotica. Moonlighting Nudes: Meter-maids by day - models at night. The Swap Shop: A trade-in deal for married couples only. The Polar Bare Club: The world's most beautiful snow-girls. Stockolm Strip: A haven for hippies, where everything is free. Communal for Survival: The radiation-proof city beneath a city. Stockolm's Students: A love generation that practices what it preaches.»
