When a traveling carnival comes to a small town, a lifelong slacker meets the girl of his dreams (Rachael Taylor) and wakes up to the life he has yet to begin living.
Splinterheads tells the story of Justin Frost, a slacker whose life is turned upside down when a traveling carnival rolls in to town for the summer, bringing with it an outrageous crew of carnival workers, who call themselves 'splinterheads' and earn a living by hustling an endless stream of townies out of their hard-earned cash. When Justin begins to fall for one of them, a striking, street-smart con-artist named Galaxy, he finds that there are a few people in his life complicating his pursuit of his dream girl: a love-sick police sergeant who happens to be his mom's ex-boyfriend, his 116-year-old grandfather who is the newly minted "World's Oldest Living Man," his best friend and current employer Wayne Chung, and Galaxy's insanely jealous, belligerent carnie boyfriend Reggie.
