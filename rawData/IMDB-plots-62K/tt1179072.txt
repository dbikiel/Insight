A burning love story of legless soldier and creative girl.
A beautiful and touching story based on Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale "The Steadfast Tin Soldier". A tin soldier without a leg sees a beautiful paper ballerina and falls in love. While trying to reach her, he falls from the window and has to overcome countless obstacles to see her again.
The animated film begins and ends at the table of the writer who composes a fairy tale and reads it to the audience. The one-legged tin soldier remains at night on guard at his box and watches the beautiful ballerina. They fall in love with each other, but the troll from the box tries to intimidate the ballerina. The soldier bravely stands up for her, and the opponent decides to take revenge on him, luring him to the window and dropping him down.
