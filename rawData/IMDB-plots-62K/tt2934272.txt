Ryder and Julina have just fallen madly in love. But this passionate romance is forbidden--it goes against the laws of their polygamous community. Things only get more complicated when Ryder's father declares that God has chosen Julina to be his wife.
This is a really good film and covers a range of uncomfortable subjects relating to polygamy. In a Mormon-style compound in Utah, 'prophet' Ervil, the leader of the group, drives around in a nice car and leers at the women. He is younger than most who run this type of community. The main characters are Julina, the 17 year old heroine, and Ryder, the son of the evil Ervil (yes that's his name.) Julina comes to the religious compound with her widowed mother who is looking for spirituality after her husband's death. As Julina and Ryder fall for each other and their love develops, Ervil calls Julina in and says that God has told him to marry her. She is horrified and doesn't want to have anything to do with him. Then a young girl, who had befriended Julina, collapses on her as she tries to talk to her. It transpires that she is pregnant and too young to have a baby. Julina's mum is a trained nurse and as she is seeing to the girl, she tells Ervil that she needs to ring for an ambulance. He refuses and the young girl dies. Then he drops his son in the middle of nowhere, declaring that Ryder is the devil. Ryder makes his way to the city and manages to find one of his friends, Mike, who had been banished and asks him for help. He refuses at first and an ex-priest takes him under his wing, making Mike decide to help him. They set out to rescue Julina before she marries Ervil.The performance by William Mapother is particularly chilling and the movie takes some twists and turns you won't see coming.
