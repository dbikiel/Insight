Dr. Leonard Gillespie, for several reasons and not all medically related, asks a young surgeon, Dr. Tommy Coalt, to go to a small town and replace a local doctor while he is on vacation. There, Coalt is asked to sign commitment papers on a young lady, Cythia Grace, for reasons of insanity. Coalt thinks there is something amiss in Our Town and King's Row, and begins his own investigation.
