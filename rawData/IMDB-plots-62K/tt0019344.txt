A prostitute seeking a fresh start becomes the obsession of a religious extremist.
Sadie Thompson arrives in Pago-Pago to start a new life, but when extremist missionary Davidson lashes out against her lifestyle and tries to force her back to San Francisco, she may lose her second chance.
A steamship originating from San Francisco has just docked on the South Pacific island of Tutuila at the port of Pago Pago, where some US Marines are stationed. Among the passengers is Sadie Thompson, for who Pago Pago is only a transit stop in that she is on her way to Apia on the nearby island of Upolu, where she is to start work for the steamship company itself. Due to circumstances, she is forced to stay in Pago Pago additional days, which places her in a difficult situation as she slowly starts to run out of money. Sadie is either fun loving or a harlot depending on one's perspective, the latter perspective that of Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Davidson, fellow passengers on that steamship. Davidson, a self-professed deacon, is a reformer who has the ear of all the governors representing the South Pacific islands. His self-righteous and sanctimonious beliefs and attitudes include sinners needing to show true penance to achieve ultimate salvation. He believes that Sadie is a prostitute who is going to continue to ply her trade in Apia. He is only half right as she was a prostitute in San Francisco, where she left to start life anew. Davidson confronts her with his beliefs about her, he threatening to get the governor to deport her back to San Francisco, which would be her worst nightmare as she is also escaping other things in San Francisco. By this time, Sadie and US Marine Sergeant Tim O'Hara have fallen in love with each other, Tim who knows her past but still wants to marry her to live a new life together in Sydney. As such, Tim does whatever he can to stop the powerful Davidson, who is not as righteous as he would like the world to believe.
