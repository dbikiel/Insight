With Jerry Lewis (1926-2017) as executive producer, this is in essence an autobiography. It follows his career chronologically from the 10-year partnership with Dean Martin to Lewis's career as writer, producer, director, and actor in a series of Paramount pictures. The chronology is told through archival clips, comments by family members and Hollywood friends, comments from Lewis himself, and clips of him in a contemporary nightclub appearance. Lewis vows to live longer than George Burns.
