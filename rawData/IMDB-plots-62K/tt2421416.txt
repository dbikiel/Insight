In an attempt to sign a Hollywood starlet, struggling talent agent and former child star Howard Holloway must contend with her volatile father, a scheming long-time rival, and a producer and casting director who despise him.
A struggling agent for child actors and former child star himself, Howard Holloway spends years losing his most talented clients to his slick, arch-nemesis Aldo Shocklee. Until the day that Howard encounters the brilliant and unsigned 13 year-old Lydia who is on the brink of securing the lead in a new Twilight-style franchise. Howard tries desperately to close the deal of a lifetime and make his precocious young client a star while managing her drunk, volatile father, Aldo's relentless poaching attempts, and the hostile machinations of the project's casting director and mega producer, who both despise him. But the closer he gets to achieving the Hollywood score he has chased all his life, the more complications appear.
