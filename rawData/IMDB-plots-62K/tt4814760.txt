A young woman struggles to survive on her own in the wake of a mysterious epidemic that has killed much of society, and forced her deep into the unforgiving wilderness.
In the deep, rude and fearful wilderness, Ann, a solitary woman, is foraging for food relying on her limited survival skills. At the same time, in the wake of an apocalyptic global catastrophe, an appalling and virulent epidemic has already decimated most of the population, severely infecting its remaining carriers with symptoms including delirium and unpredictable behaviour coupled with aggressive outbursts. Inevitably, now that Ann's husband and baby daughter have ultimately succumbed to the invisible and inescapable plague, her days are filled with memories of a not-so-distant life defined by order and security, forcing occasionally the wary woman to hazard raids to nearby farmhouses for supplies. During one of those desperate runs, Ann will discover teenage Olivia and her wounded stepfather Chris who intend to head north, nevertheless, the quiet but ominous stillness is always blemished by the certitude that danger is everywhere, in the shape of ravenous, half-human flesh-eating predators. Under those circumstances, who shall live and who shall die?
