A car pilot must choose between his love for car-racing, and his wife. His buddy's accident will help him to choose, and his loyal ways will get him a new friend - his main rival.
Peter Wells, a former world class driver of midget racers, has been struggling to regain his winning form in the two years since his discharge as an Air Force pilot. He's being pressed by his wife, who worries about his safety, to quit and his best friend 'Pic' Dallapiccola to retire to the pit crew. Wells also feels pressure from Guido Rosetti, a rival younger driver on his Corsi team, who thinks he's lost his nerve. After he has a disagreement with Pic just prior to an important race, his friend's car is involved in a horrific accident. Against orders, Wells quits the race early to be able to make his peace with his friend, who lies dying in the hospital. Tony Bellario, his Corsi boss, initially fires him for his actions, but relents and gives him one last desperate chance to redeem himself in the upcoming Grand Prix.
