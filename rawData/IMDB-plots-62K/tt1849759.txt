In the tradition of O' Brother Where Art Thou and the Irish Waking Ned, and set in a wonderfully photographic, Southamerican environment comes this comedy. Hilarious characters pulling together to make a dream come true, our hero's index finger is the excuse that drives the villagers to discover a murder, turn around the election to the town's mayor, renew their Christian's faith, build new love relationships. In other words wake up the quiet Latin American town of Cerro Colorado. Who knows where these people will get with the help of the magic finger?.
