An intense psychological drama around four people in a remote country village; where a creature is killing the local animals.
An intense psychological drama around four people in a remote country village. Maurice and Ida are on old married couple who have said all they have to say to each other decades ago. One neighbour is Murray Jacob, a lonely, intense man with a tragic past; the other is a late arrival, a young woman, Ronnie, who is six months pregnant and recently abandoned by her boyfriend. Something is killing the local animals, and Ronnie's pregnancy stirs up memories of the Stubbs' son's cot death. Fears and shadows play on their minds, making the four uneasy associates as animals are found disemboweled around their homes.
Living on a farm in the Australian Outback, middle-aged Maurice Stubbs and his wife Ida think that they hear noises in the nearby woods at night. In the morning they find a slaughtered animal. At the same time neighbor Murray Jacob, a man from the city who has come to live in seclusion nearby, finds his neighbor, the young pregnant Ronnie whose boyfriend has just left her, lying unconscious in the field and brings her back to his place. She runs out when she finds Murray has undressed her but returns to ask his help when she finds that all her ducks have been mysteriously slaughtered. The four of them come together in an effort to find out what is killing the livestock. Ronnie tells about a group of cultists in the area who ritually slaughter cats, while Maurice thinks that foxes or wild cats may be responsible. As he and Murray go hunting for the source of the killings, Maurice with increasing obsessiveness, buried secrets that each of the four hold begin to uncomfortably emerge.
