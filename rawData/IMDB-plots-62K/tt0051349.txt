In 1867, a Yankee patrol joins forces with a group of ex-Confederate soldiers in order to cross Apache territory and reach the nearest fort.
The survivors of an Army patrol ambushed by Indians hook up with a group of cowboys who have also been attacked, and together they try to get to safety at the fort. Unfortunately for them, they're carrying a shipment of several dozen rifles that the Indians want, and are determined to get.
