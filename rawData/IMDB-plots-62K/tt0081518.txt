The Institute for Advanced Concepts, headed by Dr. Carl Becker along with four fellow scientists, has unlimited resources secretly funded by the highest powers to conduct unfettered research to control and manipulate the world in all aspects. Their next brainchild of a project is to brainwash someone in believing that he is an alien and unleash him into the world to see what happens. That brainwashing includes making him believe that his "mother" produced him in the form of a human, much like one would produce a toaster. Who they choose is Psychology professor Dr. Simon Mendelssohn, partly because he was a foundling whose true origins no one can question. They are able to lure him to the Institute under the guise of being able to conduct his own research, his fascination with but little understanding of sensory deprivation which they are further able to capitalize on in the brainwashing process. To further ensure that Simon complies, they plan on using their seductive female "associate", Dr. Cynthia Mallory, to act as a Juliet operative. Unleashing Simon the alien into the world, they will have to contend with his casual girlfriend, Lisa, a Music professor at the same New York City college, she who may have her own ways of proving that Simon is not the alien he and they assert he is.
