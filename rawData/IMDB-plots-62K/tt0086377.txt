Four young soldiers waiting to be shipped to Viet Nam deal with racial tension and their own intolerance when one soldier reveals he's gay.
Four young recruits about to be sent to Vietnam confront their prejudicial feelings toward one another when it's learned one of them is homosexual.
Based on the Broadway play of the same name by 'David Rabe', and adapted by Rabe for the screen, Streamers examines the interactions, prejudices, trepidations, and personal conflicts of a small group of U.S. Army recruits preparing to deploy for combat in the Vietnam conflict. Featured are middle class African American Roger, upper class Manhattanite Richie (who is conflicted about his sexual orientation), conservative Wisconsin farm boy Billy, and scared black street punk Carlyle. Caustic alcoholic Sgt. Cokes, who's already served in combat, and aggressive Sgt. Rooney, who is anxious to get into combat, are in charge of the barracks.
