In separate stories, five wedded couples learn that they are not legally married.
A Justice of the Peace performed weddings a few days before his license was valid. A few years later five couples learn they have never been legally married. Annabel Norris, already Mrs. Mississippi and ready to enter the Mrs. America contest, is now free to enter the Miss Mississippi contest.
A bumbling justice-of-the-peace performs several illegal marriages. Thirty months later, he discovers his mistake and five couples must deal with the news that they're not married. Included: Ramona and Steve, who loathe each other but married to get a lucrative radio contract; the winner of the Mrs. Mississippi pageant; a couple who barely speak, while the husband dreams of former flames; an oil tycoon and a gold-digger after his wealth; and soldier Willie Fisher, about to ship out to the Korean War leaving his gorgeous spouse pregnant.
