Dr. Worley investigates a 300-year-old witch's curse in the New England town of Devonsville. Three liberated, assertive women move into town, which angers the bigoted, male-dominated town fathers. One of the women is a reincarnation of the witch, who proceeds to exact revenge on the town males.
As a consequence of its barbaric persecution of three 'witches,' long ago, a rural township is afflicted with a vengeful curse. Acutely aware of its existence, a local physician attempts to study its history through the hypnotic past-life regression of town descendants. Once again, three women, new-arrivals from out-of-town, seem to be threatening the status quo. Are the women doomed to suffer from this town's terrible legacy?
A witch hunt in Devonsville 300 years ago purges three young ladies, one of which screams a curse as she disappears into the nether world. Now it's The Present, and things come to a head when a man kills his wife, thus activating the curse. A new school teacher comes to town, and finds the town suspicious of her, as she tries to find out what the town is hiding.
