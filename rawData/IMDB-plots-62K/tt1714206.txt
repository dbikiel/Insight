A hard-partying high school senior's philosophy on life changes when he meets the not-so-typical "nice girl."
Sutter Keely lives in the now. It's a good place for him. A high school senior, charming and self-possessed, he's the life of the party, loves his job at a men's clothing store, and has no plans for the future. A budding alcoholic, he's never far from his supersized, whiskey-fortified thirst-master cup. But after being dumped by his girlfriend, Sutter gets drunk and wakes up on a lawn with Aimee Finecky hovering over him. She's different: the "nice girl" who reads science fiction and doesn't have a boyfriend. While Aimee has dreams of a future, Sutter lives in the impressive delusion of a spectacular now, yet somehow, they're drawn together.
Charismatic, well-meaning, and the life of the party, the kind-hearted high school senior, Sutter Keely, makes great efforts to hide himself behind a carefree but ephemeral present, and a jumbo fast-food, booze-spiked soda cup. However, after a night of hard-partying and an unpleasant break-up, Sutter will wake up in a random front yard, where Aimee Finicky, his bookish and unpopular classmate, finds him during her regular newspaper-delivering route. Polar opposites, still, attracted to each other, can there be a spectacular future for Sutter and Aimee?

Awakening in the grass under the gaze of studious, practical-minded nerd Aimee Finicky, he isn't quite sure how he got into such a predicament.
