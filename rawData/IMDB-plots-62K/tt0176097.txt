A crazed rock singer returns from the dead to murder members of his former band.
This horror movie begins with rock star Billy Eye (Tray Loren) losing his sanity and killing his colleagues at a recording studio. Billy is tried, found guilty and executed. The woman who testified against him at his murder trial is a successful singer with a group called Rocktober Blood. Two years have gone by, and just when she thinks the horror of the murder case is dead and buried, someone that looks a lot like Billy starts to terrorize her.
