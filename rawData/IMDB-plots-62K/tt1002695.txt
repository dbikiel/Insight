"TED: The future we will create" gives you an all-access pass inside the world of TED to what Wired Magazine refers to as "arguably the hottest gathering around." Every year for four days, an eclectic group of the world's most brilliant minds converge to share big new ideas that will shape our future. For the first time you are invited behind the scenes with actor Daphne Zuniga as she takes you on this amazing journey of discovery, laughter and inspiration that is TED. Take a seat next to the founders of Google or the creator of The Simpsons, and enjoy the same enlightening experience that they paid $4,400 for!
