The countrymen in the hills of Missouri take the hounds on night fox hunts. This goes on until Jacob Terry comes into the county and decides to raise sheep and install a woven wire fence. This upsets the neighbors since the dogs would not harm the sheep and they will be hurt running into the fence at night. Jacobs vows to shoot any dogs or people that he finds on his land. But Bengy Davis is in love with Camden Terry and that alone causes problems. But when the hound, Bugle Ann is missing one night, both sides are out with guns to settle the score.
