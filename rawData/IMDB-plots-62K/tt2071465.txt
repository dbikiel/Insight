1979. Carole and Jerome are 20 and go on tour in Odessa, behind the Iron Curtain. They are cousins and pretend engaged. The day as tourists, they visit monuments and museums. In the evening, they part company and the group meet clandestinely refuseniks, Jews harassed by the Soviet regime for trying to leave the country. They discover an unknown world, brutal and absurd. If Carole is driven by the commitment and willingness to take risks, to Jerome, the real motivation of this trip is Carole.
