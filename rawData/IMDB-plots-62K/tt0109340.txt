On the verge of forced resignation, a strict old-fashioned teacher rethinks his life.
Andrew Crocker-Harris (Albert Finney) is an embittered and disliked teacher of Greek and Latin at a British public school. After nearly twenty years of service, he is being forced to retire on the pretext of his health, and perhaps may not even be given a pension. The boys regard him as a Hitler, with some justification. His wife Laura (Greta Scacchi) is unfaithful, and lives to wound him any way she can. Andrew must come to terms with his failed life and regain at least his own self-respect.
A student (Taplow, played by Ben Silverstone) completely changes the self-perception of his master (Andrew Crocker-Harris, played by Albert Finney) so that the master can accept his forced retirement from his academic establishment with his head held high.
