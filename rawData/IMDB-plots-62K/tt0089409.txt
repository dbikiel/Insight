The CIA, KGB and RCMP are after an honest lady banker and her crusading journalist friend after the two come into the possession of a superchip that could start WWIII, if it walls into the wrong hands.
The CIA, KGB and RCMP are after a lady banker (Kidder) who has a piece of mutated microchip that engages directly with brain cells. Unfortunately, the only one who believes her is a sardonic TV news anchor with a crusading streak (Michael Sarrazin) whom she met on a train. They team up in order to survive and get to the bottom of things.
