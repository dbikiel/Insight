Tarzan's jungle home, and his family, Jane and Boy, are threatened by men greedy for gold.
A scientific expedition happens to discover that gold exits on Tarzan's escarpment. The villainous Medford and Vandermeer kidnap Jane and Boy to extort from Tarzan the location of the gold. Everyone is captured by wicked natives. Tarzan and his elephants rush to the rescue.
After Boy is taken prisoner by local tribesmen and rescued by Prof. Elliott and his team of explorers, Tarzan offers to show them a way to their destination through the escarpment that will save them several weeks. Problems arise however when Boy mentions to two of the men that the river bed near his home is covered in gold. Greed drives them from that point on and they will apparently go to any lengths to gets their hands on the precious yellow metal.
Mountains of endless virgin gold gleam atop the colossal and steep Mutia Escarpment, and fragments of the rare precious metal dazzle the wide-eyed Boy who, naturally, wants to get a taste of the incredible wonders of civilisation. However, when Boy sneaks off to see the world, a chance encounter with Professor Elliott and his unscrupulous companions, Medford and Vandermeer, will spread a wild gold fever, as those ruthless white prospectors are after the land's untouched deposits. Will Tarzan yield to the evil adventurers' ultimatum?
