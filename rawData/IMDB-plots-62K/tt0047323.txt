Railroad investigator tries to find the reason behind constant Indian attacks on the railroad.
It's just after the Civil War and a railroad is expanding westward. Saloon owner Stewart brings in rifles hidden in whisky barrels and gives them to the Indians to attack the construction crew. He is trying to get the railroad to change it's route and go through his town. Posing as a telegrapher, railroad agent Granger arrives to see if he can stop the railroad's troubles.
The Overland Pacific RR is laying track through the Comanche hunting grounds with the Indians constantly attacking the workmen. The company sends ace trouble-shooter Ross Granger, posing as a telegrapher,to the nearby town of Oaktown to investigate. He meets saloon owner Del Stewart, Sheriff Blaney and Ann Dennison, daughter of the railroad construction foreman Dennison. Dennison is killed when he refuses a bribe from the leader of the faction that is keeping the Indians stirred up against the railroad so that the line will be changed to run through Oaktown. Mahoney, in his days of doubling for Charles Starret in the Durango Kid series, and Sears, as a director of some of them, had seen and been involved with this plot a couple of times before at Columbia but this one has the added advantage of color, Peggie Castle and Adele Jergens.
