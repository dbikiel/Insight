In this romantic comedy, faded movie actress Laurine Lynne decides to take a trip to Europe rather than continue to be depressed by her lack of career momentum in Hollywood. She leaves a boyfriend, polo champion Ricky Preston and her loyal agent, Joe Craig in Hollywood, and travels to an unspecified region of Europe for a stay at a posh hotel. Accompanying her is her smart-aleck maid Trommy. While staying at the hotel, she is annoyed by a cheeky waiter, who, it is revealed, is actually Prince Rupert Heinrich Franz von Rentzau working incognito. Laurine is further annoyed to learn that back in Hollywood, her rival, Sandra Drew, has gotten the part she wanted due to the publicity surrounding her marriage to nobility. Laurine arranges to marry a nobleman solely because of his title, who turns out to be Prince Rupert. They honeymoon briefly and happily, but complications arise, and Laurine heads back to Hollywood and a replenished career. While working at Associated Studios, Laurine finds that Prince Rupert has come to join her in Tinseltown, and his excessive spending drives her to distraction. Joe, however, finds out that Prince Rupert is a good man after all, and Laurine really falls in love with him, deciding to abandon her screen career to be his wife.
A pass√©-and-fading movie actress, at the suggestion of her press agent, goes to Europe and buys a title, but in the form of a husband. Her Prince refuses to accompany her back to Hollywood. The publicity gets her a renewed contract at the studio, buy while she is giving an interview for the press (and announcing she has just received a cable for her husband in Europe) he bounds in. He begins to spend her money lavishly, buying a Rolls-Royce and lots of jewelry. She is angered but all is forgiven when she learns he has deposited an amount equal to what he has spent in a bank account in her name.
