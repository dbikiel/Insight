Three young men decide to plan a mock kidnapping, but everything goes wrong because a real bank robbery was already planned by two other guys.
Three young men live in the 50s somewhere in America. They've grown up and and now they plan to do a mock robbery of a bank. But in an other place, Florence plans a real bank robbery. The destination is the same...
Surrealistic tale of three teen boys practical joke gone astray as it becomes interwoven into a ex-con and his friend's real crime. There is an undercurrent of repressed gay attraction between and from the ex-cons. Throughout the movie there are several small character parts that are slightly out of kilter giving it additional surrealistic leanings.
