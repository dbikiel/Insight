Two friends keep their vomiting a secret until one friend almost dies.
When two friends, Lexi and Jennifer try and get in shape, they start to get rid of their food by vomiting it up. Lexi is then taken to a bulemic center by her worried mom. When she recovers she tells her mom that Jennifer might still have the same problem. Lexi's mom confronts Jennifer's mom and Jennifer get mad at Lexi. Lexi tries to reason to Jennifer at a beach party while Jennifer is drunk and Jennifer refuses and runs away from her. She is then hit by a passing car and Lexi becomes depressed and the vomiting starts again.
When her parents divorce, shallow Alexis 'Lexi' Archer moves with ma Catherine and kid sister Jill to Seattle. Trough her only talent, volleyball, she finds a single friend on high school, popular, pretty and together brat Jennifer 'Jen', who teaches her tricks to be attractive, but also how to become absurdly thin trough excessive dieting, which soon escalates into anorexia: even dear dad Peter Archer in Chicago can't get her to enjoy anything with calories; as if that weren't unhealthy enough, she gets bulimia, pig-out sessions followed by self-induced vomiting, till it causes blood to come too while all muscles, even the heart, are effectively starved. Ma is sensible enough to find out and send her to a clinic, but too weak to have her forced-fed in time, so dad steps in. When she's finally released home, she tells ma about Jen's similar skinniness-obsession, with even more tragic consequences...
