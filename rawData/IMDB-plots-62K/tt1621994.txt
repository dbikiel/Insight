In a teardrop-shaped land called Sangarashtra, a 9-year-old girl with special healing powers tries to save her homeland from the tyranny of an evil queen with the help of a blind swordsman.
The evil witch queen Irendri's reign of terror spreads across the teardrop-shaped land Sangarashtra. The strong are forced to join her army, the weak are sacrificed to her snake demon. Moksha, a young girl raised in a monastery untouched by the tyranny, has been gifted with healing powers. Irendri knows that the child's blood will grant her immortality, and sends her army to find her. Moksha's sworn protector is Yodha --a blind swordsman who dreams of his lost love, the beautiful gypsy girl Priya. Can they find a way to conquer Irendri and her dark forces?
