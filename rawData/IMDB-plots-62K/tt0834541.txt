An odd couple take to the open road. Having followed his girlfriend out to California's Wine Country for the summer, Yale law student Sherman finds himself dumped, and cut off from his high-society mother's money. A stranger stranded in a strange land, he hitches a ride with Palmer, a washed-up, unapologetically eccentric Olympic athlete. There are detours along the way, including the possibility of an enlightening girlfriend, an encounter with a gun-wielding gourmet chef and a chance for the former athlete to be on top again. A comedy about absent fathers and damaged sons striving to find balance between responsibility and recklessness.
An eccentric Olympic has-been who prefers leisure to work, finds himself stuck with a rigid pre-law Yale student with no time for wasting time. Between skinny-dipping and stealing cars, this odd-couple learn from each other that balance is the key to getting the girl, getting the job and getting a life.
The life of Yale law student Sherman (Michael Shulman, ''Party of Five'') takes an unexpected turn when he decides to follow his girlfriends (Lacey Chabert, ''Not Another Teen Movie'') advice and take more chances in life. She meant their relationship. But Shermans new spontaneity lands him in the car seat next to Palmer (James LeGros, ''Sleeper Cell'', ''Ally McBeal''), a washed-up, cheerfully eccentric former Olympic athlete.
Dumped and cut off from his mothers funds, Sherman has to travel to Southern California for an important job opportunity. But with oddball Palmer at the wheel, will he reach his destination before his sanity runs out? The road holds many funny and revealing curves along the way, including a possibility of new love, a gun-toting former gourmet chef (Enrico Colantoni, ''Veronica Mars'') and a chance for the former sportsman to prove himself again. For anybody who ever dreamed of following his/her impulses, ''Shermans Way'' provides the ultimate clash between snob and slob. [D-Man2010]
