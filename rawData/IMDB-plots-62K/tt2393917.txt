A documentary exploring the importance of revival cinema and 35mm exhibition - seen through the lens of the patrons of the New Beverly Cinema - a unique and independent revival cinema in Los Angeles.
The New Bev is a theater where a double feature is still $8 - cash only. A theater where David Lynch pops by for a secret Q&amp;A and where Edgar Wright introduces our monthly midnight screening of Scott Pilgrim whenever he is in town. A theater where directors program a week of their favorite films and come down to talk about how they inspired them. A theater where Fassbinder, Romero, Scorsese and Hitchcock films all show in the same week. Where you could catch a double feature of Citizen Kane and The Magnificent Ambersons - then stick around for the midnight screening of Cool As Ice. A place where the owner and employees genuinely care about cinema and are excited to talk to you about what the ending of Primer really means, or to recommend a film you've maybe never heard of. Since 1978 we've been home to dedicated film geeks, casual moviegoers and some of the greatest directors and actors in the world - everyone is treated equally here. We're one of the last places where that happens. We are essentially running the same way we were when we opened over thirty years ago - double features for a low price with a friendly and knowledgeable staff, independently owned and solely 35mm. But revival theaters are an endangered species. In a time when the multiplex is king, and digital is taking over, this film will accentuate a nearly bygone era of cinema - where moviegoers came not only to watch a film, but also to meet up with other cinephiles and connect. This documentary will highlight the importance of this cultural gem and why the experience of watching a classic film for the first time, on 35mm, with an audience can never be replicated at home.
