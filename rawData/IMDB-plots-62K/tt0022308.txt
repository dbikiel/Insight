A Russian aristocrat and his servant girl escape to Turkey during the revolution.
February, 1917. Returning to the German front after a sybaritic leave in Moscow, Russian officer Nikita Krasnoff and his brigade are met by the first troop revolts. In the growing anarchy of the Revolution, Nikita finds himself isolated, and must make his risky way to Turkey in the unexpected company of his adoring (but virtuous) former servant Tanyusha. In Istanbul, Nikita and Tanyusha reach an understanding... but their happiness is threatened by the reappearance of Nikita's former mistress Vera, offering a false semblance of the old life.
