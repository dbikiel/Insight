After a battle with the Supervirus Daemon ends, a second Bob appears and no one is sure which Bob is the copy.
Will the real Bob please step forward? There might not be a virus, but life's still interesting in Mainframe when a second Bob comes on the scene. No one knows which is which - including the two Bobs. With wedding preparations underway, Dot can't decide who to marry and turns to her friends for assistance. Meanwhile, an old enemy returns to the system and only one of the Sprites can save the Mainframe inhabitants.
Guardian 452, Bob, finds he is not as original as he believes when another Bob is released at the end of war against the Supervirus Daemon. This Bob resembles the younger, more carefree version (seasons 1 &amp; 2 of the TV series), before his encounters with the web and merging with his keytool. So, who is the original Bob and who is the copy? Not even Dot can tell and she plans to marry one of them. Will she and the citizens of Mainframe chose the Bob of the past over the Bob of the present? More importantly, should they be looking to the past for signs of a returning threat?
