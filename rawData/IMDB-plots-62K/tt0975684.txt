Two kids, Dylan and Kylie, run away from home at Christmas and spend a night of magic and terror on the streets of inner-city Dublin.
On the fringes of Dublin, Kylie and Dylan, two pre-teen kids, live next door to each other. One night they run away, and together they make their way to the magical night time lights of inner city Dublin, to search for Dylans brother, who ran away two years previously, in the hope of finding, through him, the possibility of a new life. Dublin, as seen through the innocent eyes of our protagonists, is a kaleidoscope of magic, wonder and mystery. But as the night wears on, and Dublin takes on a darker character, the two kids have to rely on the kindness of strangers, the advice of Bob Dylan and their trust in each other to survive the night.
