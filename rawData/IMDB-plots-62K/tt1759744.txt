The tragic tale of an all-American girl who was transformed into a cold-blooded killer in the summer of 1969.
Three young women were sentenced to death in the infamous Manson murder case, but when the death penalty was lifted, their sentence became life imprisonment. One young graduate student was sent in to teach them - and through her we witness their transformations as they face the reality of their horrific crimes.
August 9, 1969 is a day that will live in infamy. Hollywood's most beautiful actress Sharon Tate, wife of director Roman Polanski, is murdered at 10050 Cielo Drive along with her friend Jay Sebring and two other guests. The culprits behind this morbid crime were a notorious cult known as The Manson Family who were led by Charles "Charlie" Manson, a failed musician who founded the family consisting of underage teenagers. But what motivated him to enact Sharon Tate's murder? The answer lies through the point-of-view from three young followers who grew attracted to Charlie and slowly begin to descend into his world of madness.
