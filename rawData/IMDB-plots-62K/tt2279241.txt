The film is called Rockabilly Zombie Weekend and it takes place in Central Florida in a modern day setting. A young couple plans to have a rockabilly themed wedding out at the old farm, despite warnings of a West Nile Virus outbreak. Things go horribly wrong when the virus spawns zombie-creating mosquitoes, who are feeding on the wedding guests as well as the other locals of course!
