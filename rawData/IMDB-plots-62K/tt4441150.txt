A scientist blames the head of a large company for an ecological disaster in South America. But when a volcano begins to show signs of erupting, they must unite to avoid a disaster.
Salt and Fire is about a mysterious hostage-taking where the leader of a small scientific delegation is deliberately stranded with two blind boys in an area of gigantic salt flats. Shot in Bolivia, the film stars Michael Shannon, Veronica Ferres and Gael Garc√≠a Bernal and was written and directed by Werner Herzog.
Three scientists sent from the UN to South America to analyze an ecological disaster are kidnapped by mercenaries, who turn out to be directed by the CEO of a Consortium allegedly responsible for said disaster. What begins to appear as a typical dangerous scenario for these abductees turns into an entirely different experience than expected, especially on the part of the science delegation leader, who through a series of very confusing yet personal circumstances, comes to realize and understand the true heart and intentions of this CEO and his desire to make things right.
