Three investors, wolves in sheeps clothes, cant for their life find heart or soul. // In their jets, they circle the globe, preaching love and earning gold. // Smoke and mirrors is their game, ministers, unions and kings enjoy their fame. // Gambling with open cards at the table, where theres no risk theres only one aim: the truth is a lie, cause lying is real when you get pranked, how does it feel?
