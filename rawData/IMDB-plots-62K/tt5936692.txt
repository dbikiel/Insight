The story of a well-known artistic family: legendary painter Zdzislaw Beksinski, his wife Zofia and their son Tomasz, a highly-praised music critic and translator. Their lives were far from being usual.
As renowned painter Zdzislaw Beksinski tapes everything with his beloved camcorder, a 28-year family saga unfolds through his disturbing dystopian paintings, family feuds, near-death experiences, love-hate relations and consecutive funerals. The true story of the artistic Beksinski family: Zdzislaw, his wife Zofia and their talented yet trouble-making son Tomasz.
Spanning nearly thirty years of artistic expression in the life of the renowned and prolific Polish painter, sculptor, documentarian and photographer, Zdzislaw Beksinski, the director Jan P. Matuszynski delves deep into an ostensibly common, middle-class family. Chronicling meticulously the story behind the facade, little by little, the film reveals the secrets of a dysfunctional family, from the deep emotional problems of Tomasz, the manic-depressive son, to the true head of the family, Zofia, and finally, to Zdzislaw's end.
