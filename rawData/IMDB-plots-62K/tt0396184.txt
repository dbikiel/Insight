Tony is released from prison - again. This time he has his mind set on changing his broken down life, but that is easier said than done.
Tony is released from prison and needs to get his life and self-respect back. What waits for him on the outside however is a ruthless father, an established criminal, who has nothing but contempt for him. A friend with dangerous hair-brained schemes, who expects Tony to stick his neck out for him. And a coke-snorting woman with a baby she claims is his.
