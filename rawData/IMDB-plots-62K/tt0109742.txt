Four women filmmakers examine sexuality in this anthology. Segment 1 is entitled "Let's Talk About Sex" and is the story of an aspiring actress whose day job is as a phone-sex operator. Tiring of listening to callers' fantasies, she finds a caller who is willing to listen to hers. Segment 2 is called "Taboo Palor" and tells the story of two lesbians, who, for variety, pick up a man for sex. He ends up getting more than he bargained for. Segment 3 is "Wonton Soup." Here an Australian-Chinese man tries to rekindle his affair with a Chinese woman by returning to their roots: both in the kitchen and in the bedroom.
EROTIQUE (German title: LET'S TALK ABOUT SEX) is a collection of three shorts by three filmmakers: "Let's Talk About Sex" by Lizzie Borden, "Taboo Parlor" by Monika Treut, and "Wonton Soup" by Clara Law. Three award-winning directors take an elegant and erotic journey from Los Angeles (Borden) to Hamburg (Treut) to Hong Kong (Law) with a unique female perspective. Daring to live out their fantasies, three couples search for adventure and fulfillment and creatively expand their horizons through their sexuality. In TABOO PARLOR, Treut's contribution to the film EROTIQUE, two stunning women, Claire and Julia, are in search of adventure. They scour the nightclubs of Hamburg trying to find the right lover for Julia, but things get heated when jealousies flare and Claire decides to fulfill her fantasies as well.
