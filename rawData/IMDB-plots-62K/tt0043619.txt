Tennis prodigy Florence Farley is torn between romance and her mother's ambitions.
Boy (Gordon) meets girl (Florence), sharing an interest in tennis. But Florence has a supremely ambitious mother who intends to push her ahead regardless (she barely knows her own husband exists). Florence's tennis career rapidly advances, thanks to mother's manipulation and a promotion-minded coach; building toward the inevitable conflict between the fulfilment of Mother's dreams...and daughter's.
A young professional tennis player, Florence Farley (Sally Forrest), rockets to championship heights, due to the constant pressure put on her by her greedy and ambitious mother, Millie Farley (Claire Trevor), who intends to live high off of her daughter's professional earnings. But, at the top of her game and in the depths of depression, the daughter rebels.
