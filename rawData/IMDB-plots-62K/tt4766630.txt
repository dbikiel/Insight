Young Jewish man bucks orthodox traditions (and mother's meddling) by shaving, shopping outside the faithful, and considering a shiksa for a wife.
Young orthodox Jew Mordechai Wolkenbruch, called Motti, has a serious problem: All the women, whom his mama introduces to him as potential wives, look just like her. Fellow student Laura, however, does not, at all - but unfortunately she is a schikse. She wears pants, has a nice tuches, drinks gin and tonic, and swears. Motti begins to have doubts about the predetermined path given by his parents as the road for him to follow? His obedience towards his mother's disturbing methods starts to fade as his passion for Laura grows. Things take their course, and very soon Motti comes to a conclusion: even schiksen can be totally nuts.
Motti Wolkenbruch, a young Orthodox Jew, finds himself at a turning point. His beloved mother, wanting him to get married, presents one bridal candidate after another. Unfortunately none of the woman please Motti - they all look just like Mama. The situation gets even more complicated when Motti secretly falls in love with Laura, a non-Jewish girl (a so-called Shiksa).
