Divine Crawford who gives all - in this really funny comedy , she donated all her salary from this movie to the red cross after Carol Lombard's plane crashed .
Margaret Drew runs her trucking company single-mindedly, if not ruthlessly. The only thorn in her side is writer Michael Holmes who is writing a book on some of her tough ways. With no time for men, the effect an attractive stranger has on her at her sister's wedding is unnerving. When it turns out this is the hated writer, she starts seriously to lose her bearings. Surely it can't become Maggie and Mike?
Margaret J. Drew, who rules her family with the same iron-hand that she runs the family trucking corporation, learns that author Michael Holmes is preparing a book about her late, unscrupulous father which is bound to be uncomplimentary because of his piratical career. Plus, she is faced with a damage suit filed by Holmes because she had him arrested for kissing her sister, Vivian, at the latter's wedding. Holmes tells Margaret that he will drop the lawsuit if she goes incognito with him to the Dare-employee's dance. She does and inadvertently wins a jitterbug contest. Holmes unconcern for the money he is suing for awakens Margaret to romance.
