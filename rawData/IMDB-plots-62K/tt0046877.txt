A Navy lieutenant is borrowed by the British to supervise torpedo experiments after one of their scientists is killed.
A top secret naval base is located on an island near the coast of Scotland. There, a small group of British naval officers and their staff are joined by an American scientist and his assistants to devise a new kid of torpedo. If successful, this torpedo has the potential to guarantee Anglo-American naval superiority. But testing the newly created weapon turns out to be more dangerous than expected. As tests fail, the growing crisis escalates tensions between British and Americans on the island. With the British navy becoming more skeptical that the torpedo will ever work, the project is in danger of being called off. The American staff struggles to perfect the new weapon before it's too late. Will they succeed?
