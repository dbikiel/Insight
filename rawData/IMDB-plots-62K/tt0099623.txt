As a political cartoonist (Gene Wilder) and his bride (Christine Lahti) fail to conceive, he and a sorority girl (Mary Stuart Masterson) succeed.
When Duffy Bergman, a New York City cartoonist, meets Meg Lloyd, a gourmet chef, he discovers the love of his life and they marry, yet love alone isn't enough to make them happy. Meg decides she wants to have a baby, a goal that initially makes Duffy frantic, but soon becomes his most important desire as well. When they are unable to have a baby, Meg begins concentrating on her career and the two slowly drift apart, eventually separating. Later, when Duffy is speaking at a convention of the Delta Gamma sorority, he reveals that the Delta Gamma girls have always been his dream girls, his Love Goddesses. There, he meets the young and uninhibited Delta Gamma girl, Daphne Delillo. When Daphne moves to New York City to work as a network sports reporter, their mutual attraction, and Daphne's spontaneity spark an adventurous new relationship for Duffy. Now Duffy must decide which is more valuable to him, the relationship he has given up, or the relationship he has always dreamed of having.
