A man and a woman on a motorcycle arrive with a ferry to Assens. They want to catch the next ferry in Nyborg, on the other side of the island, but this ferry will leave in three quarters of an hour and the ferry berth is 70 km away. The road has lot of curves, but they ride the bike in a high speed. An old-fashioned car has left the ferry in Assens at the same time as the motorcycle. They try to overtake the car on the road, but the driver won't let them pass. When they take a chance on his right side, the motorcycle smashes into a tree. The Ferryman takes the bodies of the man and the woman on his boat to the land of the dead.
This short movie is meant as a propaganda against fast driving. In 1948 there where no speed limits in Denmark (and only few motor vehicles) but it began to be a problem. The movie tells about a young couple driving on a motorbike to reach the ferry. But death is out after them, as a truck driver on the road. The question is if they will make the ferry, have an appointment with death or both?
