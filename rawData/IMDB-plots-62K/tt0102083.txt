After witnessing an act of unprecedented violence without even flinching, an emotionally numb real-estate agent visits his ailing mother at the hospital, and then, the graveyard. Is there a speck of happiness in this cruel and short life?
A plain, ordinary man tells us about his work as a real-estate broker, his dead father, his ordinary home and so on in a naturalistic voice, lacking any emotions, looking straight into the camera.
Having lost his father fourteen years ago, a demure and emotionally barren real-estate agent visits his ailing mother at the hospital, and then, the graveyard, after witnessing an act of unprecedented violence without even flinching. This man leads a simple life--he has a wife, and a son; a nice job; an equally pleasing car, and a spacious bedroom--however, there is something missing in his life. Is it because his only friend is his little brother or is it because another man has the nerve to ignore his debt to him? In the end, is there a speck of happiness in this cruel and short life for a humble broker?
