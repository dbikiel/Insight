A diverse group of 8th graders in New York City vie for a coveted spot in one of the city's elite public schools by taking a single standardized test.
Hopes for a better life are pinned on the SHSAT scores of the dozen kids we follow as they prep for, take, and get test results. But is it fair to have a single test decide who gets to go to the best ("specialized") public schools and should these schools' ethnic makeup should better reflect NYC's population? This film follows a diverse group of kids as they start the school year, prepare for the test, take the test and ultimately get their results back.
