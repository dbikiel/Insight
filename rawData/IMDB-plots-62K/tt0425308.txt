A man who is being driven crazy by the noise in New York City decides to take vigilante action against it.
In long flashbacks, David Owen looks back to when he lived in Manhattan with his wife and baby. The unnecessary noises of the city interrupt his life to the point that he takes a baseball bat to the windshield of cars whose alarms are blaring. After a few arrests, his wife kicks him out. On his own, he learns to avoid arrest and leaves a calling card as "The Rectifier" when he breaks into an offending car. Gruska, an enterprising young reporter, tracks him down. He tells her his story, they become lovers, and she organizes a petition drive for a ballot initiative to ban car alarms. The mayor becomes the Rectifier's bÃªte noire. Can David fight City Hall and win?
A black comedy about a man caught in the most impossible of conundrums: in love with his hometown, New York City, but driven mad by its noise. Transforming himself into "The Rectifier", David takes on everyone from the schmuck who ignores his own car alarm to the city's most powerful citizen, the Mayor. As his daring grows, New Yorkers rally behind him inspiring David to win this fight by the most ingenious of schemes.
