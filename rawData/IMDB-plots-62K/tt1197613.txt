Charlie Valentine (Raymond J. Barry), notorious crime boss/mobster, attempts to pull one last heist before slipping into "retirement". When the heist goes sour, however, he's forced to go on the run. Seeking help from his estranged son, Danny (Michael Weatherly), Valentine finds himself teaching his son the tricks of the trade. After an attempted scam on Danny's boss, and with a mobster on his tail, Valentine must decide whether or not he has enough goodness in himself to save his only son...a son who might die thanks to Valentine's mistakes.
