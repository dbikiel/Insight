A workaholic father who attempts to visit his daughter during a layover in LA, only to discover that she's disappeared, is forced to team up with her awkward ex-boyfriend to find her over the course of one transformative night.
Six months after that awkward introductory dinner with the tough and workaholic father of his girlfriend Ginnie, Martin, a talented but broke banjo musician, finds Mr Gallo knocking on his door looking for his daughter. Still heartbroken after breaking up with Ginnie, single and clueless, Martin will have no other choice but to hit the road and form an improbable search party with his ex-father-in-law, in an all-night adventure all over west Hollywood. Eventually, by the end of the night, the team will learn how to leave the past behind, move on, and most importantly, open their eyes and live. Nevertheless, where could Ginnie be?
