A series of interviews are conducted concerning people's beliefs towards the possibility of an afterlife. The interviews are filmed against a set of strange backdrops, and are intercut with clips from classic films and a variety of stock footage.
A wide variety of ordinary people of all ages share their thoughts, feelings and beliefs on a number of questions posed to them by director Diane Keaton (who is notably never actually seen or heard throughout the film), all having to do with the concept of Heaven and the Afterlife. Interspersed with their comments are a large number of clips from old movies and TV shows, brilliantly edited and used to striking, and sometimes hilarious, effect. The interviewees' responses run the gamut from hilariously inane and insane to insightful and thoughtful to startlingly candid, personal and revealing to poignant, moving and almost profound. Whatever the case, it's never dull, and the rich variety of old footage intermingled throughout is simply astonishing, and very effective. Clearly a great deal of time and thought went into the making of this film, and it paid handsome dividends. Altogether, a very engaging and entertaining film, and well-deserving of more attention than it's been given.
