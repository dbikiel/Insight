The Black Mask must stop a group intent on setting off a DNA bomb that could cause mutations to the human race.
Genetic modification means Black Mask has superhuman fighting and healing powers. He is searching the world for top geneticists who might be able to reverse his mutation, which has stolen his ability to feel emotion. His maker, whom he's running from has an amateur rival in this sequel though. Someone is hybridizing the DNA of top pro-wrestlers with that of animals, making them stronger and deadlier. But the process is turning the wrestlers (Iguana, Chameleon (Traci Lords), Snake, Wolf, and Claw) slowly more into animal killers, than human-beings. Black Mask tries to help the wrestlers but their boss has plans for BM himself.
