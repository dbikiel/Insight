A no-nonsense drifter leads a ragtag collective surrounded by a deadly tribe of Apaches.
Logan Cates, a drifter, is traveling through Apache country. He is joined by a few civilians and a small band of soldiers at a water hole when they get pinned down by Apaches. Unable to get away, the small party is killed one by one as the food and water supply dwindles. But then the storm that Cates was waiting for comes up, and using gun powder, he puts his escape plan into action.
Drifting through Apache country in Arizona, drifter Logan Cates (Rory Calhoun)takes command of an ill-assorted group, which includes Jennifer Fair (Barbara Bates) and Grant Kimbrough (John Dehner) when they are besieged by Apaches at Papago Wells. Their food, water give out and, for some, their courage. When a dust storm hits, Cates leads the survivors in a desperate attack against the Indians.
