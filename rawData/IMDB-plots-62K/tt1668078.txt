An impoverished village school-teacher's problems mount after winning a car.
After returning from Mumbai to Kanta in Uttarakhand, Ramesh Majita, who lives a poor lifestyle with his mother; wife Hema; son Baju; and sister-in-law Deepa, takes on the job of a school-teacher in a building which is over-run by mice. He decides to canvas the village folk into building a Kala Kendra while his friend, Basant, enters his name in a draw to win a car. To their surprise, he is indeed awarded the car - making him the only one to own one in the entire village - much to the chagrin of local contractor Jwar Singh. Ramesh quickly learns how to drive - but will soon find out that he has to maintain his car - especially when it gets damaged, and a mechanic has to be called from out of town. He finds out that Basant has borrowed money to repair the car; while Jwar will ask him to drive the car at a competition to pay off the debt - to which he agrees - but changes his mind at the last moment. His car will then taken over by Jwar's goons for losses incurred, but Sundar and Basant will assist him in locating it's whereabouts. Soon an enraged Jwar will accuse him of stealing the car and ask him to re-pay the debt - leaving him to ponder who would have stolen the car from Jwar's property.
