Using previously unreleased archival material in addition to contemporary interviews, this academy award-winning documentary tells the story of the Frank family and presents the first fully-rounded portrait of their brash and free-spirited daughter Anne, perhaps the world's most famous victim of the Holocaust.
This moving documentary focuses on young Jewish girl Anne Frank, who became world-renowned after her diary was published. The film relates how Anne and her family tried to survive Nazi persecution in Amsterdam by hiding in her father's office building, aided by trusted friends. Featuring the voices of Glenn Close and Kenneth Branagh, the award-winning movie also includes interviews with people who knew the Franks, most notably Miep Gies, who risked death to help shelter the family.
