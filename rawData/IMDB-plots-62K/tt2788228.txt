Following a brief affair, gym teacher Jurgen decides to marry his fellow teacher Sibel. But that's not what their families expected: Jurgen's Flemish parents don't understand why their only son dumped his previous girlfriend to marry a colleague; while Sibel's Turkish brother is agitated by her impulsive decision. Jurgen and Sibel look forward to their big day. But are they marrying just each other, or are they marrying their families as well? A comedy about French fries and baklava; about marriage and trust; about Flemish modesty versus Turkish temperament.
Young gym teacher JURGEN is marrying his attractive colleague SIBEL. But their families aren't all that enthusiastic about the wedding. Jurgen's mother MARIE-JEANNE is skeptical about her son's all too brief whirlwind affair while Sibel's brother KEMAL is aghast at his parent's permission for the match. And Jurgen and Sibel come to understand that they're not merely marrying each other: they're marrying a whole family of strangers. Their love for each other is put to the ultimate test on what is supposed to be the happiest day of their lives... MARRY ME is a comedy on French Fries vs. Baklava, on love vs. family and on Belgian romance vs. Turkish temperament.
