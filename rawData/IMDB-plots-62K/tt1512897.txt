3 ex/potentially ex couples in Copenhagen, interconnected by extramarital affairs or work at the theater, are having problems as are their kids.
The lives of an intertwined group of people take a new direction as all they have taken for granted starts to change. Anne and Ask's relationship succumbs to 'metal fatigue', Charlotte realizes that Carl may not be right for her, while Bente has to decide if she is prepared to wait forever for her lover, while her ex-husband Bj√∏rn must face the pain of finally letting her go. The characters and their children are twirled around in an ever-increasing drama which peaks during the opening night of Hamlet. Anne is on stage as Ophelia, and the question remains: to be or not to be responsible for one's own happiness.
