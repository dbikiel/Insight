Barbie comes to life in her third animated movie, based on the beloved fairy tale and set to the brilliant music of Tchaikovsky. Barbie as Odette, the young daughter of a baker, follows a unicorn into the Enchanted Forest and is transformed into a swan by an evil wizard intent on defeating the Fairy Queen.
Pivoting around Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's unforgettable fairy tale, Barbie, the summer camp counsellor, gives life to the beloved Odette, as she tries to comfort her little sister, Shelly, with the famous fable. As the spectacular story unfolds, a fascinating realm awaits, as Odette follows Lila, the stray unicorn, deep into the Enchanted Forest, where she discovers that she is destined to defeat the evil wizard, Rothbart. However, the powerful magician has cast a terrible spell on Odette--by night, the young girl keeps her human form, while, by day, she transforms into a glorious swan. Can the brave daughter of the village's baker thwart the sorcerer's plans, and let love rule?
