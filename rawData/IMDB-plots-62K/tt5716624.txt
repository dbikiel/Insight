Sebastian is on a business trip to Tokyo. Handsome and hip, he represents a high-end Brooklyn men's grooming product company that has been finding much success in Japan. But while his business is going well, there's a sadness in him that's not hard to notice- a past that's haunting him. He's also fascinated with a beautiful and mysterious woman he has seen at his hotel, Claire. They keep running into each other. There's clearly an attraction there between these two strangers. And so begins an erotic, highly charged night between these two Americans traveling in a foreign land. But all is not what it seems. Truth is fiction, and fiction the new reality. And these stranger's dark pasts have more in common than you might think.
