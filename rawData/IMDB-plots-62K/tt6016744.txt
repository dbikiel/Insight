Political documentary and personal memoir collide in this exploration into the complex truth behind the unraveling of two Brazilian presidencies.
A cautionary tale for these times of democracy in crisis, the personal and political fuse in The Edge of Democracy to explore one of the most dramatic periods in Brazilian history. Combining unprecedented access to Presidents Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff with accounts of her own family's complex political and industrial past, filmmaker Petra Costa (Elena, 2012) witnesses their rise and fall and the tragically polarized nation that remains.
Narrated and directed by Petra - the granddaughter of the founder of Andrade Gutierrez - the documentary unravels Brazil's latest political developments and corruption scandals as it shows the power of people's pressure on Congress, making them impeach one of the most powerful and corrupt governments Brazil has ever faced.
