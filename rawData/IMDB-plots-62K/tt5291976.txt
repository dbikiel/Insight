Europe has closed its borders to millions of refugees. Only Germany offers citizenship - if you survive the TV show "Immigration Game" In this manhunt through Berlin, every citizen can become a "Hunter" to track down and kill refugees in order to stop them from winning their German citizenship. When Joe, an aspiring bank manager and soon-to-be father, protects a wounded refugee "Runner" and accidentally kills a "Hunter" in self-defense, he faces a life sentence - unless he participates in the deadly game himself. Hunted by gangs of score-hungry teenagers, nationalists, and sadists Joe must now learn to fight and kill in order to win the game and return to his family.
'Immigration Game' is set in an alternate 2016. Germany refuses to receive any more refugees. The only way to obtain a residence permit is to participate in the popular Internet and television show 'Immigration Game'. Whoever participates as a 'Runner' in 'Immigration Game' will be abandoned on the outskirts of Berlin and must make their way to the television tower at Alexanderplatz. For a prize money every German citizen may chase and eventually kill the refugees entirely unpunished.
