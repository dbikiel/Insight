When a self-centered doctor is diagnosed with cancer, he becomes better able to empathize with his patients and appreciate a life outside his career.
Jack McKee is a doctor with it all: he's successful, he's rich, extremely self centred and he has no problems.... until he is diagnosed with throat cancer. Now that he has seen medicine, hospitals, and doctors from a patient's perspective, he realises that there is more to being a doctor than surgery and prescriptions, and more to life than serving only his own needs.
After spending his life, his career, as a physician who treated patients with less than the respect than they deserved. He becomes a patient himself and suddenly understands what it is like to be treated like he treated so many human beings who's feelings and emotions surrounding their illnesses he never stopped to consider. Karma has come to visit and he is not prepared. He assumed that because he was a physician, that he would be treated differently than the average patient. That he would have special privileges and accommodations afforded to him due to his station he so wrongly assumed he had. Every doctor should have to see this movie as part of their humanities training, perhaps then they would be less likely to lose their empathy along the way.
