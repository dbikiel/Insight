Far behind the lines Vahe receives the news of his father's death. Small boy neither could accept it nor reconcile himself with the new family of his mother who married to another man.

And, indeed, his father comes back after two years of guerilla warfare. But he must leave for war again as soon as his injury is healed. Vahe must be strong enough to withstand the blow.
