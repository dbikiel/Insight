In the army, he fits like the proverbial square peg, and deserts...to find his former henchman selling the mob's services to enemy spies and saboteurs. Meanwhile, Jill, the attractive WAC he's taken hostage, hopes to reform him (by any means at her disposal). But it takes an unexpected plot twist to make Jordan change his ways...
