Famous lake in Carpathian mountains - lake Synevir is known for it's rich history throughout the hundreds of years as a place of mystical unexplained events. There is a group of students who decided to spend a weekend at the lake. They did not believe in those stories about lake Synevir and strange creatures around it. Too bad.
