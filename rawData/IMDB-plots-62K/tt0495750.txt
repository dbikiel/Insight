The story of a group of courageous musicians who form a band in a West African refugee camp to keep their hope alive.
We meet musicians at the Sembakounya refugee camp in Guinea, men displaced by civil war in Sierra Leone. Reuben and Franco started the group, called the Refugee All Stars Band. Reuben sings, Franco plays guitar; both write songs. They became refugees in June, 1997, thinking they might be there for six months or a year. Years later, the All Stars have additional members. Reuben, Franco, and Arihim talk about what the band means: entertainment and, as Franco says, a chance to forget a bit. We see adults and children dancing.
