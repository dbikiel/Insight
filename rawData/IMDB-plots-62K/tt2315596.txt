After escaping a set up, a dying hitman returns to his hometown of Galveston where he plans his revenge.
A noirish crime thriller, Galveston centers on New Orleans hitman Roy Cady, diagnosed with lung cancer at 40. Before the cancer can do him in, however, he has more pressing concerns in the form of his mobster boss, who has decided to remove him from the business - and the world - via a set-up. Turning the tables, he goes on the run having rescued teenage hooker Raquel "Rocky" Arceneaux. He's persuaded to pick up her baby sister Tiffany, and with his new wards in tow, heads to his titular hometown to scheme revenge and redemption.
Galveston follows two hard-luck outsiders on the run. Barely surviving an assassination attempt from his loan-sharking boss, debt-collector Roy Cady flees to the Texas town to lie low, but in rescuing Raquel "Rocky" Arceneaux, a vulnerable young prostitute, from the shoot-out, any hope of a safe haven vanishes. Rocky is a girl with secrets to hide, including one that will forever haunt Roy in a powerful story of sacrifice and redemption.
