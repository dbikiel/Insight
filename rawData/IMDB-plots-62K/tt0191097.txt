A mad scientist creates the band Music Brigades from body parts of dead musicians.
Freshly arrived from the mystical forests of the ancient Carpathian Mountains, the deranged scientist and Count Dracula's direct descendant, Dr Victor Papadopoulos, has settled in his new castle, somewhere in the thick shadows of Exarchia. Burning with artistic desire and deeply devoted to his paranoid cause, the delusional doctor roams the city's empty night streets in search of human limbs that once belonged to famous musicians, with the intention of putting together the perfect rock band. However, the cemetery's restless inhabitants who are at the end of their tether, decide to form an alliance to fight back the rapacious gravedigger and put an end to this blasphemy once and for all. But who can stand in Dracula's way?
