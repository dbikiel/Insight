When the girl he likes goes missing, Jake enlists the help of his grandpa and Grandpa's former special ops buddies.
Jake Bouchard, a shy 17-year-old, has finally scored a date with the incredibly wonderful Angie. When Angie gets kidnapped, the truth about Grandpa comes out. In a last ditch effort to rescue Angie, Grandpa re-enlists "The Devil's Scum", his old special ops unit who band together with Jake to go on one last mission.
Jake believes his retired grandfather is senile, concocting fanciful stories of his life as a U.S. special missions operative, but when Angie, a girl who's caught his special interest, disappears without a trace, Jake's grandfather proves all the stories true. The pair embark on a hunt for the missing Angie, along the way reuniting Grandpa with his old over-the-hill gang, known as the Devil's Scum.
