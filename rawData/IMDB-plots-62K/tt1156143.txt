A quirky woman who spends her free time as a pilot has her purse stolen; when a mysterious man finds her wallet, they embark on a peculiar romance.
A wallet lost and found opens the door to romantic adventure for Georges and Marguerite. After examining the ID papers of its owner, it is not a simple matter for Georges to turn the red wallet he found in to the police. Nor is it that Marguerite can recuperate her wallet without being piqued with curiosity about whom it was who found it. As they navigate the social protocols of giving and acknowledging thanks, turbulence enters their otherwise quotidian lives.
The mysteries of emotions. Marguerite is a dentist and weekend pilot. A kid on a skateboard steals her purse, and Georges, an older man, finds her wallet, is intrigued by her ID photos, tries to call her, and turns the wallet in to the police. Marguerite calls to thank him; he's rude on the phone then tries to apologize by letters and calls. She dismisses him, reports his stalking to the police, then wants to apologize. So it goes, back and forth. Georges' long suffering wife Suzanne is resigned, Marguerite's friend and business partner Josepha wants Georges gone. Will this end in an embrace? Are emotions as random as events such as a found wallet?
