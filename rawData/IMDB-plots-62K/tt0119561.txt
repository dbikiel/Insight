The story of the post World War II Jewish refugee situation from liberation to the establishment of the modern state of Israel.
After WWII, Jewish Holocaust survivors are moved into Displaced Persons' camps. After delays, more physical hardship, and years of uncertainty, they are permitted to begin new lives in Israel and the U.S.
At the end of World War II, Holocaust survivors are freed from Nazi internment camps. For many of them, the joy quickly turns to despair, as most have no families and nowhere to go. Because of quotas imposed by the British, thousands are unable to legally immigrate to Palestine. Many are put into displaced persons camps to await relocation. Meanwhile, the world powers work toward the creation of Israel as a homeland for all Jews. Morgan Freeman narrates this moving documentary.
This documentary reports events for European Jews from the fall of the Third Reich in 1945 to the formation of the state of Israel in 1948, arguing that creating the Israeli state was necessary given the nature of post-war Europe for these survivors. We see death in concentration camps after liberation, from disease or even from eating too much. We learn of pogroms murdering those who return home. We see the squalor of displaced persons camps. Facing strict British immigration limits into Palestine, many sought passage illegally, often ending up in locked camps in Cyprus. Against this backdrop, Jews in Palestine, Truman in the White House, and UN delegates debate Israel's formation.
