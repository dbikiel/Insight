The story of two brothers who get involved with a sexy stripper and her boss, the nightclub king of Santiago, as told from three perspectives. Sexy, gritty, emotional.
Parents, children, brothers. A few days in Santiago, Chile, seen by three different characters: Víctor, a schoolboy who develops a crush on a stripper he sees at a club on his birthday; Silvio, Victor's older brother, hired by the club owner to be his driver and who also falls for the woman; and, Gracia, the stripper who's the boss's girlfriend and who wants out. The club owner, Don Pasqual, has many illegal enterprises and a bad heart. Víctor's impulsive puppy love, Silvio's libido, Gracia's plans, and Don Pasqual's possessiveness make for a dangerous mix.
