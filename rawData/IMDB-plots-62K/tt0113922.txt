The movie is built around the very complex relationships between Yoshida, leaving Shimizu for Aihara (or at least he tries to), and his friend Ito, whose love for Yoshida seems to have little chance for success. In the end we have a coalition of Ito and Aihara - who may or may not be in love with Ito - teaching Yoshida a lesson.
A realistic movie about the struggles of a few teenagers (about 18) of a school in Japan. One of the boys has fallen in love with his best friend and can not hide this any longer. The movie tries to create understanding for his homosexual feelings by showing a parallel development of a relation between a boy and a girl.
