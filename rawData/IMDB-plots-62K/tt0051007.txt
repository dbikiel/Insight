The class of 1941 at Carson High School is holding its 15th reunion. "Boy Most Likely To Succeed" Fred Davis is in town to sell his house before taking a job in San Francisco; he's been wandering from town to town since leaving college. "Most Popular Girl" Maggie Brewster is a successful real estate agent, but her very close relationship with her father seems to make any other man fall short in her eyes. While Maggie's best friend, "happily" married Barna, spends time with Jack, who still lives on the high school football field, Fred and Maggie renew their friendship and find the years haven't been as full as they should have been.
