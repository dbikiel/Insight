An American company inadvertently unleashes a magnetic vortex on an unprepared world.
Helios World Inc. aims to solve the world's energy crisis by gathering and transmitting energy from solar flares. Despite warnings of a design flaw from the developing scientist, company head Jonathan Kane pushes the project forward and unknowingly unleashes a free-ranging and self-perpetuating magnetic vortex. Only Michael Edwards, a leading scientist on the company team, thinks something might be amiss when a sizable portion of their harvested energy simply disappears. The general area thereafter discovers itself endangered by a roving and unprecedented problem growing rapidly in strength - unique, unpredictable and potentially unstoppable. As if this isn't bad enough, the Paris branch of Helios World is set to run the same flawed program and thereby birth a second voracious monster in Europe.
