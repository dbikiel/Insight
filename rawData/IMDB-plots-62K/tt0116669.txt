Because of an unusual disorder that has aged him four times faster than a typical human being, a boy looks like a 40-year-old man as he starts fifth grade at public school after being homeschooled.
Jack Powell was born with a unique disorder that causes him to age four times faster than people usually age, so when he's 10 years old he looks 40. This causes problems when he starts public school and tries to make friends with his classmates.
