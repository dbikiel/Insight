A jilted man (Jean-Paul Belmondo) rants at his mostly silent former lover (Anne Collette).
After dating for three months, Charlotte breaks up with her boyfriend Jules, a writer, for another man, a filmmaker who Jules believes is only a means to further her acting career. One week later, Charlotte returns to Jules' apartment. Jules embarks on a diatribe about their relationship, past and present. Jules admits that he still loves her, and that her return proves that she still loves him, but it is questionable on his part how easily he will take her back. If Jules does end up letting Charlotte get a word in edgewise, he may discover the answers to their relationship questions from Charlotte's perspective.
