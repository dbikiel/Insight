Two Texas border guards, a young hotshot and his older and more cynical partner, find a jeep buried for 20 years in the desert, with a skeleton, a scoped rifle, and a box with $800,000 in cash. They decide to keep the money, but quietly check up on the cryptic info they've found on the dead driver. Soon, the Feds are running all over the place, and it looks like the jeep may be linked to the JFK assassination. But the Feds are trying to cover it up, and eliminate anyone who knows about the jeep.
It began as a stroke of incredible luck for two United States Border Patrol agents, Bob Logan and Ernie Wyatt. Partners and pals who enjoyed good whiskey and bad women. They accidentally discover a jeep buried in the Texas desert for over 20 years with $850,000 in cash in a metal container; a second metal container that holds a fishing rod and a high powered rifle. And finally a skeleton of a man in the drivers seat. They find his wallet with only a Texas drivers license and a piece of paper with a phone number and a Washington, D.C. area code. It should have been their ticket to a first class life if they played it "smart". If they played it "stupid" they could wind up like the skeleton in the jeep. Logan wants to take the money and run; Wyatt wants to at least try and find out who is the skeleton in the jeep. What was in store for both of them is something much more terrifying. A chilling drama of friendship, intrigue and murder.
