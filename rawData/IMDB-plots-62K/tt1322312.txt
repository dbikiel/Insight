A romantic comedy centered on a guy and a gal who try to keep their love alive as they shuttle back and forth between New York and San Francisco to see one another.
Erin has just six more weeks as an intern at the New York Sentinel before she returns to San Francisco. That's fine with Garrett since he just got out of a relationship. But their relationship blossoms and it quickly becomes something that they can't just drop in six weeks. They admit to wanting to be boyfriend/girlfriend just on opposite coasts. The distance wears on them, as with their nay-saying friends and sister, and soon they are forced to either break up or come up with a solution that has them living in the same city.
Erin's 31, a journalism grad student at Stanford and, for the summer, an intern at a New York daily. She meets Garrett at a bar, they hit it off, and, for the rest of the summer, are inseparable. But, can the relationship grow - or even survive - at a distance? Erin, who put her professional life on hold once before for a man, gets advice from her married sister, Corinne, and he gets running commentary from his best friend Box and his roommate Dan - both clueless about women. Garrett, who doesn't much like his job at a record company, looks for work in the Bay Area, Erin tries to find a reporting job in New York, but as these efforts fail, is there any hope for them as a couple?
