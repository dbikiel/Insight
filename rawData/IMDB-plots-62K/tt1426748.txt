Losers Take All is a comedy in which we follow "The Fingers," a fictional punk-pop band stumbling and staggering their way in the opposite direction of mainstream success, circa 1986. Fingers are faced with the unlikely opportunity of committing the ultimate indie rock sin: selling out. Do they stay true to their non-commercial DIY sound and ethos? Do they get in bed with corporate rock? Or do they simply keep getting wasted and implode into oblivion?
