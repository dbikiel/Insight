Pierre Niemans faces the threat of the apocalypse while investigating a series of ritual murders.
Chief Niemans is investigating a series of ritual murders: The victims are crucified. He teams up with young officer Reda, who gets embroiled after a man dressed as a monk tries to kill a confused guy Reda picked up on the street. Together with a specialist on christian mythology they uncover a mysterious group called "Angels of the Apokalypse".
In Lorraine, close to the border of Germany, the Chief Inspector Pierre Niemans is investigating the death of a man behind of a wall of an isolated abbey. Meanwhile, the efficient detective Reda is investigating the attempt of murder of a man called Jesus. They come to the same point along their investigations, join forces with the detective Marie, a specialist in religious matter, and fight against Heinrich von Garten, a German Minister of Culture and Religion, a group of powerful monks.
After a body is found in the walls of a French monastery, Commissioner Niemans, played by Jean Reno, once again teams up with his old partner, Detective Reda, played by Benoit Magimel, who was already investigating his own murder. As with the first movie, the pair's investigations intertwine and soon they are looking at a giant conspiracy involving a group of monks on steroids lead by Heinrich von Garten, played by Christopher Lee. Reno and Magimel are joined by a religious specialist called Marie, played by Camille Natta.
