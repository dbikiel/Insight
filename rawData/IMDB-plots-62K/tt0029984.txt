While Charlie is distracted with the birth of his first grandchild, son Jimmy impersonates his father in order to investigate a murder aboard a freighter in the harbor.
With Charlie Chan distracted by the imminent birth of his first grandchild, young Tommy Chan persuades his older brother Jimmy (eager to be a detective) to take Pop's place when a call comes in directing Charlie to investigate a murder aboard a freighter. Charlie eventually learns of this and boards the ship to straighten out its slew of suspects, a cargo hold full of wild animals, and two well-meaning but ineffectual sons.
When murder is committed on the good ship Susan B Jennings, Charlie has just left home. Young son Tommy takes the phone call when Charlie is assigned the case and persuades elder brother Jimmy (who wants to be a detective) to accept the assignment. Jimmy goes out to the ship himself (secretly followed by Tommy), where he's mistaken for his father as he proceeds to examine the case. Charlie finally finds out and rushes to the harbor where he straightens things out and begins to investigate. Among the suspects is a doctor who keeps a living human brain in a suitcase in order to continue experiments on it, a police detective who is taking in a prisoner and seems keenly interested in Chan's case, and a nervous fellow who nevertheless is escorting a pet lion. $300,000 gets stolen, another passenger is murdered, and the Captain of the freighter is putting pressure on the Honolulu Police Department to let him take the ship out of the harbor and precede on its way before the shipping company loses too much money.
