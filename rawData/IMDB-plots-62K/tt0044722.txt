Two brothers end up on opposite sides of the law in post-Civil War Texas.
Home from the Civil War, young Neal Hammond is happy to return to Texas ranching, but brother Dan wants more. His attempt to enter business is thwarted when carpetbagger Cord Hardin beats and humiliates him in a poker game. So Dan forms a rustling gang and parlays his ill-gotten gains into a land empire. But among the growing opposition to his gang is the new Marshal of Austin...brother Neal.
After the American Civil War, the brothers Dan and Neil Hammond return to their father's ranch H Circle in Austin, Texas with their friend Tiny. Greedy Dan does not adapt to ranching again and has the intention of raising a fortune of his own. He borrows one thousand dollars from a friend and plays cards with the wealthy Cord Hardin. However he loses five thousand dollars and Hardin humiliates Dan. He recruits dangerous deserters to form a gang, and together they steal the cattle of Cord and other ranchers. Dan raises a large amount of money and returns to Austin, lying that he made a fortune in New Orleans. When Cord kidnaps Neil to interrogate him about his brother's business, Cord's wife Lorna goes to the hotel and tells Dan what is happening at the ranch.
