Naruto and his team are hired to protect a young actress from three rogue warriors in the Land of the Snow.
Naruto Uzumaki the ninja-in-training knuckle-headed and his team are sent on a mission to guard Yukie Fujikaze, a popular actress starring the hit movie "The Adventures of Princess Gale." The crew is heading toward the Land of Snow, a land forever covered in snow, to shoot the final scenes of the film. When Yukie refuses to go and escapes from the set, she is brought back by force by Naruto and his teammates. But little do they know there are three rouge Snow Ninja lying in wait with a sinister purpose that forces Yukie to make a crucial decision and face her hidden past.
After a rousing game of hide-n-seek with Konohamaru, Naruto and the gang are on the next big mission. Their task is to escort the beautiful actress Fujimi Yukihime to a far off mountain where the sequel to last summer's mega box office smash hit movie is being filmed. Upon their arrival, ghosts show up and try to scare everyone anyway from the movie set. Everyone is confused why they would want the movie to stop being made; so Naruto and the gang vow to find out who is behind the scaring and capture them.
