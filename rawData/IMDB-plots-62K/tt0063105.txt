The indomitable martial arts team of director Chang Cheh and stunt choreographer Liu Chia-liang continues the compelling saga of Golden Swallow from King Hu's Come Drink with Me in this sequel of heartbreaking romance, jianghu intrigue and stunning action.
Golden Swallow (Pei-Pei Cheng) is living peacefully with her "friend" ('Lo Lieh') by a waterfall. She has seemingly given up her death-dealing ways but soon she is accused of going on a bloody rampage against an evil clan. As it turns out, the actual culprit is an old beau named Silver Roc ('Jimmy Wang Yu') who is impersonating her to draw her out into the open. A complicated love triangle develops as her affections are torn between the two men while all three must also deal with the evil kungfu clan.
