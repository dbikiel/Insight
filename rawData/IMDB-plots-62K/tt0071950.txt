A woman is tormented by strange dreams of astronauts on the moon. She visits a deserted seaside town whose inhabitants know her even though she does not know them.
The translator Alice Cespi has nightmares with an astronaut left alone on the moon and is addicted in sleeping pills. When she goes to work, she is fired since she missed three days without any justification. She returns home and finds a torn postcard of the Garma Hotel in Garma and decides to visit the seaside touristic place. She stumbles upon the weird girl Paola Bersel, the stranger Harry and other locals that believe she is a woman called Nicole. Along the days, Alice tries to unravel the mystery of her missing days.
A woman awakens to discover she has no memories of the previous three days and her only clue to follow is the torn photo of a seaside town. Upon visiting the town to hopefully restore her memory, the woman becomes confused when locals appear to recognize her even though she doesn't remember ever being there. A recurring dream involving astronauts on the Moon offers little comfort and more concern for the amnesiatic women.
