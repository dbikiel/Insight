The story of Moominpappa who smokes a pipe and trying on a new hat.
Spring. All the inhabitants of Mumi-doll do wake up after hibernation. Everyone began to do their own thing - Mumi-mama began sweeping the yard, Mumi-troll girlfriend Snork began to do her hair, Mumi-troll and Snusmumrik began to sing a song, sitting on the bridge across the river, and Mumi-papa, smoking his pipe, began to read the morning newspaper. And so Mumi-troll and Snusmumrik saw that a cylinder swam under the bridge. They raised it and brought him home. There it was tried on by Mumi-papa. But the hat was not simple, but magic.
