When Jan decides to marry his girl-friend Sara, he is not aware of his opponent: her father, who is an Italian patriarch. Antonio won't hear of a wedding anywhere else than in Campobello, his hometown in southern Italy. Jan is faced with an overwhelmingly large Italian family, forced to discover new traits in his bride once she's embraced her Italian side, and looking forward to a lifetime of being the fifth wheel. But by and by, he also realizes that Antonio, who left his family for Germany when he was young and married a German woman later, knows all these feelings first-hand and doesn't like him the less for them. Still, there is the question: Should Jan and Sara really get married?
