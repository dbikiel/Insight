Linda and Eta, two 14-year-old girls, best of friends, retreat to a secluded beach beneath the cliffs of Dubrovnik; the morning after, only one of them returns.
Linda and Eta are best friends. They are 14 years old and live in Dubrovnik: Eta with her mother and grandmother, Linda with her father, who is a heart specialist at the local hospital and once lived in Switzerland, where Linda was born. The two girls are inseparable, although they often are drawn into fierce arguments. Together, they sneak into discos, fight over boys, and dream about an exciting future beyond their quaint hometown. One of their favorite places is the pine forest of Petka Hill on the outskirts of the city. On the first warm spring day, Eta and Linda retreat to a secret beach beneath the cliffs of Petka Hill. Once again they have an argument, this time with horrific consequences. Eta is left for dead on a rock by the sea, while Linda spends the night wandering aimlessly through the forest. However, the inhabitants of Dubrovnik don't want to know about the guilt and desolation plaguing Linda after her friend's death. The sunny, Mediterranean harbor town now seems sinister and full of secrets. Linda finds herself alone, with nowhere to turn and she unwittingly falls under the spell of Eta's mother and grandmother, who strangely treat her as if she were Eta. Linda's life gradually becomes interwoven with that of her deceased friend; step by step she seems to penetrate further and further into Eta's life as her own identity begins to dissolve, as if the two friends, the living and the dead, were mysteriously merging...
