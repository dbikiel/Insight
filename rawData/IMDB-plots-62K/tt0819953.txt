Jean-Marc Leblanc (Labr√®che), a desperate civil servant, escapes reality as we all know it, to imagine himself as the hero in imaginary adventures.
Jean-Marc is a man without qualities living in times that are out of joint. His wife and children ignore him; he's a mid-level civil servant in Montreal doing his job without care. He has an active imagination of sexual conquest, but his only real feelings come when he visits his aged mother, whose health is failing. When his wife leaves abruptly to work in Toronto, Jean-Marc sets out to reorder things with his daughters, his social life, and at work. In a world that at best is a farce, does he stand a chance?
