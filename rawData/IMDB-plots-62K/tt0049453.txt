Although she is on the most part content with her current lot in life, widowed New Yorker Ann feels that her adolescent daughter, Peggy, needs a father. Ann starts dating Larry, an old friend who has just returned to New York from working in South America. Peggy seems to have a good time with Larry, but she also resents Larry and Ann's alone time as man and woman. When Peggy learns that Ann and Larry are thinking about getting married, Peggy's resentment grows. She starts acting out and making Larry's life with her and her mom more and more difficult. What ensues is a three-way battle of wills.
