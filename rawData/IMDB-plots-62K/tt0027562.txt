Alexander Botts is a self-described natural born salesman and master mechanic, who is trying to make a big sale of Earthworm tractors to grouchy lumberman Johnson. Since Botts doesn't really know anything about tractors, and since the old-fashioned Johnson is opposed to tractors of any kind, it isn't going to be an easy sell. But Botts perseveres, encouraged by Johnson's daughter.
Author William Hazlett Upson turned his work experience with the Holt Caterpillar Company into a second career when "The Saturday Evening Post" published his first story in 1927 in the saga of tractor salesman extraordinare Alexander Botts and Earthworm crawlers. The series was so popular that it led to 112 Botts tales and a movie.
