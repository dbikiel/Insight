When three traitorous goddesses steal seven magical thunderbolts with unearthly power, it falls to one man with the strength of one hundred to save the universe from eternal chaos and darkness: Hercules. As an Olympian array of monstrous villains line up to claim Hercules' head, our protagonist must summon every last ounce of his formidable strength to defeat them all, recover the thunderbolts, and take to the cosmos itself for one final battle with his arch-nemesis, King Minos.
