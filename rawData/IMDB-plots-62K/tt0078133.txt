Lionel's life turns around after a one-night stand on top of a pinball table... he becomes the world's first pregnant man!
Twenty-four year old Angeleno Lionel Carpenter teaches a citizenship class at night school, most of his immigrant students who have no idea of what he is teaching in the language barrier. He has also had no luck with women largely due to the sheltered life he's led under the wings of his overbearing mother. His lack of encounters with women in the sexual sense is unlike his brash cousin, Sgt. Danny Bonhoff, who will do anything and take whatever opportunity to be up close and personal with the opposite sex. With Danny's help, Lionel is able to lose his virginity, although it isn't a totally satisfying experience. Regardless, Lionel learns that the reason for his nausea and vomiting following that encounter is because he got pregnant from it, he being the first male in recorded history to be so. By this time, he and one of his students, Russian gypsy Segoynia Savaka, have fallen in love and want to get married. They have to decide what to do about the baby. But the infamy and notoriety of Lionel's situation may not only dictate what happens about the baby, but whether Lionel and Segoynia's relationship can withstand the pressures.
