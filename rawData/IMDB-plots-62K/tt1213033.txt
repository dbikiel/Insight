Released under different titles in France--and not surprisingly, often confused with its analogous 1896 movie, "Le Manoir du Diable (1896)"--Georges Méliès' Haunted Castle is considered, by all means, a remake.
A man dressed in red is ushered into an antechamber in a Castle and offered a seat. When he tried to sit down the chair moves to the other side of the room causing the man to fall on the floor. Standing up he strides to the chair but on trying to lift it a Spector materializes in the chair, arises and challenges the man. The man pulls out his sword and lunges at the Spector but it changes into a skeleton. Seeing the change the man tried to grab the skeleton but it changes into an armor clad guard. The man attempts to move the guard but a devil appears and waves the man away. The man recoils from the devil and tries to leave but the Spector reappears. Both it and the devil frighten the man from the antechamber.
Released under different titles in France--and not surprisingly, often confused with its analogous 1896 movie, "Le manoir du diable (1896)"--Georges Méliès' Haunted Castle is considered, by all means, a remake. Once more, there are a plethora of supernatural manifestations and threatening apparitions, including ghosts, a creepy skeleton, a teleporting chair, and of course, the prince of darkness himself, however, this brief representation of the eternal battle between Good and Evil inserts an armoured phantom, and above all, is painstakingly coloured by hand. Nevertheless, who wins in the end?
