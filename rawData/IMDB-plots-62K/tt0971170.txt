This visually stunning directorial debut is set in a place lost in time in northern Argentina. Alvaro is a gay man who is an outsider. He works for the violent El Turo, a captain of the water bus which links isolated communities. But El Turo is threatened by Alvaro's sexuality and starts harassing him.
