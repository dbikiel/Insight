A cook has his hands full with three mischievous devils, who pop in and out of his kitchen.
In a spacious and busy kitchen, an enthusiastic and highly-skilled professional head chef who can't afford to lose a second is interrupted by a weary vagabond looking for some spare change, and, perhaps, a little taste of his mouth-watering creations. But alas. The haughty executive culinarian will soon discover that looks can be deceiving--especially when the poor panhandler he has just kicked out--is a magnificent and powerful mage in disguise. With the sorcerer's black servants all over the place, can the cook appease the insulted feelings?
Nothing seems to be going right for the busy cook. He has several helpers, but they are mostly talking and laughing and doing little, so, when an old beggar asks for a hand out, the harried cook boots him out. The beggar returns in his true aspect, he's a wizard, and all Hell breaks loose. An imp ruins the soup with too much spice, and the cook blames his helpers. The wizard conjures more imps, and various chases and tricks ensue as the imps pop in and out of the cook's large oven. Havoc reigns.
