A case of mistaken identity, by a switched Passport leaves a Georgian man stranded in Israel.
A man, who becomes mistaken for his brother who was immigrating to Israel from USSR, finds himself caught up in the middle of a beaurocratic mess when he realizes that if he tells the truth about who he is, he will go to jail and his brother's family will never be allowed to leave the USSR. He therefore assumes his brother's identity to get to Israel hoping his distant uncle living there will help him out. The plan backfires, however, when he realizes that the uncle is a paranoid lunatic thinking the KGB is out to get him. He becomes stranded in Israel with no friends, no money, and no passport, trying to figure out a way to get back home.
