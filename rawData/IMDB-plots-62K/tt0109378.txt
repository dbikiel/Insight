In August 1944, in chaotic post-war Italy, the former boxer, Dieci, organizes a troupe of five young starving men to fight for food and small change in villages avid to celebrate the end of the war. While heading to Monteriggioni in an old truck, Diece rescues the black American, private Washington, from an Italian family. Later he invites the fascist Rosa, who had her hair cut like a man to indicate that she was a traitor, to join the group. When they meet a troop of American soldiers, they are invited to exhibit in their base. Back on the road, they meet Wilma, who asks for a lift and invites them to a wedding party. During their trip, they learn lessons of life, friendship and betrayal.
