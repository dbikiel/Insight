An animated, musical version of Mark Twain's classic novel about the adventures of Tom Sawyer, along with his friends Huck Finn and Becky Thatcher. While spending most of his days avoiding school, work and his Aunt Polly, Tom manages to get himself into trouble on a regular basis. This trouble turns serious, though, when he and Huck witness Injurin' Joe commit a terrible crime and place the blame on his friend, Muff Potter. Though the two boys are terrified of what Joe might do to them, they know that the only way to save Muff is to tell the truth about what they have seen.
