The great adventure of 11-year-old Mik starts when he has to leave his home in search of a new one. Along the way, he learns about whales, fishing, friends and love. Forced to flee from the authorities, his friends join on an Ice Dragon.
With the heavy responsibility of keeping house for his former heavy-metal drummer and currently jobless alcoholic father, the eleven-year-old motherless boy, Mik, must depend on his own strength without any help from his older brother. But to make matters worse, just as Mik has finally adjusted to a new life with his aunt and a motley crew of good friends, the Swedish social services will have another bad surprise for the young orphan. Can a little boy alone turn his life around?
