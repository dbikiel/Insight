Three kingdoms have been overtaken by three evil lords and only Tyor, a teenage boy with magical powers, can restore peace to the land with the help of a bumbling elder, wizard and a hero in each kingdom. Tyor fights alongside them and eventually becomes a powerful wizard in his own right.
In a dark era surrounded by the mystical powers of shadow and sorcery, the realm of the Lost Kingdom has now succumbed to malevolent forces, after valiant Simon's heroic attempt to save the land in Wizards of the Lost Kingdom (1985). Entrusted with the crucial task of finding the only force on Earth that could save the world--Tyor, the Chosen One--Caedmon, the last of the white wizards, embarks on a peril-laden mission to defeat three evil warlocks, and reunite the life-giving Powers of Creation. However, Tyor is merely an apprentice sorcerer. Can Caedmon and Tyor thwart the wizards' sinister plans, and restore peace to the long-suffering kingdom?
