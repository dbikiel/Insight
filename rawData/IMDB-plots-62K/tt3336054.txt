A small polar bear learns some important life lessons while living on the Far North with his mother and meeting with human explorers.
In the far-distant North, the mother bear teaches her baby to make a den, and then tells an amazing tale about the sad fish the Sun, which cannot dodge the sharp teeth of a shark. Mom puts the bear to sleep and sings him lullaby. When the baby wakes up, he sees the sun, and even people who smell like smoke, walk on their hind legs and can take off their skin. But they should not be approached, because he needs to fish, which Umka still does not know how.
