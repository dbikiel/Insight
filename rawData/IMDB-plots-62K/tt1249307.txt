Puck Hogs follows a men's recreational hockey team, The Puck Hogs, through a brutally hilarious weekend tournament. In the tradition of the cult classic This is Spinal Tap, Puck Hogs is a hocku-mentary comedy about ice-prone boys turning into real-life men, and stick handling the puck over the goal line of life.
