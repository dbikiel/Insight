A writer of horror stories is invited to a "monster club" by a mysterious old gentleman. There, three gruesome stories are told to him; between each story some musicians play their songs.
A vampire invites his favorite horror author to a nightclub for monsters and shares three stories to inspire his next book: a con artist couple suffers the consequences when they attempt to take advantage of a wealthy recluse, who is sensitive about his monstrous pedigree; a suspicious stranger tricks a bullied child into endangering his vampire father; a film director looking for the perfect location to shoot a horror movie stumbles upon a village populated by monsters.
