Zobel and Karl are a long time gay couple who live together in a trailer home with Lizzie, Zobel's spunky daughter from a heterosexual misadventure. Together these three form a team of thieves who eke out an existence as pickpockets. After a botched job, Karl becomes unable to work, forcing Zobel and Lizzie to seek out a new partner. Lizzie recruits Rudolf, the boyishly charming town misfit. Reluctantly, Zobel allows Rudolf to join them but warns him to never break the golden rule: "No exchanging of bodily fluids within the team." This dictum becomes increasingly difficult to live by as Lizzie's cravings and Zobel's own passions toward Rudolf intensify. Eventually, the golden rule is broken by Lizzie...and then again by Zobel (unbeknownst to Lizzie, of course). An intricate love triangle soon develops amongst the three that is shaped by deception, desire, and betrayal.
Four people, taking what they can get and one person not getting what he desires - a family drama on the verge of love and death. Zobel and Karl have been a gay couple for a long time. Together with Zobel's daughter Lizzi they form the Trio, specialized in pickpocketing. But the love of Zobel and Karl has become frail. Lizzi stands between the two men that have been father and mother to her. Then Karl has an accident. A new man joins the Trio. Rudolf is young, curious and takes what he can get. Lizzi likes him and in Zobel he raises desires. The young man turns out to be a challenge for the small family that up to then seemed to be intact.
