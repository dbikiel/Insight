Follows the journey of sisters who are believed to possess the supernatural ability to connect with ghosts. They cross paths with a visionary French producer while performing in Paris.
In 1930s restless Paris, the American sisters and spiritual mediums Laura and Kate Barlow are an authentic psychic act touring pre-war Europe, where before an astounded audience, sceptical but curious spectators join them onstage for a hypnotic séance with the dearly departed. During a performance, a well-off film producer, André Korben, dazzled by the sisters' genuine psychic ability, will hire them for an ambitious film project which would contribute to the evolution of the French film industry, just by capturing even the faintest suggestion of a real paranormal manifestation. Little by little, the war creeps in and Korben's reputation rests entirely on the success of this single effort, nevertheless, are the Barlow Sisters nothing but an elaborate act or do they actually possess the dark gift?
