In the Gay Nineties, a seductive nightclub singer contends with several suitors, including a jealous escaped convict and a handsome temperance league member.
New York singer and nightclub owner Lady Lou has more men friends than you can imagine, unfortunately one of them is a vicious criminal who's escaped and is on the way to see "his" girl, not realizing she hasn't exactly been faithful in his absence. Help is at hand in the form of young Captain Cummings, a local temperance league leader, though.
Lady Lou is a successful saloon singer in the Bowery at local politico Gus Jordan's saloon. She's a popular gal with many men interested in her - though she too is interested in many men. Her jealous boyfriend Chick Clark is in prison and warns not to double cross him or he'll find a way out and kill her. Lou does take an interest in Captain Cummings, head of the Salvation Army-type Mission located next door. When she hears they can't pay the rent, she buys the building so they - and the Captain -can stay. When Clark breaks out of prison, he heads straight to Jordan's saloon. Meanwhile, Cummings isn't quite what he seems.
