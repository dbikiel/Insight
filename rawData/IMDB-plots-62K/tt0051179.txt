The friendship between a white man and an Apache chief is tested when they fall in love with the same woman during a time of frontier conflict.
Mexican girl Riva comes between two friends, Apache chief Mangas and trader Fargo, both of whom love the girl. She weds Mangas to the disappointment of Fargo and the dismay of Mangas's tribe. Fargo brokers peace between the Apache and the white settlers, but unscrupulous gold-hunters trigger war. It is up to Fargo to prevent a bloodbath.
