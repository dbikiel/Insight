After some rare gems go missing on a distant planet where men are not allowed, three soldiers posing as women are sent from Earth to aid in the investigation.
Three soldiers are ordered to change their gender (via a pill) and are sent on a secret mission (undercover as show girls) to the women only planet of Clitoris' capital city "Vegas in Space." Once they arrive, they must maneuver through complex politics and decadent parties, to uncover a plot to disrupt the most important pleasure planet in the Universe. Oh yeah, everyone except two of the "men" who become "women" is played by a drag queen, at least one is a dual role!
