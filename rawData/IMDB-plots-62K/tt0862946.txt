A wandering mystical doctor passes through remote regions of Japan uncovering supernatural creatures called the Mushi and curing people of their effects.
Ginko, a Mushi-shi has always been attuned to the Mushi, creatures close to life itself and able to affect and alter their surroundings. He cannot stay in one place for too long so he wanders, helping the inhabitants of rural Japan understand the Mushi around them and how to coexist peacefully.
