In 1994 Pedro Zamora was the first HIV-positive gay man to appear in a reality show on MTV. The audience of 'The Real World: San Francisco' identified easily with this intelligent, good-looking Latino. His presence on the show also meant that audiences in the United States and abroad had to engage with the topic of AIDS. A screen adaptation of Pedro Zamora's life: his childhood in Havana as the youngest of eight children, his immigration to the United States, his hard work as an AIDS activist, his appearance on 'The Real World' as well as the short time that was left to him subsequently.
