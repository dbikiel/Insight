Gordon Miller is rehearsing a musical comedy in the penthouse suite of Gribble's hotel...on credit. The mounting bill is driving Gribble frantic. Chaos increases when playwright Glen Russell, whose dramatic play he thinks Miller is producing, arrives. But it turns out Russell can sing like Sinatra, and Miller has leading lady Christine turn on the charm. Can Miller's crazed machinations save the show?
