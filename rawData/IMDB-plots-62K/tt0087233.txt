During shopping for Christmas, Frank and Molly run into each other. This fleeting short moment will start to change their lives, when they recognize each other months later in the train home and have a good time together. Although both are married and Frank has two little kids, they meet more and more often, their friendship becoming the most precious thing in their lives.
Molly, (Meryl Streep) is a beautiful housewife who is married to a doctor and lives in upstate NY. While out Christmas shopping she accidentally gets her packages mixed up in a Manhattan bookstore with a handsome young man named Frank (Rober De Niro). Frank is a married architect with two young children who also lives upstate. Months later they take the same train into NYC and bump into each other again. There is an instant attraction between them but neither of them is looking for an affair. They keep bumping into each other and having longer conversations. They are both falling in love against their better judgments. Honest with each other about not looking for an extramarital affair, they cannot resist seeing each other, just to talk. Their emotions grow stronger and they cannot stop thinking about each other.
