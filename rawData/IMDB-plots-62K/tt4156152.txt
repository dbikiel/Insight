An existential comedy about a Spanish man trying to apostatize from the Catholic Church.
Things are not going too well for Gonzalo Montoya. At thirty he has no girlfriend (despite a mutual attraction between his cousin Pilar and himself), he is still a student and has become the despair of his mother. Yet, Gonza is an intelligent, well-bred (if not too well-dressed) and kindhearted young man. Among other things he gets on well with Mait√©, his downstairs neighbor and proves a wonderful tutor (not to say surrogate father) to her son Antonio. But in the eyes of the conservative society he lives in, he has a major defect, his propensity to think for himself. If he has failed his philosophy exam, it is precisely because he would not duplicate his professor's views. And now what idea has he got ? To apostatize, nothing less! Needless to say that his decision marks the beginning of a long, long...Way of the Cross!
