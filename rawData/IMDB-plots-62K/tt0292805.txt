Join "tour-guide" Dave Attell as he takes a look at nightlife in different cities around the country until sunrise.
In this late-night traveling show, "Tour guide" Dave Attell visits late night spots (including bars, strip clubs, and clubs) and talks to whoever he finds. There's no home base for the show, as Dave is shown in different locations throughout North America each week. The average "guest" to the show could be naked, cross dressing, or just completely drunk.
