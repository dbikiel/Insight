The spirit of an ancient evil queen posesses the body of a young anthropological student, who then goes on a murderous rampage.
A sexy anthropologist is on holiday, goes for a swim in the sea and when she gets back to dry land she has become 'Lady Terminator', possessed by the spirit of an ancient and evil South Seas Queen (who is invincible to gunfire), whom is just waiting to go on a murderous rampage. She is soon armed with an AK-47 and isn't afraid to use it as she now takes to the streets of Indonesia to get revenge on those who have wronged her and get a bit of erm, male company that she hasn't had the pleasure of for rather a long time. Sit back and enjoy this Indonesian cheesy horror with more than the occasional nod to 'The Terminator'.
