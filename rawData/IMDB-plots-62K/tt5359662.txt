The first Brazilian on death row.
In July of 2012, ten years after being on the death row in Indonesia for drug trafficking, Marco Archer "Curumim", invited the director, Marcos Prado, to make a film about his life. Curumim did not want to be remembered only as the first Brazilian to be executed by a firing squad, he had an important story to tell. They've worked together over three years; there were more than seventy hours of recorded phone calls and dozens of letters describing the paths that led him there. By his own will and risk, "Curumim" managed to hide a camera inside his room at a maximum-security prison and recorded around three hours of footage of his daily life. "Curumim" offers an intimate journey through the life of a bold, charismatic and irreverent man who regretted his own choices and needed who wants desperately to perpetuate its existence.
The life of Marco "Curumim" Archer changes dramatically when 13.5 kg of cocaine hidden in his hang glider was discovered by police from the international airport of Jakarta, Indonesia. After hiding for 16 days by the idyllic islands of Indonesia, Marco was arrested and sentenced to death. Eleven years later, he became the first Brazilian to be executed for drug dealing in the world.
