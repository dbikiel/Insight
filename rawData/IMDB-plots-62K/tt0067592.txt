A group of tourists traveling on a bus take a detour to stay overnight in a castle owned by a family cursed with a history of Satanism and death.
In the 12th century, Sigfried von Rhoneberg signed a pact with the Devil. Along with Rhoneberg's soul, Satan demanded that the eldest daughter of each generation serve him as a succubus. For this reason, the current Baron von Rhoneberg [Jean Servais] killed his firstborn daughter in hopes of stopping the curse. Unknown by the baron, however, his dead brother Rudolph also fathered a daughter with the maid.A tourbus of six [each representing a Deadly Sin]-- seminarian Albin Corvelle [Lorenzo Terson?], rich Mr [?] and Mrs [Colette Emmanuelle] Foster, cynical old Mr Mason [Lucien Raimbourg?], and two pretty girls, Regine [Shirley Corrigan] and Corinne [Ivana Novak] -- plus the ever-hungry tourguide Matt Ducard [Christian Maillet?] are forced to take refuge at the Rhoneberg castle after the road is blocked and a storm threatens. The are joined shortly after arrival by the maid's beautiful and lascivious daughter, Lisa Muller [Erika Blanc]. During the long night, Lisa leads all the tourists one by one to their deaths. Gluttony Matt Ducard chokes on a glass of wine, greedy Mrs Foster falls into a quicksand of gold, Mr Foster (envy?) is guillotined, promiscuous Corinne is impaled in an iron maiden, a snake gets slothful Regine, and Lisa pushes cynical Mr Mason from a tower window to be impaled below on a wrought iron fence. Only the seminarian, Albin Sorelle, seems immune to Lisa's seductive charms. When all six tourists are dead, Satan [Daniel Emilfork] calls on Albin. In his prideful belief that he can outwit anyone in a game of chess, Albin makes a deal with Satan--he offers his soul if Satan will return the dead tourists to life. Satan agrees. The next morning, everyone wakes up as though nothing happened. Even Albin remembers it only as a dream.Unfortunately, the baron is wounded that morning in a fencing accident with Hans the butler [Jacques Monseau]. Albin chooses to remain at the castle while the tourists go on. As Albin and Lisa watch the tourbus heading back to the main road, the bus suddenly swerves to miss a funeral wagon (driven by Satan) and goes over a cliff, killing everyone aboard. Albin enfolds the luscious Lisa in his arms, and Satan smiles. [Original Synopsis by bj_kuehl.]
