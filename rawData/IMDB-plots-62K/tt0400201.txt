A young couple and their daughter move into an old house hanted by spirits.
When Signe and her workaholic husband Tommy visit a house for sale in Glamstrup, they immediately like it and a couple of days later they buy it. They move with their daughter Bianca and befriend their neighbors Marianne and her husband David that live on the other side of the street. While Tommy is working, Signe notes that weird things happen in the living room, with a black cat appearing, the fireplace firing alone and fruits getting rotten while Bianca plays and talks to her imaginary friend Oliver. Further, she discovers that the siblings Jane and Oliver died three years ago in a fire in another neighborhood in Glamstrup. She decides to call the medium Anders Svendsen to solve the mystery and he communicates with the spirits of the dead that are trapped in the spot and he tries to guide them to another world. When Marianne offers a job to Signe, she hires the teenager nanny Sarah that flirts with David. Meanwhile Tommy travels to Aalborg and meets the structural engineer that built the living room using material recovered from the fire where the siblings died. Further, he finds that on the next day is the three year anniversary of the tragedy. He decides to return to Glamstrup, but his car has a mechanical problem and she is stranded in Aalborg. Meanwhile Signe unravels a dark secret about the death of Jane and Oliver.
