The film is set in a post-apocalyptic world in which civilisation has crumbled. A massive electromagnetic pulse has killed all children on the planet with the exception of Molly (Billie Rutherford), the daughter of Jake Slater (Jake Ryan).
In a world governed by a bio-tech virus,
One man remains immune -
And the key to freeing the remaining population,
Is also the last child on Earth,
...his daughter.
