An edgy comedy about two frustrated plus-size women obsessed with their weight while struggling to find love and acceptance in a world full of "hot bodied" babes.
Superstar comedienne Mo'Nique is hilarious as a sassy, plus-sized fashion designer who's tired of taking no for an answer in this delightful comedy about living life to the fullest. Jazmin Biltmore (Mo'Nique) has big plans for large ladies - she's designed a sexy line of clothes for curvaceous women like herself. But when she can't get funding for her designs or meet a man who appreciates her unique physique, Jazmin's patience starts running thin. That is, until she wins an all-expense-paid trip to a resort in Palms Springs, where she just might just meet the man of her dreams.
