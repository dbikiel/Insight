Broke and alone on New Year's Eve, Wilson just wants to spend the rest of a very bad year in bed. But, when his best friend convinces him to post a personal ad, he meets a woman bent on finding the right guy to be with at midnight.
On New Year's Eve, Wilson, a twenty-nine-year old guy has just had the worst year of his life. He emigrated to Los Angeles, has no date, no concrete plans and every intention of locking the doors and forgetting the last year ever happened. That is until his best friend, Jacob, browbeats him into posting a personal ad on Craig's List. When Vivian, a strong-willed woman hell bent on being with the right guy at the stroke of midnight responds, a chaotic, sometimes hilarious, sometimes touching journey through the black and white streets of L.A. begins. In the waning hours of the year, emotional vulnerability and bitterly honest humor seem to be waiting around every corner.
On New Year's Eve, author Texan Wilson (29), still broke and lonely in L.A. after three years since Karen dumped him, follows the advice of his lifelong Texan buddy Jacob, who is about to propose to Min, to try dating the modern way, by social network site. Wilson gets chosen by would be-actress Vivian, a blatantly abusive feminist who promises him no intimacy at all, just a seasonal midnight kiss. They grow closer as they learn about each-other's lives, including her violently vindictive ex Jack.
The film follows the plight of Wilson (Scoot McNairy), a 29-year-old man who has just suffered through the most miserable year of his life. A new arrival to the City of Angels, Wilson ends up alone and penniless as New Year's Eve rapidly approaches, and avows to lock his doors, pull his blinds, and climb into bed - until best friend Jacob (Brian McGuire) talks him into posting a Craigslist personal ad. In seemingly no time at all, the message leads Wilson to Vivian (Sara Simmonds), a young woman who is determined to be with the "right" man at the stroke of midnight.
