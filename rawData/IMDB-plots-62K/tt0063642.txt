A musical biography of Gertrude Lawrence, who led a hustling and bustling life on the stage.
Film based on life of actress Gertrude Lawrence, on- and offstage, takes the opportunity to feature extravagant musical production numbers with 'Julie Andrews' , acting, singing and dancing.
Semi-fictional account of the life of British actress/singer Gertrude Lawrence. It's 1940 and approximately two decades into Gertrude's so far highly successful stage career. Gertrude is watching a just completed newsreel of her life compiled by Jerry Paul, who has asked for her critique and input, which leads to her reminiscing about her life. It tells of Gertrude's humble beginnings in Clapham, and her early career working with her vaudeville performing father. At that time, she did whatever was required to stand out from the crowd. She worked in the chorus of stage revues for impresario André Charlot, with who she had a love/hate professional relationship. An opportunity eventually led to starring roles, fame in Britain and ultimately in the United States on Broadway. But the want always to be "on" and to have all the world be her stage led to issues in her personal life, including some financial difficulties, and being a largely absent mother to her only offspring, daughter Pamela. She had relationships with several men over her life including stage manager Jack Roper, nobleman Sir Anthony Spencer, actor Charles Fraser, financier Ben Mitchell, and banker Richard Aldrich, only one of who probably understood and thus could handle her temperamental nature. Arguably the most important symbiotic relationship she had was with writer/actor Noël Coward, a lifelong friend and the person who would ultimately create many of her professional opportunities.
