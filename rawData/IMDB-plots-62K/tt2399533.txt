Several elderly homosexual men and women speak frankly about their pioneering lives, their fearless decision to live openly in France at a time when society rejected them.
"Les Invisibles" (The Invisible) of the title are a group men and women born between the two world wars. They have nothing in common except they are all gay and that they decided to be open about their homosexuality at a time when society rejected them. Despite general disapproval, they refused to deny who they actually were, thus maintaining their integrity. Today they talk before SÃ©bastien Lifshitz's camera. Without hate. Without bitterness. With cheerful dignity.
