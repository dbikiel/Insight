Five Indians living in London find themselves thrown together when two of them are implicated for a bomb blast. An Indian lawyer enters the scene to bail them out of their predicament.
Christmas Eve, London. While the snow-clad city gets ready to celebrate the festival of peace and joy, a series of bizarre incidents shatter the Christmas calm. A couple of luckless Indians find themselves hauled by the London police and made scapegoats. Or are they? Chocolate unfolds a web of sinister plots, slowly unearthing true and mystifying personalities of seven individuals - seven high-strung, distinctive people who have chosen to remain in the foreign land hoping to make or break their lives.
Following the September 11, 2001 attacks in the U.S.A., an explosion in a motor boat shatters the peaceful silence on Christmas eve in London, Britain. Following this incident is a daring robbery from an armored vehicle carrying billions of pounds. The police suspect two East Indians - Pipi and Simran Chopra. They are interrogated extensively amidst allegations that they may be linked to Al Qaeda. Then a Crime Journalist, Monsoon Iyer, comes to know about their plight, meets them, and asks her boyfriend, Advocate Krishan Pundit, to represent them. Krishan meets with the two, listens to their side of the incidents, is convinced of their innocence, and quite sure that the above two incidents as well as the deaths of three of Pipi and Simran's friends were the actions of a notorious terrorist named Murtaza Arafi. But is their version the truth of what actually happened? If Krishan continues to defend them will he also be made a scapegoat by the British authorities? As well be on the hit-list of Murtuza?
