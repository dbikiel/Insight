On New Year's Eve, the driver of a ghostly carriage forces a drunken man to reflect on his selfish, wasted life.
It's New Year's Eve. Three drunkards evoke a legend. The legend tells that the last person to die in a year, if he is a great sinner, will have to drive during the whole year the Phantom Chariot, the one that picks up the souls of the dead... David Holm, one of the three drunkards, dies at the last stroke of midnight...
The story is based on an old Swedish folk tale that states the last man to die just before the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve is doomed to drive the Phantom Carriage for the following year collecting all of the spirits of the dead. When David Holm proves to be that man, he learns of the selfish life he has led and how it has impacted on people around him.
At New Year's Eve, the tuberculous sister of the Salvation Army, Edit, asks her mother and her colleague, Maria, to call David Holm to visit her on her deathbed. Meanwhile, David (an alcoholic) is recounting the Legend of 'The Phantom Coach and his coachmen' to two other drunkards in the cemetery. In accordance with the legend, the last sinner to die on the turn of the New Year becomes the soul collector, gathering souls in his coach. When David refuses to visit Edit, his friends have an argument with him, they fight and David dies. When the coachman arrives, he recognizes his friend Georges, who died at the end of the last year. George revisits parts of David's obnoxious life and in flashbacks, he shows how mean and selfish David was.
