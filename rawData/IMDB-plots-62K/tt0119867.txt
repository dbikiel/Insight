The incredible story of the events leading up to the bombing of the World Trade Center in New York and the capture of the terrorists. The amazing thing is that the FBI had an informant among the terrorists, but refused to pay him $500/wk for more information. They eventually had to pay $1 million and place him in the witness protection program. A story of incompetence on all sides.
