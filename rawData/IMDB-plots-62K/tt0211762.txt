A naughty boy named Nils is shrunken to a small size after offending a tomte. He has to go on a voyage with geese across Lapland to fulfill the prophecy and turn back to normal.
The film tells about the disobedient boy Niels, who was bewitched by a dwarf. Having become very small in stature and having the opportunity to understand animals, the boy sets off on a dangerous journey with the domestic goose Martin. On the road, they unexpectedly meet a gnome who tells the boy that in order to remove the spell, you must fulfill three conditions that Niels subsequently fulfills and safely returns home.
