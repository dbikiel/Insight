Long-time friends: Davide, a successful novelist, lives with Lorenzo, who's everyone's favorite; Antonio and Angelique, married with two children; Neval, a voluble Turk, and her compliant husband; Sergio, an aging gay man; and, Roberta, beautiful, heavily into drugs. They have secrets: an affair, a business venture. Then, tragedy strikes, and the group pulls together for one of their own, who may not want their intersession. Are there limits to the power of friendship?
This film focuses on contemporary 30- and 40-somethings trying to make sense of their lives in an age in which the old certainties have disappeared. Lorenzo (Luca Argentero) and Davide (Pierfrancesco Favino) make their lives together within a circle that includes Antonio (Stefano Acorsi) and Angelica (Margherita Buy), married with children; Nerval (Serra Yilmaz) and her policeman husband (Filippo Timi); and Davides ex, Sergio (Ennio Fantastachini). When tragedy strikes, the boundaries and divisions among friends, acquaintances and even lovers become brutally apparent.
