Dysfunctional friends Dignan and Anthony plan and execute a robbery with their pot-growing friend, Bob.
The banality of crime. Two young men, Dignan and Anthony, walk along talking about "Starsky and Hutch." They're on their way to burglarize a house. After, they go to a caf√©, play some pinball. They argue about the burglary and talk to their friend Bob about another scheme. They talk to a guy about buying a gun, just to intimidate. Anthony breaks into a car to steal a wallet. With Bob, they plan and stage a holdup and talk about it afterward at a burger stand: armed robbery for $183. They're pleased. The two pals race each other.
