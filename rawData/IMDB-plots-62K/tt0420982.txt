This movie is about the stern gangster customs of one of the Russian provincial cities in the mid-90s . And you could expect either a stupid game of blind man's buffets or a truly bloody showdown with the stacks of "bluffers".
Blindfolds - an old Russian game: leading, blindfolded, catches the rest of the players. Nizhny Novgorod. Two small bandits Serega and Simon worked for a big criminal Sergei Mikhailovich. But this time they failed the mission: he ordered to bring a chemist who claimed that he made a new portion of white powder, and Serega and Simon staged a real carnage in the laboratory, leaving there dead bodies - a chemist and a couple of his guards. Sergei Mikhailovich was very angry, but limited himself to oral suggestion, after which he gave the guys another assignment: to go to the law firm and exchange a suitcase with money for a suitcase with heroin. But even here Serega and Simon were unlucky: the exchange took place, only at the exit from the office they were met by Koron, Bala and Eggplant - three bandits hired by the senior police lieutenant Stepan, a "werewolf in uniform", dreaming to throw Sergei Mikhailovich on big dough.
Sergei and Simon have to deliver a suitcase full of heroin to Mikhalych or else they will be killed. There is one minor detail: the only problem-solving technique they are familiar with is a shot in the head. There are more than 20 Russian-movie stars in the film, but you will not be able to recognize them immediately since they are all in disguise.
