A 17th century Hungarian countess embarks on a murderous undertaking, with the belief that bathing in the blood of virgins will preserve her beauty.
The Hungarian Countess Elizabeth Bathory, wife of General Ferencz Nasady. They lived in the Carpathian mountains in the early 1600's. Elizabeth was convinced that drinking and bathing in the blood of young virgins would preserve her beauty. Her small army of henchmen roamed the countryside, kidnapping unfortunate girls who were then killed and drained of their blood in Elizbeth's castle. Convicted in 1611 of murdering at least 50 girls, Bathory was sealed in a room, fed through a hole in the door and lasted 4 years before dying.
