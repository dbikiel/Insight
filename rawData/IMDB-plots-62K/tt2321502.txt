A technology reporter gets a week of exclusive access to the world's first perfect artificial intelligence. When the reporter begins a relationship with the scientist who created it, the A.I. begins to exhibit startling and unnerving emergent behavior.
Tech reporter Joy Andrews gets exclusive week-long access to write an article on a brilliant reclusive roboticist David Kressen and his creation, Adam - the world's first perfect artificial intelligence. As she spends time with them, she finds herself drawn to David's intellect and charisma, while perceiving a shift in Adam's attitude to her that may be menacing. As the connection between Joy and David deepens, Adam begins to exhibit startling emergent behavior that may or may not be a threat to them all.
