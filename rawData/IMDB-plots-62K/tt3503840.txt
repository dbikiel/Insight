When a contract killer (Steven Seagal) encounters a girl on the run from a mob boss (Vinnie Jones) with powerful political ties, he is torn between protecting the girl, and remaining loyal to the government agency that hired him for the mission.
An Operative is recruited by his old boss to take out an Afghan drug dealer named Kamaal. His old boss is concerned that he may try to sell information on the fact that profits from heroin in the world are being split between the powerful families in Afghanistan and the most powerful and secret groups in the US. The operative meets two victims of human trafficking and is convinced that Kamaal and the sex trafficking is somehow linked.
