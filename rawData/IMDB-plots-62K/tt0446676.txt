As an ex-gambler teaches a hot-shot college kid some things about playing cards, he finds himself pulled into the world series of poker, where his protégé is his toughest competition.
Law school graduate Alex Stillman isn't happy as junior clerk in his domineering father's firm but finds distraction as highly gifted Internet poker player. Legendary Tommy Vinson, who retired 20 years ago for his wife's sake, successfully offers to coach Alex for half of the fortunate he can learn to win in Las Vegas. The training, focusing on bluffing and dirty tricks, goes well until Alex feels abused by a girl hired by Vinson. They end up both entering the world tour grand final.
