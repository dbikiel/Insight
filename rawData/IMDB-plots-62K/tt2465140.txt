When five struggling single moms put aside their differences to form a support group, they find inspiration and laughter in their new sisterhood, and help each other overcome the obstacles that stand in their way.
The Single Moms Club follows five single mothers from different walks of life who come together when their teen kids, who all attend the same exclusive school, get in trouble for smoking and vandalism. It turns out that the school makes parents get involved when their children act out, so the five women are tasked with organizing a fundraiser dance. The group consists of Jan (Wendi McLendon-Covey), a type-A executive who is struggling to hold on to her stressful career in publishing; Hillary (Amy Smart), a mother of three still reeling from her recent divorce, and who has the hots for her new neighbor; Esperanza (Zulay Henao), who is hiding her new boyfriend from her ex-husband because she fears he might take away his financial support; May (Nia Long), an aspiring writer with a drug-addict ex-husband and a teenage son who wants to know more about his dad; and Lytia (Cocoa Brown), a sassy waitress trying to keep her youngest son from falling into a life of crime. The outspoken Jan and the equally unfiltered Lytia quickly butt heads, but as the five start to open up about their parenting and dating struggles, they find they can lean on each other for support..
