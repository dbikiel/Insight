US art dealer returns to his native Germany for a visit and is attracted by Nazi propaganda.
Martin Schulz (Paul Lukas), a German/American art dealer, returns to Germany at the outbreak of World War Two, adopts the Nazi propaganda philosophy, refuses to protect the Jewish fiancee, Griselle Eisenstein (K.T. Stevens), of his son Heinrich Schulz (Peter Van Eyck), who has stayed in America to run the family business - and ultimately falls victim to the Gestapo himself.
