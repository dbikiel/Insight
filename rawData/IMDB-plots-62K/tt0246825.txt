A carefully constructed nonsense about a teenage boy named Om in a small Indian village.
Om makes a living by holding his breath. He becomes a star attraction during the Pushkar fair by giving darshan to the masses at A fixed time, emerging from the water. A mass movement starts in his name. At a fixed time everybody is going to hold his or her breath as a protest against the Brahmas big breath. But Oms non-cooperation is to breathe and if he breathes in the water, he dies. Its the murder plan by the water proof watch company.
