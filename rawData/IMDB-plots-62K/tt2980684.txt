Jerusalem, 1966. In a crumbling old building in the center of the city, lives a small family. Eli, the father, is at work all day. His wife Ruthy is locked up inside her own world and spends her days in bed, reading the thick novels her husband brings her from the library. Michal, their 11-year-old daughter, is lonely and bored and seeks attention from the other tenants and attractions around the building. One day, when Ruthy decides to get out of bed, the apparent peace and serenity of the house is violated.
