A butler working in a foreign embassy in London falls under suspicion when his wife accidentally falls to her death, the only witness being an impressionable young boy.
Philippe, a diplomat's son and good friend of Baines the butler, is confused by the complexities and evasions of adult life. He tries to keep secrets but ends up telling them. He lies to protect his friends, even though he knows he should tell the truth. He resolves not to listen to adults' stories any more when Baines is suspected of murdering his wife and no-one will listen to Philippe's vital information.
Baines, an English butler working at a French embassy, is more of a father to the ambassador's young son, Phillipe, than the ambassador. But the hated Mrs. Baines, the head housekeeper, is not a mother to him. Phillipe discovers Baines is having an affair with a young French woman working as a secretary in the embassy. But he's too young to realise what he knows. He believes Baines's story - the young woman is his niece, and he agrees to keep the matter a secret. Secrets and lies become the dominant themes of his young life -- especially when he thinks he's witnessed a murder.
