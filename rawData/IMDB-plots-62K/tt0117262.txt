Orson Welles' archives of unfinished/never released movies and the last years of his life from the perspective of Oja Kodar (life and artistic partner Of Orson Welles in his last years). She discovers with the viewer many of the projects that Orson never completed or short movies that he never released : The Magic Show, Swinging London (and its segment the one man band that gives its title to the documentary), Vienna, The Merchant of Venice, Moby Dick, The Deep, The other Side of the Wind, The Dreamers. Oja returns to Orson's abandoned house in Orvilliers (France) where she discovers more of his writings during the preparation of the Moby Dick project. Despite the destruction of squatters, Orson's work still remains after all these years; despite the discouragement of Hollywood producers and of financial problems, the talent of Welles still remains clearly visible in this unfinished movies.
