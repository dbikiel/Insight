Germany's Adolf Hitler, with his Axis-stooges, Italy's Mussolini and Japan's Suki Yama, although he tried to avoid taking them, is on his way, via submarine, to a tropical country to negotiate a treaty with the High Chief Paj Mab. However, an American P.T-boat crew is already there and have some plans for schickenbit-grubber and his buddies.
In this Hal Roach "Streamliner", Adolf Hitler decides to conclude a treaty with the tropical potentate the Paj Mab of Norom. However Hitler desperately wants to keep it a secret from his two millstones-- er - allies, Benito Mussolini and General Suki Yaki. To no avail, as they discover his plans anyway and impose themselves upon his mission. Meanwhile, in beautiful tropical Norom, the crew of the Susie Q, a merchantman sunk by a Nazi U-Boot, touches down on land. Among them is the resourceful and clever Seaman Benson. Benson, while exploring the island paradise, runs across Bobo the Great, a travelling magician, and his pretty assistant. Bobo, completely blackout drunk, was to have made a command performance before the Paj Mab and his guest, Mr. Hitler. If Bobo did well, he'd get a cash reward and a big fat pig (not Hitler, another pig. No, not Mussolini either). If he failed to show up, he'd be a head shorter. Benson makes the best of the situation, taking on Bobo's identity so that he can give Schiklgrueber a few good swift kicks right in the Axis. Much hilarity ensues as "The Last Three" end up roundly and cathartically abused by Benson's mischief.
