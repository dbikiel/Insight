Sailor Danny Xavier Smith and two other gobs try to save his sister Susan's virtue. She wants to get a role in the show "Hit the Deck". After wrecking the producers hotel suite, they land in the brig. But Danny's father is a Rear Admiral...
Navy men William Clark, Rico Ferrari and Danny Smith have struck up a friendship based on their misadventures despite Bill being a chief petty officer and the other two merely seamen. They are on a 48 hour liberty in San Francisco. Each is looking forward to the liberty, but each encounters problems there. Bill has been pre-engaged to a showgirl named Ginger for six years, she who he truly loves. She believes his continual enlistment is an excuse not to marry her. As such, she dumps him for - gasp - a civilian. Rico's mother wants to get remarried, but Rico's appearance may thwart her plans. And Danny hasn't told his friends that his father is a navy rear admiral as he doesn't want to appear to get any special treatment. His professional destiny is to go to Annapolis like his father did and as his father did. But Danny's bigger problem is his innocent sister Susan, who wants to take up with showman Wendell Craig, who, starring in a navy themed show called "Hit the Deck", promises her a part. Danny, based on comments by one of Wendell's featured performers Carol Pace, is afraid that Wendell's audition process is more of a casting couch. The three friends vow to help the others over their crises, but their misadventures continue - especially in their attempt to protect Susan - which could cause problems with the naval shore patrol, which in turn could be an issue with Rear Admiral Smith. Along the way, some possible romances ensue - between Rico and Susan, and between Danny and Carol - if only their misunderstandings wouldn't get in the way.
