Jane Osgood runs a lobster business, which supports her two young children. Railroad staff inattention ruins her shipment, so with her lawyer George, Jane sues Harry Foster Malone, director of the line and the "meanest man in the world".
Jane Osgood is trying to support her two young children by running a lobster business. After one of her shipments is ruined by inattention at the railroad station, Jane decides to take on Harry Foster Malone, director of the line and the "meanest man in the world". With the help of her lifelong friend - and lawyer - George Denham, Jane sues Malone for the price of her lobsters &amp; her lost business. What she ends up with is a lot more than either of them bargained for.
Living in Cape Anne, Maine, widowed Jane Osgood is trying to support her family of two young children by starting a lobster mail order business. Things for her business start off badly when a shipment perishes due to the operation of the Eastern &amp; Portland Railroad, newly acquired by penny-pinching Harry Foster Malone. When the E&amp;P fails to compensate Jane adequately for their error, Jane gets into a David versus Goliath battle with the powerful Malone, who she deems the meanest man in the world. The story affects all the townsfolk and reaches a national audience, Jane having both supporters and detractors. But both Jane and Malone will do whatever they can to beat the other, both who see the fight as a matter of principle. Meanwhile, New York based reporter Larry Hall, in Cape Anne to cover the story, falls for Jane. This move does not sit well with George Denham, who is Jane's childhood friend, lawyer and wannabe suitor.
