Norman, the small green parakeet of a former table tennis champ who failed to bring home the gold medal, is showing early signs of bird narcolepsy.
Saving Norman tells the story of a hypochondriac ex-ping pong player who missed the biggest tournament of his career because of a cold. Now years later he lives a hermetic existence with his parrot Norman. But, when Norman seems to be suffering from a case of bird narcolepsy he calls in pet psychic Belinda who soon realizes that in order to help Norman, she'll first have to help his owner.
In denial, and self-exiled within the confined space of his small apartment, Lionel Pembrooke, the once-promising table tennis champ and USA's hopeful frontrunner, has allowed himself to turn into a pill-popping recluse, when back then in late eighties South Korea, a nasty cold robbed him of his chance to bring home the gold medal. And now, to make matters worse, Norman, his parakeet, is showing early signs of bird narcolepsy. As Belinda, a pet psychic and animal behaviourist, attempts to help, an unanswered question arises: would things be different if Lionel was able to compete?
