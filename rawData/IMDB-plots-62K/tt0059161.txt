Alien "eye" creatures invade a small town.
Eye Creatures land on earth. The U.S. Air Force spies on some teens making out in the woods, then tries to prevent word of the Eye Creatures landing from leaking out. A couple of teens figure everything out and prevent the Eye Creatures from taking over by shining their headlights on them...
A saucer landing is expected (and highly classified) by top people in military. The local army base is instructed to keep watch for activity in the sky, but instead they use an infrared scope to watch local teens make out. The saucer lands. Meanwhile, the two main characters are trying to elope. Keeping headlights off to avoid attention, they run over an eye creature. They report this, but in the meantime the eye creatures have possessed the body of a young drifter and so the two are arrested. The army finds the saucer, cordons it off and blows it up. The teens escape from the police station and discover that the eye creatures explode when exposed to bright light...
