A homosexual woman marries a gay male friend to prevent his deportation, but they soon fall in love.
Episodic look at an unlikely couple trying to make it in L.A. during the late 1970s. He's Albert, an illegal alien from Belgium, serving as chauffeur and lover to a string of powerful men. She's Stella, a real estate agent with several women lovers. When he's out of a job, she temporarily takes him in. He becomes her cook and housekeeper, time passes, and they marry so he won't be deported. Later, after a boozy birthday celebration with him, she finds herself pregnant. They try to be a family, love grows, and she puts her career on hold as his career, as a fashion designer, takes off. Can this gay couple stay true to each other, and what happens when their hormones call?
