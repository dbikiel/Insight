A London publisher recounts a lunchtime reunion with a former lover, in poetic monologue.
An existential parable of a wistful journey to ones heady youth with the excitement and bitterness of that time trapped in the mind. A former romance is re-evaluated by the rose coloured filter of time but confronted by the present. Time has moved on but the past has trapped the author.
