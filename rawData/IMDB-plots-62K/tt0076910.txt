The lives and romantic entanglements of a group of young adults who have achieved "overnight" success in Los Angeles.
This mosaic comedy-drama tells the story of a La Ronde-like circle of romantic adventures and failed affairs centered around a songwriter named Carroll Barber and his father Carl Barber. There is a trail of Carroll's past relationship spread throughout the city of Los Angeles. Barber is an aloof womanizer who cannot commit to any relationship, and is used to illustrate the loneliness of Los Angeles big-city life. Among the women in his life are Ann Goode, a lonely real estate agent, Karen Hood, a Valley housewife addicted to taxi rides, Linda Murray, a woman prone to vacuuming in the nude and Nona Bruce, the snapshot-taking mistress of a wealthy man.
