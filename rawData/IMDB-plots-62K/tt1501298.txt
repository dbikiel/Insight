A young post-graduate faces difficulties with finding employment, and struggles against social inequalities.
Embedded with intense emotion and fierce action, this haunting social saga delves into the sensitive subject of bias against Tamil in Tamil Nadu, due to rampant westernisation and materialistic lifestyles in modern Tamil society. The stigma and double standards faced by those educated in Tamil-medium schools is explicitly highlighted through the tragic events in the life of Prabhakar (Jiiva), an orphan who is brought up by a Tamil teacher and subsequently becomes passionate about the Tamil language and goes on to become masters graduate in Tamil. This heart-wrenching tale plots Prabhakar's struggles throughout life, his tragic love affair with Anandhi (Anjali) and the terrible sequence of events that gradually causes him to deteriorate into a psychopathic serial killer, who later confesses to killing 22 people in cold blood. What horrific events could have turned a gentle and passionate young boy into a mass murderer?
