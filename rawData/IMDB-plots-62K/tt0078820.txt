Rock artist Frank Zappa hosts a concert in New York City. This movie contains tons of on-stage footage, off-stage footage, and animation.
A tradition of Zappa was giving a special gig on Halloween. In 1977, the event took place in New York with one of his best bands: there was Terry Bozzio, Peter Wolf and a young Adrian Belew. Baby snakes reproduces most of the concert Zappa the guitar player can be best appreciated here than anywhere, apart from bizarre backstage interviews, including one with animator Bruce Bickford explaining some of his creations. The film opened at one single New York theater in 1979, and it was so successful that stayed on for months.
