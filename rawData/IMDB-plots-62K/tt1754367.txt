Juan and his urban family live in the Mexican countryside, where they enjoy and suffer a world apart. And nobody knows if these two worlds are complementary or if they strive to eliminate one another.
Juan, a wealthy householder and Natalia are an artistic middle-class couple. They decide to change the life of the city. And they move to countryside with their two young children Eleazar and Rut for a plain and simple country life. Starting again with an ostentatious house (in comparison to the homes of the few neighbors), they initially enjoy the taste of rural life. However this change in taste begins to make the marriage crumble. The children, on the other hand, are not encumbered by previous ideas and enjoy the life offered by this bleak place. Juan begins to have contact with people who have the same ideals. Seven, a man who usually does everything in his power to survive leads him to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in a ramshackle cabin in the woods. At one stage, the couple jet off for an up-scale sex holiday in Europe, where the rooms in the bath-house are named after Hegel and Duchamp.
