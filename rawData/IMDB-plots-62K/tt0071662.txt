A young man is temporarily home from a Seminary, but eventually falls in love with his father's young new wife.
A young seminarian is back to his family to reflect on the sincerity of his mystical vocation. Here, in a pleasant Sicilian province, he has to face several sexual temptations, even encouraged by his grandfather Don Salvatore, who suffers from satyriasis. When the grandfather dies, Carmela, his young stepmother, will definitively discourage the seminarian from his religious intentions.
