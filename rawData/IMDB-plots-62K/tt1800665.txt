The acclaimed musician's rigorous touring year culminates in perpetual fever as he crosses the finish line on crutches from an onstage injury. Concert documentary features collaborators Martin Dosh, Annie Clark of St. Vincent, and others.
Filmed during culminating months of the acclaimed singer-songwriter's most rigorous year of touring, Andrew Bird crosses the December finish line in his hometown of Chicago - feverish and on crutches from an onstage injury. Is he suffering hazards of chasing the ghost of inspiration? Or merely transforming into a different kind of animal "perfectly adapted to the music hall?" FEVER YEAR is the first to capture Bird's precarious multi-instrumental looping technique and features live performances at Milwaukee's Pabst Theater with collaborators Martin Dosh, Jeremy Ylvisaker, Michael Lewis and Annie Clark of St. Vincent.
