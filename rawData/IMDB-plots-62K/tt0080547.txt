Jan has his own night radio program where people can simply call and talk about own troubles. The station management does not share his compassion for lonely souls and think the program is useless. Jan has a wife with a drinking problem and a girlfriend on the side who deos not understand him either. He becomes more and more irritated and eventually loses control of himself and ends up in a mental clinic.
