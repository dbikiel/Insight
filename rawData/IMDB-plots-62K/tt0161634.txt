A duo of guys capture and brutally torture a young girl to the point of piercing her retina.
A group of guys capture a young girl with the intent of hurting her. They torture her in many ways, from beating her to putting a sharp piece of needle-like metal through her eye which pierces across her retina.
To explore the unknown boundaries of suffering and to push the threshold of pain further still, three pitiless explorers of anguish abduct a helpless young woman. Intent on putting their youthful subject through the seemingly endless ordeal of their sadistic research, the men use increasingly brutal techniques to test the theoretical limits of human endurance. Then, the torturers continue the investigation with a heavy hammer, paving the way for the infernal pièce de résistance: a fine and shiny surgical needle. Has anyone survived the Devil's experiment?
