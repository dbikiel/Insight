A Hollywood filmmaker (Mike Jittlov) makes a short for an evil film studio. Unbeknownest to him, the producer has placed a bet of $25,000 that he won't come up with anything with a use. Luckily, our film creator gets the help of his friends.
Based on a short by the same name and inspired by the real life difficulties encoundered by the main character (who is also the writer, director, producer, and lead actor of the movie) The Wizard of Speed and Time is a satirical story about an aspiring special effects creator, Mike Jittlov (played by Mike Jittlov) who wants to work in Hollywood on the "Doctor Magic" show. While his talent is top notch, he is unable to find works since he's not a "name" effects person. When an open minded director named Lucky Striker (played by Steve Broadie) who works for a rival studio sees Jittlov's work, he brings it to the attention of his penny pinching producer Harvey Bookman (played by Richard Kaye) and the two make a bet on whether or not Jittlov can produce an effects sequence they can use on their upcoming TV special "Hollywood's Greatest Effects".
Problems arise when the duo learn that although Jittlov is extremely talented and creative, he is not a member of any of the numerous guilds that are required to create film for the studio. While Striker tries to help Jittlov and his cameraman friend Brian Lucas (no relation), Bookman seeks to undermine them in order to win the bet goign so far as to hire thugs to kidnap Jittlov. In addition to the lack of funding Jittlov must overcome the numerous obstacles placed in the path of creativity in the Hollywood guild system in order to make his film for the studio. Stay for the credits.
