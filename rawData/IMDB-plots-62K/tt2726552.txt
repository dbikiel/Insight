In 1960s New York, Walter Stackhouse is a successful architect married to the beautiful Clara who leads a seemingly perfect life. But his fascination with an unsolved murder leads him into a spiral of chaos as he is forced to play cat-and-mouse with a clever killer and an overambitious detective, while at the same time lusting after another woman.
A psychological noir thriller set in 1960's New York based on Patricia Highsmith's novel, 'The Blunderer'. Walter Stackhouse is rich, successful and unhappily married to the beautiful but damaged Clara. His desire to be free of her feeds his obsession with Kimmel, a man suspected of brutally murdering his own wife. But when Clara is found dead in suspicious circumstances, Walter's string of lies and his own guilty thoughts seem enough to condemn him. As his life becomes dangerously entwined with Kimmel's, a ruthless cop is increasingly convinced he has found a copycat killer in Walter and aims to nail both murderers.
When Walter Stackhouse, an architect with a passion for writing, stumbles across an article about the unsolved murder case of Helen Kimmel, the gradual descent into a pit of lies, betrayal, and guilt awaits him. More and more--as the unhappily married Walter seeks inspiration for his crime novel--he finds himself entangled in a thorny mystery, without realising, however, that he alienates himself from Clara. Now, before a precarious situation, morbid thoughts start flooding Walter's confused mind, as Clara's untimely death intertwines the two deaths that share a small, but strange resemblance. But, as flimsy fabrications and inescapable contradictions multiply, who will be able to tell the difference between a liar and a murderer?
