Former political inmates Sergei and Nikolai live as exiles in a remote Siberian village. After the general Soviet gulag amnesty of 1953 8 pardoned common criminals terrorize the inhabitants.
In 1953, the year Stalin died, many prisoners (some political, but mostly common criminals) were released from the Soviet Gulags. This is the story of a remote settlement which was under attack by a bunch of these recently-released blood-thirsty thugs in the summer of 1953, and the townspeople, along with a two political prisoners, who try to stop them.
After Stalin's death in 1953, over 2 million people fell under amnesty. People were released from the camps, but not all of them were sent there on false charges. Among the political prisoners were ordinary criminals who also fell under amnesty. In a small village in the North, two political prisoners Sergey Basargin (Lusga) and Nikolay Skorobagatov (Kopalych) are quietly serving their term. Both have already served their time in the camp and dream of a quick amnesty promised by L. Beria. Measured quiet life of the main characters in a deaf village will be interrupted. Thanks to the amnesty, not only decent intelligent people who had stayed under a political article, but also hardened criminals, from whom the camps knocked out everything human, were released. It is this group of people who have come to this quiet village, they are arming themselves and begin to dictate their rules.
