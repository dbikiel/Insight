A feature length documentary work which presents a case for a needed transition out of the current socioeconomic monetary paradigm which governs the entire world society. This subject matter will transcend the issues of cultural relativism and traditional ideology and move to relate the core, empirical "life ground" attributes of human and social survival, extrapolating those immutable natural laws into a new sustainable social paradigm called a "Resource-Based Economy".
Zeitgeist: Moving Forward, by director Peter Joseph, is a feature length documentary work which presents a case for a transition out of the current socioeconomic paradigm, the "monetary system," to a new, sustainable social paradigm called a "Resource-Based Economy". Through a series of interviews, presentations of statistics, and historical analysis, Joseph builds an argument that economists should focus on the "life ground" attributes of human and social survival, extrapolating from those immutable natural laws a new socioeconomic system, rather than the "money sequence of value," which assigns value to monetary instruments independent of their relationship to natural laws.The documentary covers diverse issues ranging from human nature, nature vs nurture, genetics and epi-genetics, to social engineering, monetary policy, and macroeconomic policy on a global scale.Simultaneous with the documentary aspects of the film is a fictional narrative which attempts to dramatize the subjects being discussed, and which presents creative commentary on the current state of world affairs, and well as possible future scenarios.The film concludes with an illustration of a possible society based on the Resource- Based Economy, and a fictional narrative envisioning how such a system might emerge.
