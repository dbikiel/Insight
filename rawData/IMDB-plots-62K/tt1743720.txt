A documentary about branding, advertising and product placement that is financed and made possible by brands, advertising and product placement.
Ever notice your favorite soda brand in the background of the summer's hottest romantic comedy? Wonder why Carrie Bradshaw uses that specific kind of soap? In Morgan Spurlock's new documentary, the creator of "Super Size Me" shifts his focus from fast food excess to the power of product placement. He asks a simple question: backed by the right brands, could a documentary reach the same marketing success as Hollywood's latest blockbuster? Spurlock brings us along for the pitch, opening the conference room doors into the elusive world of marketing consumers are not supposed to see. This Sundance favorite challenges the absurd levels of product placement in our everyday lives, and Spurlock's biting humor makes it all the more entertaining.
