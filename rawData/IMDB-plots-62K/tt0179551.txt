Its the last Christmas together in Depression era Alabama of a sensitive boy and his elderly cousin who was his closest friend. The two raise enough money to buy the ingredients for 30 fruit cakes, sent mostly to strangers like FDR. They spend Christmas day flying the kites the made for each while Capote's voice over explains their separation, followed by their dog's passing, and a few years later her's.
As Christmastime approaches in rural Depression-era Alabama, a young boy and his best friend, an elderly woman distantly related to him, prepare for the impending holiday by gathering ingredients for their annual batch of fruitcakes for 'people who've struck our fancy'. On Christmas Eve, they talk with great anticipation of the next day, but underneath is the sad, almost unspoken knowledge that the boy is growing up and his cousin is getting older and more frail.
