A guy dies after collecting comic books for decades. His mom inherits them and she ain't selling. Owners of 2 comic book stores want the collection. Their scheming gets ever more desperate.
Told from the point of view from Archie, a comic book collector, this is the story of a rivalry between two comic book shop owners. One does it for the love of comics, while the other shop, run by a husband-and-wife team are in it strictly for the money. The situation brews to a head when a sneak collector, Conan discovers a large collection of perfectly-preserved classic comics, leading the two shops to vie to acquire them, along with a "villain" who hopes to steal them first.
