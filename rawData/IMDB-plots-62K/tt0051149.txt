After the American Civil War, former Union Major John Garth marries pretty settler Valerie but tragedy strikes and the two spouses end up in court where they give two different conflicting accounts of their marriage.
John Garth (Sterling Hayden) is tried for critically wounding his wife Valerie (Anita Ekberg) and murdering her parents (John Wengraf and Iphigenie Castiglioni.) His testimony is one of disappointment with Valerie, her unfaithfulness with Reverend Blake (Anthony Steele),and the continual nagging by her parents; a combination of events that drove him to violence. He makes no mention of having a bad childhood. Valerie, from her hospital bed, testifies of a nightmarish marriage, constant brutality and an unreasonable suspicion of Reverend Blake who befriended her in her misery.
