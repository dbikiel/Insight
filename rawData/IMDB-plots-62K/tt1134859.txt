Remy and Emile plead the case for rats by illustrating the historical and scientific facts about the species and their interaction with humans.
A forthright Remy and his reluctant brother Emile speak out for oppressed rats everywhere. Remy rolls film explaining that rats see themselves as on a par with men, who, instead, make war on rats. Remy gives a history lesson: heroism in India, black rat migration from the Middle East to Europe during the Crusades, the Black Death of 1347 to 1352, and Remy's contention that the flea was the villain. Enter the brown or Norway rat - from China. Both travel on ships around the world, with the larger brown pushing out the smaller black, and both live symbiotically with man. Then, Emile explains what's cool about rats. Trade phobia, Remy tells humans, for utopia. Any chance of that?
On behalf of all the oppressed rats everywhere, Remy, the black rat and Emile, the Norwegian brown rat from China, present the symbiotic relationship between humans and rats throughout history. From the Roman Empire to the Black Death and from the Hindu elephant-like deity Ganesha to Queen Victoria, the fates of both man and rodent are inextricably intertwined. Why can't we just get along?
