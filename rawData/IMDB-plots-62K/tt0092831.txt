The construction of a skyscraper is being haunted by a ghost.
When a window-washer falls to his death from the side of a Barcelona high-rise office building (also killing an unsuspecting pedestrian), security consultant Dennis Randall is called in to investigate. Although he first believes the deaths to be accidental, he soon comes to realize that some strange force is at work inside the building. What could be causing these accidents? More importantly, is there any way it can be stopped?
