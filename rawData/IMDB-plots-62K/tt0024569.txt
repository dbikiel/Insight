Sex seems to be on the minds of the animals on a backyard fence: the alley cats following a solitary female who may be in heat and the bull and the cows painted on an advertisement. After some singing by the cloven-hoofed crowd and music from a jazz band of cats, the focus is on one particular male cat and his tough-guy rival for the affections of the one female. After she watches them fight with each other and then confront a bull dog, she may have her own solution to the rivalry.
