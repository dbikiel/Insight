The saga of the First Group of Fighter Aviation of Brazil, which took part in the Second World War in the Italian skies, told by their own pilots. There are 23 interviews with veterans and their families, all of them illustrated by artist JÃºlio Zartos's drawings and mixed with images of that time, took by cameras hidden in Brazilian planes or borrowed from Aerospace Museum of Rio de Janeiro.
