Questions about the identity of an amnesiac (Matthew Montgomery) threaten his romance with the park ranger (Aaron Orr) who rescued him.
Drew (Aaron Orr) is a forest ranger who meets yuppie Mark (Matthew Montgomery) after he falls while rock climbing. Mark wakes up in the hospital with amnesia and sees that Drew has remained by his side since the accident. Drew barely holds his post as a ranger thanks to family ties, and his new love-interest, Mark, compels him to put this post into jeopardy. Drew offers to move in with Mark to help him out until he regains his memory, which propels the two men into a passionate affair. Drew struggles with the burden of both parents' deaths and his role in the remaining Parker family. As Mark's memory returns, he must make a choice between love in the prior life he is recalling and the current love he has nurtured and fostered between Drew. Mark must reconcile how he has transitioned his personality after amnesia with how he behaved and treated his lover before his loss of memory. It's complicated.
