Inga, a 17 year-old, is sent to live with a scheming aunt who wants her to become mistress of her rich neighbour. She falls for a common young man instead.
After her mother dies, seventeen year old Inga goes off to live with her attractive 30 something aunt Greta. Greta is sort of in a financial bind due to her young lover Karl, and his expensive ways. Greta schemes to sell of Inga's affections to a wealthy old man who likes 'em young but the entire plan fails when Inga hops in the sack with Karl and the two run off together. This leaves Greta broke, guy less and unhappy to say the least...
In her early thirties, the financially hard-pressed, Aunt Greta, has a clever plan to keep her and her high-priced boy-toy, Karl, afloat. Now that her beautiful and orphaned sixteen-year-old niece, Inga, lives with her, there is no better way to make a fast buck than to set her up with the sad and affluent loner, Einar, to pay off her debts. However, what if Karl, too, decides to take an interest in young and fresh, Inga?
