Memory is the glue that binds our mental lives. But how does it work? Neuroscientists using cutting-edge techniques are exploring the precise molecular mechanisms of memory. By studying a range of individuals ranging-from an 11-year-old whiz-kid, Jake Hausler, who remembers every detail of his life to a woman who had memories implanted-scientists have uncovered a provocative idea.
Memory is the key to our identity. Its the glue that binds our mental lives. Without it, wed be prisoners of the present, unable to use the lessons of the past to change our future. From our first kiss to where we put our keys, memory represents who we are, how we learn and how we navigate the world. But how does it actually work? In MEMORY HACKERS, NOVA explores the cutting edge frontiers of cognitive Science and molecular biology, where neuroscientists are probing our brains to unlock the secrets of human memory. The one-hour documentary, examines how memories are formed, what encompasses the act of remembering and the new technologies being used to implant, edit and even erase memoriesa process that could DELETE our worst fears and, one day, may help us to re-write our past with the flip of a switch.
