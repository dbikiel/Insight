A road movie where two brothers search for their biological parents.
Sibling rivalry in spades. Against his better judgment, Jason and Shelly, his girlfriend of three years, drive across Colorado for Christmas with his dad and brothers. A fight soon erupts between Jason and his competitive, critical, and constantly-talking brother Todd. After Todd drops a bomb about Jason's parents, Jason drives off with Shelly toward Austin, Texas, to get to the bottom of things. Jason and Shelly object but Todd insinuates himself into the mix, and soon the brothers are competing in foolish games while Jason ignores Shelly. She bails, leaving the boys to sort things out with each other and with Overbrook, the place that might have the answers.
