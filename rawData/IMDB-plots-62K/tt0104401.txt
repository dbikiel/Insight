On a rainy day as Uncle Heathcliff is forced to babysit his nephews, and spends the time recounting his adventures, he meets a cat who looks just like him, one where he winds up working for a mob boss, one where his dad gets released from prison but he thinks he escaped, one where he actually tries to be good, and a few others. In one tale, Heathcliff's pop gets parole, although Heathcliff thinks he's escaped; in another, Heathcliff's "good angel" conscience makes a short-lived appeal to his saintly side. Nostalgia reigns as the tabby holy terror plays various roles of television star, wrestling champ, and neighborhood bully.
