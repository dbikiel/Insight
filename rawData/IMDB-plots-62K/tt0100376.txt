On July 20th, 1944, German Army Colonel von Stauffenberg plans to assassinate Nazi leader Adolf Hitler with a briefcase-bomb, during a military conference, while other high-ranking plotters in Berlin are preparing to take power in a coup.
"The Plot to Kill Hitler" is a historical recreation of the 1944 attempt by several German High Command Officers to assassinate Adolf Hitler and take control of the German government. Lead by Wehrmacht Colonel Count von Staufenberg, this group of brave men managed to plant a bomb in Hitler's battlefield headquarters. By sheer luck, Hitler survived the blast and the SS quickly arrested and executed all those involved in the affair.
