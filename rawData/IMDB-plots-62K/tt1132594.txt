What to do when the workers of a factory have been laid off overnight? Louise has an original idea: why not pool the compensation money to ... hire a hit man and to liquidate the boss? Motion accepted so Louise goes in search of the gem they need and unfortunately comes across Michel, a stinky security specialist. Michel, who is busted, gladly accepts the deal but proves so inept that he sub-contracts the job to improbable novices. Moreover, as the factory was a mere branch of a multinational company, it is no bed of roses to find the one who actually made the decision to outsource its activities. But Louise will not give up so easily.
