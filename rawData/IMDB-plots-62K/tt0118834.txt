Friends of a recently deceased minor painter Jean-Baptiste take a train in Paris for Limoges, where he wished to be buried, and all the people on the train have their problems.
Charismatic artist and teacher Jean-Baptiste has died. He has asked to be buried in the provincial city of Limoges, where his family runs a shoe-making company. He had said, "those who love me can take the train." And here they are, in a Paris train station platform: lovers, old friends, casual acquaintances, and relatives. The long day in the lives of all these people is a journey toward illumination. At first the idea of spending a day in Limoges leaves them irritated and impatient. But as the train gets going, time begins to stand still and people start to talk, and laugh, and forget to behave themselves.
