An ad exec for a fashion magazine lands her dream assignment to organize the perfect Christmas wedding. Just one thing. The photographer she's been partnered with is her ex-boyfriend. She's got to bring her A game, while working through unresolved feelings.
In the approach to Christmas, Brie Traverston, an art director with a New York City media firm, is given the last minute three week assignment due Christmas Eve of designing a magazine spread on Christmas weddings, she making partner at the firm riding on how well she does on the assignment. The client, Isabella Elias, is flying in Paris based photographer Eddie Chapman for the assignment. The issue for Brie in doing a good job on this assignment?: Eddie is her NYU college sweetheart, who she has not seen in seven years since that Christmas he announced that he had been accepted into the Masters program in photography in Paris, but who she, in what was his "big news", was expecting him to ask her to marry him. Despite their vow to each other at that time to reconnect following her graduation from NYU in a year, they, out of circumstance, never did reconnect, that is until now. While Brie wants to keep her and Eddie's relationship strictly professional, she admits to herself and her assistant Megan Hocking that she still has feelings for him. Brie may get her Christmastime heart broken once again with Eddie if the rumors are true that he and Isabella are a couple and on the verge of their own happily-ever-after.
