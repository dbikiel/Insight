In a future where MRI technology can read your mind, the trial of the century soon begins when a defendant faces his own memory for a double murder he doesn't remember committing.
Henri Miller is a successful restaurateur and family man living the American dream until he collapses from what appears to be a cerebral hemorrhage. Raced to the hospital Henri's wife Margaret learns that he has been seeing a neurologist in an attempt to diagnose unexplained headaches since his childhood. With one test remaining, Dr. Pullman convinces Henri to have the new FVMRI procedure-an MRI-like machine that reads long-term memory in video form. When the test reveals that Henri shot and killed two people on his farm, the first Superior Court trial with evidence introduced by the defendant's own memory is soon underway. Although Henri has no recollection of this memory, upon broadcast in court Henri's father Joseph immediately falls ill having witnessed that exact memory. With time running out and Henri's guilt of second degree murder all but assured, Margaret's desperate attempt to clear her husband soon reveals that Henri's mind will answer to all crimes-those of the past, present and beyond.
