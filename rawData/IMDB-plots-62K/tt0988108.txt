An average guy of an Estonian high-school decides to defend his bullied classmate. This starts war between him and the informal leader of the class. As teenagers' honour is a touchy thing, everything ends in bloodshed.
Kaspar and the class pushover Joosep are 16 and life in high school isn't easy. Without meaning to, Kaspar defends Joosep against the bullying of his classmates, but every time Kaspar tries to him, it backfires, with the class taking it out on Joosep. Kaspar just wants his friends, his girl and his unassuming life back. Joosep wants to regain his dignity and the chance to switch to a high school far away. But their classmates are relentless, going further and further with each incident.
Shy nerd Joosep is the favorite victim of his macho classmates, mainly the jocks gang of cocky Anders, while the rest tends to applaud the unfair abuse 'show'. Joosep's father, a military macho, just tells him to 'stand up for yourself', not how. Rebuked by his girlfriend Thea for helping to lock stripped-naked Joosep in the girls' showers, jock Kaspar decides to shield Joosep from more gross abuse. He soon finds himself bullied as 'traitor', and later alleged 'queer buddy'. After Joosep takes his own stand out of principle and Kaspar's refusal to dub risks seeing him expelled and returned to his rural home, things escalate tragically.
In the class, Joosep is the one being harassed constantly. Kaspar has come from countryside and quite fitted in the other side. But a question springs up in his mind - what about honor? He doesn't like others bullying Joosep, but even more, he can't stand himself being on that side. He begins to defend Joosep, but his classmates are holding him away and taking it out on the other boy. Though both's life is hard and seems unbearable, Joosep has his dreams and hope, and therefore Kaspar thinks he can also live it through. Yet their relentless classmates are going too far and this hope gets completely consumed by desperate feelings.
