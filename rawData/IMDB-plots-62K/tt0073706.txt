A documentary about asia's shocking cultures.
This mondo film depicts graphic scenes from the Asian continent. We witness a mass piercing in India and cremated remains of human bodies dumped into the Ganges river in clear sight of bathers. The camera then shows Japanese sex clubs which reenact bizarre sexual rituals and S&amp;M fantasies. There is also a very graphic sex change operation in Singapore. There is also midget and female wrestling featured to round out the fun.
