Still on the run from a group of Nazi zombies, a man seeks the aid of a group of American zombie enthusiasts, and discovers new techniques for fighting the zombies.
If the worst day of your life consisted of accidentally killing your girlfriend with an axe, chain-sawing your own arm off, and watching in horror as your closest friends were devoured by a zombified Nazi battalion, you'd have to assume that things couldn't get much worse. In Martin's case, that was only the beginning.
This movie was the greatest sleeper movie since Boondock Saints. I saw the original to kill time, I have wasted an hour and a half in worse ways, and never thought a sequel would be made. HOLY SHIT THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME. High production value, plot moved very well, memorable lines, Nazis, a tank, gore, body counts, battles,it just goes on.It was better than Fury. Not going to write a thing about what happened so I don't spoil a second of it. Honestly, I would sell a kidney help make DEAD SNOW 3:White dead.Must see.
