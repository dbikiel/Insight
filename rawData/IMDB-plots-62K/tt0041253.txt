In Colorado territory, outlaw Wes McQueen escapes jail to pull a railroad robbery but, upon meeting pretty settler Julie Ann, he wonders about going straight.
Outlaw Wes McQueen is sprung from jail to help pull one last railroad job. He doesn't like his new partners - except dance-hall girl Colorado - and anyway fancies Julie Ann newly arrived from the east to set up home with her father. Maybe time to get out. Unfortunately he also has a $10,000 reward on his head, dead or alive.
Outlaw Wes McQueen breaks out of jail and meets up with his gang who are planning a train robbery. He finds them holed up in an old dilapidated Mission, arguing and one of them has a woman with him, a former dance hall girl, Colorado Carson. Wes has decided that he wants to go straight. Having met Julie Ann Winslow and her father Fred, his ideal would be to settle down with her and own his own ranch. Out of loyalty to an old-time partner however, he agrees to go ahead with the train robbery and realizes too late that he is not destined to fulfill his dreams. He and Colorado make a final desperate break when the robbery goes bad.
