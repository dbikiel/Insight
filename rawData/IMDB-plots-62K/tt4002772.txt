After losing her father to cancer, a teenage girl reluctantly joins her new stepcousin at a summer camp for Latter-day Saint (Mormon) girls.
Lane Speer is a 16-year-old girl who spends her family vacations camping in the mountains. She takes the memories for granted until she loses her father to cancer. Only a year later, Lane is still reeling from her father's death as her mother marries a guy that Lane hardly knows - a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. To top it off, while they are on their honeymoon, they arrange to have her stay with her LDS step-aunt who takes her away to a Bible-themed girls' camp with a bunch of young LDS girls. Confronted with memories of camping with her family, she tries to find peace with her new surroundings and deal with her father's death.
