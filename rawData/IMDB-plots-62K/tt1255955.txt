The story follows six very different men and their struggles with women, family and work. Yet, they are somehow connected to each other.
The gym "Fitnessworld" is where we meet our fighting gladiators - the protagonists of our episodic daisy chain about what it means to be a man. Philipp is a loveably chaotic fellow, whose professional dreams have just fallen apart. And when his casual girlfriend Nina informs him she's pregnant, Philipp is truly in over his head. His friend Niklas, though, has done everything right - always: university, marriage, single-family home. But is he happy? This question doesn't even occur to heart-throb Jerome - His life is one sensual rush. And then there's GÃ¼nther, the lonely trade inspector desperately seeking someone to belong to; and the abandoned subway driver Roland, fighting with all his might to get his family back. Many "male truths" - all searching for the right "design" for their lives, in this time of lacking orientation, where a MAN can be whatever he wants. They're all fighting for happiness. Who will come out ahead?
