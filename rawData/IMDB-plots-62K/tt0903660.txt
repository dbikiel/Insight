An overview of the politics, social effects and problems associated with the rising epidemic of American obesity.
Obesity rates in the United States have reached epidemic proportions in recent years. The Centers for Disease Control estimate that at least 110,000 people die per year due to obesity and 1/3 of all cancer deaths are directly related to it. Former Surgeon General Richard Carmona remarked that obesity is a more pressing issue than terrorism, 'Obesity is a terror within. It's destroying our society from within and unless we do something about it, the magnitude of the dilemma will dwarf 9/11 or any other terrorist event that you can point out...' From our human evolution and our changing environment to the way our government's public policies are actually causing obesity, Killer at Large shows how little is being done and more importantly, what can be done to reverse it.
Killer at Large also explores the human element of the problem with portions of the film that follow a 12-year old girl who has a controversial liposuction procedure to fix her weight gain and a number of others suffering from obesity, including filmmaker Neil Labute.The film features interviews and covers events with such notable public figures as Former President Clinton, Ralph Nader, Senators Tom Harkin and Sam Brownback, Arnold Schwarzenegger, former Surgeon General Richard Carmona and a number of bestselling authors and renowned experts like Michael Pollan, Barry Glassner (Bowling for Columbine), Dr. Kelly Brownell (Supersize Me), Dr. Barry Popkin (Penn and Teller's Bullshit) and many others.
