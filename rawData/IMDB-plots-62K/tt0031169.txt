George (George Formby) is an old stable hand and is the only one who can control a jittery racehorse.
George (George Formby) befriends a race horse only to discover that it has a reputation for attacking any jockey that comes near it just before a big race. There are the inevitable gang of villains, car chases, a comic brain specialist, and a girl for George to fall for and to sing his cheeky-chappie songs at.
