Two codependent roommates, on the verge of eviction, flee New York for the promise of sunshine in Los Angeles where their friendship is tested by a chance at fame, a fortune teller and an amorous wealthy aunt.
This comedy follows two codependent East Village, New York girls, Olivia and Nicole, on the verge of eviction and existential crisis. They're struggling artists, living in a Bohemian apartment. Their electricity has been turned off and they've begun an ill-advised juice fast. To top it all off, they're out of money and too "talented" to come up with the rent. To solve their problems they go to L.A. to visit Nicole's wealthy aunt, Kimberley, the host of a popular reality TV talent show. As Kimberley convinces the girls to audition, the girls struggle to maintain their friendship as Olivia begins to realize she may not be as dependent on Nicole as she once believed.
