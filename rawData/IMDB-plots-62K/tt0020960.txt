Brothers Monte and Ray leave Oxford to join the Royal Flying Corps. Ray loves Helen; Helen enjoys an affair with Monte; before they leave on their mission over Germany they find her in still another man's arms.
Two brothers attending Oxford enlist with the RAF when World War I breaks out. Roy and Monte Rutledge have very different personalities. Monte is a freewheeling womanizer, even with his brother's girlfriend Helen. He also proves to have a yellow streak when it comes to his Night Patrol duties. Roy is made of strong moral fiber and attempts to keep his brother in line. Both volunteer for an extremely risky two man bombing mission for different reasons. Monte wants to lose his cowardly reputation and Roy seeks to protect his brother. Their assignment to knock out a strategic German munitions facility is a booming success, but with a squadron of fighters bearing down on them afterwards, escape seems unlikely.
Just before WWI, brothers Monte and Roy Rutledge visit Germany with Karl, their German pal at Oxford . When war breaks out Karl is called back to Germany and ends up on a Zepplin bombing London. He directs the bombs so that they fall harmlessly in water. Monte and Roy join the RAF. They're not too happy about the war either, but they volunteer for a dangerous mission bombing a German munitions dump.
