The mighty warrior, Kain, crosses the barren wastelands of the planet Ura, where two arch enemies, Zeg and the evil degenerate Balcaz, fight incessantly for control of the village's only well.
The mighty warrior, Kain, crosses the barren wastelands of the planet Ura, where two arch enemies, Zeg and the evil degenerate Balcaz, fight incessantly for control of the village's only well. Kain sees his opportunity and announces that his sword is for hire...but his eyes stay clearly on the beautiful captive sorceress Naja, and his newly awakened purpose.
A powerful warrior named Kain, skilled in the use of many weapons, discovers two worthy opponents while traveling through a small village. There he also encounters a ravishing sorceress. His holy warrior gig now over, Kain roams the earth as a mercenary, selling his unequaled skill at arms to the highest bidder. He'll find plenty of work in the village of Yamatar. The commoners there are exploited or enslaved by a pair of rival warlords named Zeg and Bal Caz, who spend most of their time struggling for control of Yamatar's well, just about the only thing of real value for thousands of square miles. Kain may be just a sword for hire these days, but the old Homerac in him is rankled by what he sees in the village, and just for the hell of it, he decides to bring down both tyrants.
In the distant desert-planet, Ura, the powerful rival warlords, Zeg the Tyrant and Bal Caz, plunge the land in an eternal war over the community's last pure spring. Amid endless turmoil and rampant violence, the taciturn master of the blade, Kain, arrives at the war-torn village of Yamatar, bent on making a profit, until Naja, the enslaved sorceress, talks him into saving her long-suffering people. Now, in a dark age of mystery and sorcery, Kain must use his resourcefulness and his unparalleled fighting skills to live to fight another day, pitting both clans against each other. Can the fearless mercenary put an end to the oppressors' tyranny?
