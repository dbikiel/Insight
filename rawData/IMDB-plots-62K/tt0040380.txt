Two sons of a general try to prove that he did not give an order that resulted in the Indian massacre of a wagon train and army fort.
The Arizona wilderness, 1880. Gen. Fletcher Blackwell sends a message telling Capt. Walsh, who is escorting a wagon-train through Apache territory, heading for the fort at Furnace Creek, that he should cancel the escort and rush to another town. Apache leader "Little Dog" is leading the attack on the wagon-train and massacring everyone at the poorly manned fort. As a result the treaty is broken with the Indians and the white settlers take over the territory with the help of the calvary, as the Apaches are wiped out and only "Little Dog" remains at large. Gen. Fletcher Blackwell is court-martial-led for treason. The general's 2 sons, Cash Blackwell and Capt. Rufe Blackwell, each with a different disposition, go about trying to find evidence to clear their father's name.
The son of a U.S. Army general, unjustly accused of giving orders which resulted in a massacre in 1880, visits the boom-town of Furnace Creek, Arizona seeking evidence of his father's innocence. His brother, in town for the same reason and both using aliases, is brought to trial when a former army captain, from whom he had obtained a confession clearing the father, is murdered. He is found guilty and an agitated lynch mob is forming.
