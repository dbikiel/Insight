A portrait of fatherhood in crisis, and the strength of a child.
Belmonte paints forests full of trees, naked men in strange positions, submarine fantastic scenes, men/animals hybrid creatures, gravediggers characters, well-built men going up stairs to the leap, love scenes below trees. All of his work, sometimes full of colors, shows loneliness and melancholy, but also beauty and attraction to the human body. Even though Belmonte shows himself distant to some of his family members, he is an emotional man who needs affection all the time; he is especially dedicated to his daughter, Celeste. When Celeste isn't around Belmonte is kind of lost. There's a new and important exhibition upcoming at the National Museum of Montevideo but Belmonte is thinking more about the changes inside his family: his ex-wife got pregnant by another man, and he feels Celeste is going to spend less time with him. Belmonte negotiates with his ex-wife about the amount of days he should live with Celeste, he wants more, he needs more days; but is not easy, because his ex-wife argues that she wants to give Celeste a family ambient. The film follows Belmonte's point of view and focus on what he is attracted to, and how his sensitivity applies to his art. In a way, the film shows how creativity is mixed with domestic life, and how both things couldn't be separated because none of them will have sense alone. Belmonte, with an unique personality and cyclic mood, will have to manage to cross a middle age crises where new acquaintances and fantasies are starting to appear.
