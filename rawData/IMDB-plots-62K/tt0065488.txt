Tempers fray and true selves are revealed when a heterosexual is accidentally invited to a homosexual party.
It's Harold's birthday, and his closest friends throw him a party at Michael's apartment. Among Harold's presents is "Cowboy", since Harold may have trouble finding a cute young man on his own now that he's getting older. As the party progresses the self-deprecating humor of the group takes a nasty turn as the men become drunker. Climaxed by a cruel telephone "game" where each man must call someone and tell him (or her?) of his love for them.
At his New York loft apartment, Michael is hosting a thirty-second birthday party for his friend, Harold. According to Michael, the party consists of 'seven screaming queens': fey Jewish Harold, debt ridden preppy Michael, neurotic Donald, flamboyant Emory, "African queen" Bernard, and straight-acting couple Hank and Larry who are going through growing pains in their relationship. Unexpectedly thrown into the mix is Alan, Michael's married, straight and straight-laced Georgetown University roommate from out of town. His visit is bad timing for Michael as Michael assumes Alan knows nothing about his gay life; Michael wants to keep perpetuating the myth. But Alan's visit is not by accident, he who needs to speak to his old friend about an issue troubling him. The ninth and last person at the party is a fresh-faced, young and naive urban cowboy, who is Emory's birthday gift to Harold. Directed mostly by Michael, each exposes a little of himself throughout the evening, Michael who in the end is the most exposed.
A group of gay friends at a birthday party dissect their lives and relationships when a married straight friend unexpectedly appears.
