Centers on conceptual artist Tina (Reiner), when she introduces her eight-month pregnant art school rival (Hendricks) to her non-traditional surrogate Kiki (Camp). The truth comes outs and the patriarchy fights to hang on.
Tina is a New York artist whose husband, Wayne lives off her money and success. They invite her eight-months pregnant art school rival, Karen, a housewife and perfect wife and power hungry, new-money husband, Don to their Brooklyn loft, surprising them with Tina's new work-in-progress: a radical alternative to motherhood. Tina who is having a child via a surrogate, tells Karen that she couldn't stand having someone hanging off her breast all day. Karen retaliates that being pregnant makes her feel like a celebrity, and that she's sorry for people who don't have children. When the sensuous, non-traditional surrogate, Kiki arrives, the truth comes out, and the patriarchy fights to hang on by its teeth. And a tough debate broke out between ex-girlfriends, in which everyone tried to defend their opinion about surrogate motherhood. They reveal secrets.
