A group of ex-rough riders, an ex-prostitute and a gunfighter enter a horse race in the desert.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a newspaper organizes an endurance horse race: 700 miles to run in a few days. 9 adventurers are competing, among them a woman, Miss Jones, a Mexican, an Englishman, a young cowboy, an old one and two friends, Sam Clayton and Luke Matthews. All those individualists will learn to respect each other.
In 1906, the popular Western Post newspaper sponsored a demanding cross-country horse race, attracting a motley crew of ambitious contestants. With a tempting $2,000 prize, the bold competitors--including the plucky former prostitute, Miss Jones; the ex-Rough Riders, Luke Matthews and Sam Clayton; a Mexican vaquero with a terrible toothache; the English gentleman, Sir Harry Norfolk; an ageing cowhand, and the arrogant cowboy, Carbo--will have to endure 700 miles of unforgiving desert and rugged terrain. The race is on. Who has what it takes to bite the bullet?
