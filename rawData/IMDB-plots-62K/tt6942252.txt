In a remote town of Argentina, home remedies replace traditional medicine. All diseases are treated by the villagers except a mortal fear known as espanto, the dread. This rare illness can only be cured by an old man who very few dares to visit. The Dread is an investigative human interest documentary stuffed with strong humour and outstanding protagonists.
