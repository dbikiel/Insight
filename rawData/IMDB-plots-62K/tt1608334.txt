A look at a Bavarian commune of the Indian Bhagwan cult.
1980: Enlightenment comes to Niederaich. 12 year old Lili moves together with her mother Amrita and her Bhagwan followers to the Bavarian countryside, where primal scream therapy meets folklore and narrow-minded horizons. Accordingly, Lili has a hard time to adapt and to make friends. She can't cope with being the outsider, the village's oddball. Longing for acceptance, it becomes crucial to Lili to prove her 'ordinariness'.
