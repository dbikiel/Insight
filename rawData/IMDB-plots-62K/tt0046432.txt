When a terrorist plants a bomb on board a train, the police call in an army bomb disposal expert to find, and dismantle it, but after it has been made safe, he has another shock in store.
A terrorist has placed a bomb on board a train transporting sea mines to Portsmouth. The train is stopped but near a small town, which actually exacerbates the problem. In desperation, the local authorities contact Peter Lyncort, a former Canadian Royal Engineers munitions expert, and ask him to help them dismantle the explosive device. Peter accepts the assignment. He is given no more than five hours to achieve his dangerous mission.
