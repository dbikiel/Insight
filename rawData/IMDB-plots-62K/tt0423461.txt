The younger brother, Jong-hyeon (Won Bin) is a good-looking, class-A fighter. The older brother, Seong-hyeon (Shin Ha-gyun) is unbelievably tender and pure, a class-A student. They've been fighting, nearly non-stop for 17 years. Trouble began when their mother (Kim Hae-suk) favored Seong-hyeon over his younger brother. Round 2 began when both brothers fell for the same girl, the most beautiful girl in the neighborhood, Mi-ryeong (Lee Bo-yeong). When the long-simmering emotions finally explode and a huge fight breaks out, Seong-hyeon tells his younger brother something he had never been able to say before: "Jong-hyeon, would you call me hyeong just once? I've never heard it before from you..." "Hyeong" - the word that younger Korea brothers call their older brothers. And yet Jong-hyeon has never said it to his brother.
