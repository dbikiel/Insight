In the depths of a snowy forest in an unknown wartime, two soldiers from opposing armies try to outwit each other in a perilous game of Tic-Tac-Toe, until they find themselves outplayed by karma.
Amidst a senseless and perpetual war, an armed aircraft crashes behind the enemy lines in the middle of the unending and snow-covered Tundra and its downed pilot is taken hostage by a self-contained soldier. As the two men pass through the pathless and desolate forest with the hostage always at gunpoint, a game of wits and perseverance will begin to unfold. Who has what it takes to outsmart his opponent?
