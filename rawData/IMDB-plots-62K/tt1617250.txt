Famed nightclub performer Duke Mitchell is Paul, a paroled gangster with an unholy scheme: to kidnap the Pope and 'charge a dollar from every Catholic in the world' as the ransom. Shot in 1975, GONE WITH THE POPE was unfinished at the time of Duke Mitchell's death in 1981, and finally completed in 2009 from a rediscovered, unfinished print.
The tale of four ex-convicts who plan to venture to Rome in order to capture the Pope. Ransom: One dollar from every Catholic in the world.
