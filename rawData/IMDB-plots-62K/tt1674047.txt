A platoon of eagles and vultures attack Hollywood, California. Why did the eagles and vultures attack? Who will survive?
Following the events of Birdemic: Shock and Terror (2010), the sequel picks up where the first movie left off, and the birds and eagles are at it again. The attacks are greater this time, and there are even more threats around the corner: cavemen and zombies join the shock and terror in Birdemic 2.
