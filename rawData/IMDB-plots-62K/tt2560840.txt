Some bands deserve another shot, and another...and another...and another.
An unlikely and surprisingly personal narrative to conquer the loss of a friend emerges from an odyssey about the rise, fall and resurrection of an 80's metal band. The career of Frankie Banali, drummer of Quiet Riot, took a major sideswipe when his singer and best friend Kevin DuBrow died in 2007. In 2010 and at a cross roads in his life, Banali has to forge ahead and make a new life for himself and his daughter. The film follows him going through the emotional feat of trying to fill the void left by Kevin and get the band back together one more time.
The 104-minute character-driven documentary goes beyond the guts and glory of the common getting the band back together tale. "QUIET RIOT: Well Now You're Here, There's No Way Back" reveals an unforgettable man who uses ambition, adaptability, relentless determination and principle to navigate through a business, and a series of obstacles that are attempting to control his fate.
