In their blue hotel room, a clandestine couple of two married lovers plan an impossible future, as death shutters their already frail tranquillity. Now, the noose tightens more and more around innocents and sinners; but, was there a crime?
A man and a woman, secretly in love, alone in a room. They desire each other, want each other, and even bite each other. In the afterglow, they share a few sweet nothings. At least the man seemed to believe they were nothing. Now under investigation by the police and the courts, what is he accused of?
Julien Gahyde--the successful agricultural contractor and married family man--and the equally married pharmacist, Esther Despierre, are lovers. Under the noses of their unsuspecting partners, both plan an almost impossible shared future, beneath the bed sheets of their small and quiet blue-hued hotel room where they regularly meet. And then, unexpectedly, death shutters the clandestine couple's already frail tranquillity, as the noose tightens more and more around innocents and sinners. But, apart from a doomed affair, was there a crime?
