Preacher's kid Henry Gamble is turning 17 today. Bring your swimsuit.
HENRY GAMBLE'S BIRTHDAY PARTY takes place over the course of 24 hours, at the 17th birthday pool party of preacher's kid Henry Gamble. As Henry treads through various sexual possibilities, seeking to come into his own, so too do the adults and teenagers of the party, all struggling to navigate the public and private, and their longing, despite themselves and their faith, for earthly love.
Enveloped in a world of firm Evangelical Christian beliefs, Henry Gamble, a closeted teenager and son of a minister, prepares for his seventeenth birthday celebration party. Soon, both friends from the church and high school start arriving, accompanied by adult members of the congregation. Little by little, as one after another leap into the pool, a subtle yet clearly visible segregation between the two worlds, the religious and the secular, commences. It is still early in the morning, nevertheless, by the end of the party the burgeoning teenage sexuality, inextricably intertwined with awkward interpersonal relationships, unspoken feelings and irreconcilable inner conflicts, will inevitably lead to intimate personal revelations fueled by the irrepressible need to escape from conformity.
