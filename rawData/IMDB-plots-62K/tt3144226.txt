Vera is a cab driver who has been saving up for years to buy a house and settle on No Man-s Island in the Pacific and eventually escape from the world in which she lives. Zoli has what it takes to become a professional basketball player, but beats a cowardly retreat from his own talent. These two youngsters, each on the run in their own way, are then joined by Mia, the runaway bride. Their three lives clash and intermingle as they journey towards an unexpected solution. The film is a modern fairy tale about young people in search of true happiness who, through Mia-s ethereal purity, come to love themselves and find a way to realize their dreams.
