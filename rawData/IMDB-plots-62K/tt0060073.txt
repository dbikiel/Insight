The cruel acts of animal poaching and violence, executions, and tribal slaughtering, all taking place on the African continent.
From the producers of 'Mondo Cane' comes this violent document of a continent in transition; the change from white colonialism to independent black statehood. Often times, this resulted in the wholesale massacre of thousands of people and the indiscriminate extermination of wild life. Captured on film are mercenary killer squads wiping out entire villages, executions, Mau-Mau massacres and more!
