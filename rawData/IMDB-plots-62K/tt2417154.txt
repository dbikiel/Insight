Long before punk rock inflicted its puncture wound on the map of mainstream music, the Descendents were in a van brewing a potent mix of pop, angst, love and coffee and influencing a generation to come. FILMAGE: The Story of DESCENDENTS/ALL follows drummer and square-peg Bill Stevenson as he pushes himself and a rotating door of band-mates to "achieve ALL," his relentless concept of "going for greatness, the utmost possible" despite any and all setbacks. Interviews with the band and contemporaries such as Dave Grohl (Foo Fighters, Nirvana), Mark Hoppus (Blink-182), Mike Watt (Minutemen), Brett Gurewitz (Bad Religion) and many more reveal the untold tale of one of the most overachieving and influential bands in punk, serving as a reminder to always "go for greatness," because sometimes you're gonna get it.
