An account of the romance between the Maratha general, Baji Rao I and Mastani, princess of Bundelkhand.
Bajirao 1, who fought over 41 major battles and many others, was reputed never to have lost a single one of them. Bajirao is described as "RANMARD" a man made of and for the battlefield. Bajirao said to his brother "Remember that night has nothing to do with sleep. It was created by God, to raid territory held by your enemy. The night is your shield, your screen against the cannons and swords of vastly superior enemy forces. " A born cavalry leader Bajirao was unequaled for the daring and originality of his genius. Mastani, the fabled warrior princess was the daughter of Raja Chattrasal and his Persian wife Roohani Begum. An expert dancer, singer and warrior, Mastani is sent to battle at the head of the Bundelkhand army. A chance meeting on a war field where they fight on the same side, puts Bajirao and Mastani on a course of passionate love- that is unstoppable by either of their families, by war or by death itself.
