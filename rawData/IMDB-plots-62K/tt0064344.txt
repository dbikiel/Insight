Susanna travels to Paris with her small group of actors. There she saves Emperor Napoleon from rather painful predicaments, uncovers a number of nasty court intrigues and finds, with much skill and ability, the man of her choice.
Susanne Delberg, the Innkeeper of the Lahn," (referring to the 1967 film) moves to Paris with her small troupe at the invitation of Emperor Napoleon, whom she has recently saved from an assassination plot by the resistance. The band of merry entertainers takes a break from their journey at a deserted country lodge, where they discover an infant, apparently abandoned on the front steps. But the quiet is soon broken when Napoleon's troops storm the castle and arrest the puzzled Ferdinand, whom they mistake for the notorious resistance fighter, Baron Adrian von Ambras. Susanne rushes to the emperor for help, but he has bigger worries: his pending marriage to the Austrian Princess Luise appears to be washed up after rumors begin circulating among the people that he is infertile. Matters of the heart are Susannes specialty. She concocts a clever plan, sparing his Majesty once again from certain disaster.
