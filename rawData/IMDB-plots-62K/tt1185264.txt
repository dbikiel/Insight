After a prank goes awry and lands a hospital janitor in a coma, a group of doctors begin dying at the hands of the comatose patient who is extracting revenge through out-of-body experiences.
A young doctor in a US hospital administers a powerful and untested cocktail of drugs to a coma victim. But instead of curing him, it triggers a powerful "out-of-body" experience and enables the patient - a depraved and dangerous loner - to inhabit other people's bodies and, through them, take revenge on the bullying medical students who were accidentally responsible for his condition. The doctor, who was herself a part of this group, is also targeted and as her colleagues are singled out and relentlessly picked off, she realises that she can trust no-one - friend or stranger - as this comatose killer moves in and out of bodies at will, getting ever closer as his murderous supernatural powers increase.
Often known as Red Mist this terror tale stars Arielle Kebbel as Catherine Thomas, one of a group of medical students responsible for accidentally rendering a sleazy janitor comatose in revenge for his voyeuristic actions. But when the remorseful Catherine administers an untested cocktail of wonder drugs, the patient is jolted into a startling out-of-body state, allowing him to murderously possess each student in turn.
