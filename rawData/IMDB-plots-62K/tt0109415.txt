Two brothers connected to the murderous children's cult of Gatlin, Nebraska are taken to Chicago by an adoptive couple.
Two young Gatlin residents are orphaned after the younger brother kills their father. So, the terror of Gatlin goes urban when the two boys are placed in the custody of two foster parents. The younger brother (who by this point is established as the "evil one") bought some corn seeds along for the road and plants them in the courtyard of an abandoned warehouse, bring He Who Walks Behind the Rows to the city. He winds up possessing his high school peers, and soon his older brother feels called to stop him.
After a farmer is killed in Gatlin, 2 boys are left orphaned. In Chicago they are welcomed by foster parents. The younger brother (Eli) becomes the fathers favourite and the older brother (Joshua) becomes the mothers favourite. Eli plants a cornfield and the mother wants to get rid of it. Eli gets everyone in school to follow He who walks behind the rows and Joshua tries to stop him!
