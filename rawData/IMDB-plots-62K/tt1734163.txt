A documentary about young Eastern European women who've been drawn into a netherworld of sex trafficking and abuse. It is a story told by survivors; a film that gives a voice to women who were supposed to be silenced by shame, fear and intimidation. Mimi Chakarova, a photojournalist who grew up in Bulgaria, takes us on a personal, investigative journey into the shadowy world of sex trafficking from Eastern Europe to Turkey, Dubai and Greece. Told through the personal accounts of trafficked women, undercover footage, and still photography, this documentary exposes the root causes of why women continue to be sold into prostitution against their will and examines what can be done to stop it.
