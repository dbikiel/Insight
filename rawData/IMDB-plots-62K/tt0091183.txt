Lazy, womanizing Jack gets employed at the NYC HQ of the multinational conglomerate, INC. Crazy chaos, promotions, firings, suicides etc. seem to be the way of the day.
Upon graduation from college with a business degree, John Issel is promptly hired by Helmes's company I.N.C. At INC, the one who gets ahead, does it by kissing ass, or over someone else's dead body. John keeps getting promotions, but cant figure out why. Actually management doesn't care about him, they hope that having hired him, his father, Senator Issel, will vote the way they like.
