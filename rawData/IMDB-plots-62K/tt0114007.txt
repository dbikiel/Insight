A raw depiction of the Belfast, Northern Ireland "troubles" as savage tribal warfare. Set shortly after the 1975 cease fire, this movie focuses on the tribulations of Kenny (James Frain), Protestant leader of a group of Shankill Road Loyalists, and his one-time friend Liam (John Lynch), a Catholic.
