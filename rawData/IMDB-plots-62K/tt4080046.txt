"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth" is the life motto of 30-year-old Agnieszka. After serving five years in prison, Agnieszka flees Poland for Germany in an attempt to start over. In Munich she meets the lonely 70-year-old Madame, boss of an escort agency. The woman provides her with a refuge and a job: Agnieszka begins to work as a dominatrix for Madame. She becomes like a daughter to her. All seems well until a much younger boy falls in love with Agnieszka. Madame will not stand any competition.
Without a penny in her pocket and on the run from her own past, Agnieszka leaves her native Poland overnight. In Munich she meets Madame, a former ballet diva, who provides her with a refuge and a job: Agnieszka starts to work as a dominatrix for Madame. She becomes like a daughter to her. All seems well until 16-year-old Manuel falls in love with Agnieszka. Madame will not stand any competition.
Without a penny in her pocket and on the run from her past, Agnieszka (30) leaves her native Poland in the middle of the night. In Munich she meets the former ballet star Aunt Lisbeth (70), who has now faded entirely from the public eye. She gives the anchorless Agnieszka sanctuary and a job: she starts to work for Aunt Lisbeth as a domina. When Agnieszka meets the 16-year-old Manuel, falling undyingly in love with him, developments pile up. Torn between her loyalty to Aunt Lisbeth and her feelings for Manuel, Agnieszka finds the courage to regain her gentleness.
