Vienna 1905: After a carnival party the famous painter Heidenick draws his otherwise engaged girlfriend Anita Helfer with very few clothes on, only blurs her face. The image makes it into the newspaper the next day - but since he can't tell the model's name without offending her influential fianc√©e, he comes up with the fictional name Leopoldine Dur. Unfortunately there is a secretary with that name, who now gets into the focus of high society - and into Heidenick's, much to Anita's anger.
