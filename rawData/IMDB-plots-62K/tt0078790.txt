The adventures of two idiotic outlaw wannabees, Amos and Theodore.
Amos and Theodore the two bumbling outlaw wannabees from The Apple Dumpling Gang (1975) are back. They are trying to make it on their own. When they arrive at the town, all sorts of things go awry. They accidentally subdue the town's legendary lawman, "Wooly" Bill Hitchcock, thus enraging him into tracking them down. They also are accused of bank robbery, and they "enlist" in the Army, and burn down the fort. Amidst all this, the Army is beseiged by someone stealing their supplies.
