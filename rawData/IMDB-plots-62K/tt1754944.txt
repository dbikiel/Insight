A gay man nearing 30, and in a 7-year relationship rut, taps into an otherworldly Internet ad that starts omnisciently controlling his life.
Marshall is a cocky young ad man working at a dead-end job for a boss who overlooks his talents. After seven years with his boyfriend, Gabe, Marshall's love life has become too comfortable. On top of that, he's turning 30! He is desperate for a new life. He goes looking for it online, where he comes upon a mysterious app called "eCupid" that guarantees to find true love. From the moment he downloads it, "eCupid" scans every inch of Marshall's online world and instantly turns his life upside down. Marshall suddenly gets everything he thinks he wanted. Newly single and ready for adventure, "eCupid" overwhelms Marshall with sexy guys at every turn, each promising to be the man of his fantasies. But too much of a good thing may not be a good thing. Marshall soon finds that all the attention is more than he bargained for. With the help of a wise and mysterious waitress (Morgan Fairchild), Marshall is given one last chance to listen to his heart and figure out what (and who) is really important.
