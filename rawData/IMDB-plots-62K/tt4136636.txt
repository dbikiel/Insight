A boy must brave deep winter snow to obtain an important family keepsake. Before he can even start this difficult journey he must first help his family survive financial ruin, rescue his beloved pet goat, and with his best friend, outwit a bratty bully who seems out to get him at every turn. Will he make it back to the village in time to celebrate the end-of-winter holiday of Chalandamarz?
Swiss alpine farm boy Ursli loves mountain life, however poor his family is, but when his father looses the annual cheese production on the perilous mountain way to sneaky mayor Armon's shop, they get in bad debt and his mother must go work in the city. Armon's s spoiled-rotten brat son Roman, who helped steal the floating cheese, looks down on penniless Ursli, but is constantly outsmarted in the Graub√ºnden village school. As Ursli's father can't pay off his debt, Roman meanly demands kid goat Tiny, Ursli's prize pet, unfit for the shop. As first spring month March arrives, the boys are to be assigned cow bells to proudly carry in the Chalandamarz parade, and Ursli counted on the new big one his blacksmith uncle made as a birthday present, but due to debt Roman can confiscate that too. Ursli's luck turns however as adversity strikes.
