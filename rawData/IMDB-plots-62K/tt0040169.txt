Two frontiersmen try to avenge the murder of a struggling rancher.
When Hadley finds gold on his land, Kirby kills him and then goes after Hadley's ranch. After Eddie Dean foils Kirby's robbery attempt, Kirby forces the assistant land agent Tuttle to sell the ranch to him. But Eddie learns of the forgery thru Tuttle's boss and goes after Kirby.
John Hadley (Steve Clark (I)') discovers a rich vein of gold ore in an abandoned mine on his ranch but doesn't tell his daughter, Janet (Shirley Patterson), or son Larry (Steve Drake). Dan Kirby (Terry Frost), local saloon owner, and his henchman, Al Cooper (Lane Bradford), spot Hadely at the mine and, learning that it is still a secret, kill him. Unable to find their missing father, Larry and Janet are forced to borrow payroll money from Harvey Allen (George Chesebro), local land-company head, promising to pay it off after the spring roundup. But Larry is robbed by KIrby and his henchmen. Eddie Dean and his sidekick, "Soapy" Jones (Roscoe Ates) ride in just as the robbers are making a getaway. They give chase and shoot the one carrying the money. Eddie agrees to stay on as ranch foreman. Allen takes a trip and Kirby forges a document and buys the mortgage and then plans to kill Kirby by intercepting the stagecoach he is returning on. Eddie learns of this and decides to ride shotgun on the stagecoach. But Kirby changes his plan, kills Allen in town and places the blame on Eddie. Eddie has his work cut out for him.
