A story about the ins and outs of one unusual health facility in the early twentieth century, run by the eccentric Dr. John Harvey Kellogg.
A madcap portrayal of William Lightbody's (Matthew Broderick's) stay at the health farm run by cereal King Dr. John Harvey Kellogg (Sir Anthony Hopkins). William's wife, Eleanor (Bridget Fonda), has persuaded him to go to Kellogg to have his system cleaned of impurities. Kellogg is very unconventional, and almost barbaric in his treatments.
In Wellville, at Battle Creek, eccentric rich Dr. John Harvey Kellogg (Sir Anthony Hopkins) runs a stylish health farm for the wealthy, an idea ahead of its time, based on extreme vegetarianism, neither sex, masturbation, nor even sensual stimulation, but laughing therapy and purging the "polluted" body, mainly by exercises, often in open air, vicious diet, his invention corn flakes, laxatives, anal yogurt cure, enemas, and brutal mechanical cleansing. Eleanor Lightbody (Bridget Fonda) drags her sickly, incredulous husband William (Matthew Broderick) along to the therapy. The couple is almost immediately separated and getting horny for more available members of the opposite sex. Kellogg's stubbornly willful adopted son (amongst over thirty kids) George (Dana Carvey) is a filthy embarrassment, paid off just to stay away. Charles Ossining (John Cusack) panics when arriving in Battle Creek. He finds his aunt's fortune made him partner in the empty shell health food company "Per-fo", not the planned cornflakes factory. However, with a former Wellville employee and George's name, they hope to get rich from their own cornflakes brand. When an electric therapy goes fatally wrong and several other patients die, Will's incredulous reluctance turns to panic.
Matthew Brodericks uptight Edwardian newlywed visits a new age health farm run by crackpot doc Anthony Hopkins. Scatologically-obsessed satire from director Alan Parker.
