A group of women in Morocco make a living as prostitutes in a culture that is very unforgiving toward women in that profession.
Noha is the queen bitch in her circle of upmarket whores, consisting of Soukaina and Randa and their trusty Egyptian driver and bodyguard. They spend a lucrative night at a villa rented by a bunch of Saudi guys and filled to the brim with hookers. While Noha provocatively flaunts herself and earns her keep, Ahmed takes a shine to Soukaina, who feels she's hit paydirt since the guy can't get it up and instead reads her poetry. Soukaina is younger in her prime, and still attached to the penniless lover Katib who hovers disconsolately near their flat. Newbie Randa, who is a modern girl dresses less seductively than the others, is apparently lesbian, but for some reason this angle is told but not seen. When Hlima, a plump country bumpkin joins forces with them, they are a complete off-beat dysfunctional family, who even go on a vacation together. The girls are amazingly vulgar when they talk, adding a sense of heightened realism to their characters. When not plying her trade, Noha dons a hijab and formless dress to visit her estranged family; jobless brother, high school student sister and mother, who looks after her young son; though censorious, the mother greedily takes whatever money her daughter gives, symbolizing a two-faced society happy to profit from the sex trade while treating its workers like garbage. This sort of hypocrisy turns up regularly in the movie as with the character of Amine, a nasty cop willing to overlook Noha's profession as long as he gets some action.
Marrakech today, Noha, Randa, Soukaina, Hlima and others live a life of love for sale. They're whores, objects of desire. Full of joy and a sense of complicity, dignified and free in their kingdom of women, they overcome the violence of a society that takes advantage of them while at the same time condemning them.
