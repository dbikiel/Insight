An American reporter smuggling news out of Soviet Moscow is blackmailed into helping a beautiful Communist leave the country.
McKinley B. "Mac" Thompson, American reporter in Moscow, smuggles out uncensored news under the alias "Comrade X," but hotel valet Vanya discovers his secret. Vanya fears for the safety of his daughter Golubka ("Theodore") and blackmails Mac into helping her leave the country. Mac is happier about his task once he meets lovely Theodore, but can he convince her of his sincerity? The anti-communist humor becomes alternately grim and farcical.
The film is set in 1940, shortly after the United States recognized the Soviet Union, and just before Russia became a valued ally in the war against Hitler. In this era of American ambivalence towards Russia, an American reporter is smuggling news out of Russia under the nom de plume 'Comrade X.' A hotel employee discovers his identity and blackmails him into taking the employee's beautiful pro-communist daughter out of the country.
