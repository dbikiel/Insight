Michal goes on a business trip to his home town, which unexpectedly turns into an inner journey to his long-forgotten past.
Michal, aged 34, is leading a prosperous, well-rounded life with his wife and son, a nice apartment, and a job in a large accounting office.
Unexpectedly, just before his son's first communion, Michal is sent by his employer to his home town to pick up a car imported from the USA. He goes reluctantly, hoping the business is carried out quickly. Michal picks up the car, but before leaving town he visits his father, with whom he's been in bitter conflict for years. At his wife's request, he invites his father to their son's first communion. The father rejects the invitation and the conversation ends in a quarrel. After this visit, an upset Michal gets into the car. His plans of a quick return are thwarted on the spot, however. Things take a different turn. There is a car accident and Michal has to stay in town a couple of days longer. He has to wait.
As he walks through the city streets, he encounters people he used to be close with, but who he left several years ago; he visits familiar places, so important for him in the past. Something awakens inside him during this trip; something he had long forgotten about. He tries to fight it. A banal trip turns into an emotional journey towards a life he no longer remembered.
