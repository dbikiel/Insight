A giant, ancient moth begins to attack Japan when coming to the rescue of its two, foot-tall worshippers who were taken by shipwreck survivors.
Shipwreck survivors are found on Beiru Island (Infanto tô), which was previously used for atomic tests. The interior is amazingly free of radiation effects, and they believe that they were protected by a special juice that was given to them by the island's residents. A joint expedition of Rolisican and Japanese scientists explores Beiru and discovers many curious things, including two women only one foot (30 centimeters) high. Unscrupulous expedition leader Clark Nelson abducts the women and puts them in a vaudeville show. But their sweet singing contains a telepathic cry for help to Mothra, a gigantic moth that is worshiped as a deity by the island people. The giant monster heeds the call of the women and heads to Tokyo, wreaking destruction in its path.
Members of a joint Japanese-Rolisican expedition go to Infant Island, the scene of H-Bomb testing by the Rolisican government, and find that the heavily radiated island still holds life; two beautiful young women, the Shôbijin, only a foot high and singing guardians of Mothra, a sacred egg. Nelson, one of the Rosilican members, returns to the island to kidnap the twins and plans to exhibit them around the world. The egg hatches a gigantic insect larva that crawls into the sea. When the larva, now grown even more gigantic, reaches Tokyo, it wreaks havoc before it begins to spin a cocoon. Rolisican and Japanese troops attack it but their atomic-ray weapons only speed the metamorphosis of the larva into an adult moth of colossal size, impervious to all their weapons.
