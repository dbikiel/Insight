Two men are stranded at the bottom of a well. One, with a serious injury to his head, thinks his has fallen in is own back garden in present-day Britain. But the other tells him they are really prisoners in a medieval dungeon. Who is right, and where are they really?
At the bottom of a deep stone-walled dry well, a man wakes up, only to see another man already there. Without a doubt, both strangers are hopelessly trapped, moreover, after a brief conversation, it is quite obvious that they have a completely different understanding of their environment: the former strongly believes that he is inside an ordinary well, while the latter, is convinced that they are in the bowels of a dismal dungeon. There is only one way to find out the truth.
