A song-and-dance man and his comic partner undergo romantic ups and downs when they team up with a female duo and transition from burlesque to vaudeville.
Four young hopefuls, George, Connie, Joan and Eddie, doing the Burlesque and Amateur Circuits meet by chance, and decide to form a team. Of course, their act is a success, and they finally make it to Vaudeville! George is crazy for Connie, however, George's ex-flame, Nancy Gai isn't too thrilled and from the moment she hears about George and Connie tying the knot, she does everything to break up their union... sadly, one night she succeeds, and the foursome go separate ways. Connie divorces George, and gets engaged to a rich agent, and makes it on her own- singing in an upper-class Boston Night Club, while Eddie and Joan still keep a successful couple act, but George ends up in a sleazy San Francisco bar, singing for drinks. After all, one minute you're the toast of the town, the next - you're in the gutter. Isn't that Show Business? Can the group be reunited? Can they be a success once more!?
