Alexander, Boris and Vasily are three old friends, who now rarely see each other as they are busy with their professional life. They embark on long-planned voyage on a raft down the Volga river, which turns into a series of comical accidents but also strengthens their friendship.
Once upon a time, three young comrades lived on a Moscow outskirts: Aleksandr the "Cat's Barin", Boris the "Chizhik" and Vasiliy the "Turkey". Floating on an old boat on the river Yauza and fantasizing about traveling along the big river, they swore to each other someday to meet and realize their dream.
