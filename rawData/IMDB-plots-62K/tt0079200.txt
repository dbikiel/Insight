In St. Tropez, French gendarme Cruchot and his men battle petroleum-drinking, human-looking, metallic aliens.
The bungling inspector Cruchot (Fun√®s) finds himself trying to save the residents of St. Tropez from some oil-drinking humanoid aliens. The only way to tell the aliens from the real people, besides their constant thirst for oil-products, is that they sound like empty garbage cans when you touch them. Chaos is ahead.
