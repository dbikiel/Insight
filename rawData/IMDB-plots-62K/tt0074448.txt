At the airport terminal lobby a husband and wife are parting calmly but seemingly for good. Unlike his wife Ema, the medical doctor Meluzin (Rudolf Hrusínský) is returning to his home country. He has become a district doctor in an area that reminds him of his childhood. He is given a room in the health-care center next to the flat of a childless Kodet's married couple. The chairman of the Local National Committee Vlach (Josef Somr) can't stop wondering why Meluzin has left his prestigious position at his former clinic, but in time the considerate doctor wins his trust, and the trust of his patients.
