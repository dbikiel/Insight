A successful family man, who works for an airline, becomes consumed by fear of death after his colleague and best friend dies in front of him from heart attack while telling the setup for the joke: "Why don't Italians like barbecues?"
Ray is a man obsessed with his own mortality. When Ray's best friend dies of a heart attack, Ray is convinced that all of his aches and pains are an indication of his own imminent death. His life turns into a slapstick farce of health-crazed anxiety and hypochondria, until he finally learns that all he has to fear is fear itself.
