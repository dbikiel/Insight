During a joint dinner at the restaurant, the neighbors offer to exchange wives for one night. It was a joke, but only at first.
Richard and Priscilla Parker's lives take a turn for the better when Eddy and Kay move into the house next door. Eddy's a risk-taker and shows his new neighbours how to enjoy life at the expense of a rule or convention or two. What Richard doesn't realize is that Eddy's little games are just a prelude to something that's intended to destroy his neighbours' lives.
The Parkers are a normal couple, who meet the Otises - their new neighbours. They enjoy life, travel a lot, earn and spend money - Soon, their friendship becomes deeper, as they spend a lot of time together. The two men and two women get along well with each other, perhaps too well. Eddy proposes to Richard a couple exchange - just for one night. He doesn't think it's right, but Eddy's obsessed with it.
