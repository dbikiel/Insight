What's "Auto-tainment?" Frankly, we don't know. But Larry the Cucumber is pretty sure it involves an automated set from the future, singing robotic children and some of your favorite veggies performing bizarre renditions of classic songs like "Zaccheus," "Hole in the Bottom of the Sea" and Gilbert &amp; Sullivan's "Modern Major General." All that and a whole lot more ... plus Bob and Larry learn that God still loves them even when the future doesn't work out quite the way they had hoped.
