Set during the final days of the admired photo development system known as Kodachrome, a father and son hit the road in order to reach the Kansas photo lab before it closes its doors for good.
The film is based on A.G. Sulzberger's 2010 New York Times article "For Kodachrome Fans, Road Ends at Photo Lab in Kansas" about a father and son who take a road trip to Kansas in order to develop photographs at Kodak's last Kodachrome lab before it closes its doors forever.
