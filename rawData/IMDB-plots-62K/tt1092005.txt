A man is sandwiched between his over possessive wife and a police inspector, where he is suspected for adultery and murder.
Obsessed with day-time TV soaps, Ekta Santoshi starts suspecting her husband, Gopal, of having an affair with an unknown woman. Not satisfied with his explanations, she decides to investigate, setting off a chain of hilarious events. These involve her dumb brother/hair-stylist, Lucky; her sister-in-law, Esha, who loves ACP Madhav Singh Ghai; two individuals both named Anthony Gonsalves; amongst many others that result in a hapless Gopal's arrest for the homicide of his co-worker, Subodh Mehra.
