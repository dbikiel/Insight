Jody is convinced, but unable to prove, that her ex-husband has been molesting their daughter Samantha. When the courts order joint custody for Samantha, Jody takes her and heads underground. The underground is a well protected system that moves her from town to town to keep her out of the hands of the courts. Her husband is relentless in having detectives try to find Jody and Sam, but after a time, Jody begins to feel comfortable and even begins to date a veterinarian she meets in a small town.
