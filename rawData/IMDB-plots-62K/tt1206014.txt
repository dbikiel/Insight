My grandmother??s lodging house situated at the corner of Shakespeare and Victor Hugo streets in Mexico City. When I was ten years old I met one of them. His name was Jorge Riosse. My grand mother remembers him as a very special young man that filled up her life with art and love. But she also suspects that he murdered a dozen women.
