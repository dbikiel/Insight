A medical reseracher teams with a retired doctor to root around in the genetically stored memories of a serial killer.
Dr. Taylor Biggs (Billy Zane) is haunted by a past that's not his own. A hallucinatory drug gives him the power to see visions of vicious crimes, visions made all that more disturbing when he discovers that the murderous memories may belong to the father he never knew (Dennis Hopper). Deirdre Blades co-stars as Biggs's mother, whose own failing memory makes her powerless to help him unravel his family history.
