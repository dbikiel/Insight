This is a survival story - a Hemingway's 'Old Man and the Sea' as if written for our days.
Hemingway's "Old Man and the Sea" is reset in the severe winter steppes of Kazakhstan where merciless wolves are awaiting their prey. How far can an old man go, lost in a snowstorm and faced with ferocious beasts, in order to protect his beloved sheep and his own life?
