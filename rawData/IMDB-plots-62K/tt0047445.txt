In mediaeval Japan a compassionate governor is sent into exile. His wife and children try to join him, but are separated, and the children grow up amid suffering and oppression.
Banished to a distant 11th-century province by a pitiless feudal lord for standing up for the rights of his impoverished people, a virtuous and compassionate governor leaves behind his wife, Tamaki, his young son, Zushio, and his younger daughter, Anju, to fend for themselves. However, an even crueller fate awaits the family of the righteous administrator, when--during an arduous journey on foot to reunite with him--the mother gets separated from her helpless children. Now, under the roof of the cruel bailiff, Sansho, a new reality crushes the torn family's noble dreams; however, can life's insuperable obstacles break the resilient human spirit?
