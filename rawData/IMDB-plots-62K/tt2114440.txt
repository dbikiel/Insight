Elif is a young teacher who is about to face the dark past. Made the wrong time, a terrible magic.
Based on an often told true story, Haunted 2 is a psychological thriller and horror film like its predecessor, Haunted.
Elif seems to lead a happy and fulfilled life, but shes continually haunted by mysterious voices, has frequent asthma attacks and nightmares she can make no sense of. This repetitive chain of unnerving experiences puts an increasing strain on Elif; its made all the worse because she can neither account for it, nor see a way out. The cause of it all goes back to a grave error of judgment made long in the past: a horrific and irreversible spell cast in the wrong place at the wrong time...
Elif sets off on a journey to confront her shadowy past and unravel the mystery behind her terrifying daily ordeal. But its a journey full of unexpected nasty surprises: surprises as unfathomable as they are horrific; surprises that lead Elif into a path from which theres no turning back...
