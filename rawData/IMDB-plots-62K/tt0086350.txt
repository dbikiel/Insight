A TV reporter and cameraman are taken hostage on a tugboat while covering a workers strike. The demands of the hostage-takers are to collect all the nuclear detonators in the Charleston, SC area so they may be detonated at sea. They threaten to detonate a nuclear device of their own if their demand isn't met.
A perfectly typical broadcast evening on a major network is interrupted by a shocking special news bulletin. Anchorman John Woodley and his partner, Susan Myles, reveal that terrorists have threatened to detonate an H-bomb off of the coast of South Carolina if the Navy refuses to agree to their demands -- the disarmament of a key nuclear weapons facility. Soon, the local team covering the story in Charleston is taken hostage and becomes the terrorists' mouthpiece.
