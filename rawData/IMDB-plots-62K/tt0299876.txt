Entrepreneurs visit a Chilean town, where they temporarily allow the fishing of a shellfish in danger of extinction.
When the Chilean officials lift the ban on harvesting the shellfish "el loco" (which purportedly is an aphrodisiac) in the seaside village of Puerto Gala greed and lust take hold. Greed is embodied by Carlos Maldonato, "El Canuto," who attempts to buy all of the shellfish for a Japanese company, and by a traveling band of prostitutes that accompany the influx of fishermen. El Canuto also wrangles to get into good stead with an old flame, Sonia, who is now the proprietor of "La Pincoya," a local restaurant. But "el loco" proves more effective, and more damaging, than anyone could have guessed.
In the winter of Chile, the government allows for a short period the harvesting of the valuable and aphrodisiac shellfish "el loco". Along these days, the seaside village of Puerto Gala lodges fishermen and prostitutes, all of them expecting to make money. The crook Canuto, who loves the owner of a local bar Sonia, convinces his friend Jorge, the priest Luis and the whole community to sell the production to a Japanese agent. After the selling, people disclose a secret with tragic consequences.
