Set in Chellanam, Kochi, the story of Ee. Ma. Yau revolves around the death of Vavachan Mesthiri in a coastal village. It showcases the events that unfold between two evenings and looks at death from different perspectives.
The film journeys into the complex web of human relationships, customs, rituals, and beliefs that express and mark life as well as death. The spectral atmosphere of a maritime culture that has drawn its economic survival, cultural sustenance and spiritual traditions from a long and tumultuous history of colonial conquests is palpable in the visual treatment and narrative pace of EeMaYou.
