"Kicki has after several years abroad returned to Sweden. Her 17-year old son has been brought up by his grandmother and has a very distant relationship to his mother. In an effort to get reacquainted Kicki invites her son to join her on vacation in Taiwan. But her hidden agenda is that Taipei is also the home of the Taiwanese businessman with whom she has been conducting an Internet romance".
Viktor visits Taiwan with his mother Kicki. He secretly hopes to meet the father he has never seen, but his mother's heart is completely elsewhere. Conflicts arise between them, and as Viktor gets closer with his Taiwanese friend Didi, the gap between mother and son widens.
