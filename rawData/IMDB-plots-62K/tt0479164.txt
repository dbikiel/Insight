A mysterious DJ is sent to a city block to mend a series of chain reactions that occur in our everyday lives.
Straight from the gates of the heavenly realm, a benevolent spirit-DJ enters our dimension with only one thing on his mind: to right the wrongs. Before long, he lands on a bustling street where he witnesses a car accident, and without delay, he opens up his metal cases to assemble his divine twin turntables to solve the problem. However, for every action, there are always consequences.
