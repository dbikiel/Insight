In the 21st century, prisoners aboard penitentiary space ships explore unknown worlds.
Our main character lands on a supposedly uninhabited strange new world, where he is instead greeted as a "hero" and treated like royalty. He soon finds out that heroism has a price: he has to commit a crime so that he may be publicly executed in a glorious ceremony.
