Said to be based on fact, the residents of new houses experience disturbing supernatural phenomena. They find out that their houses are built on land formerly used as a cemetery.
Jean and Shag Williams locate a newly built house and decide it's perfect for them to buy. One thing the developers forgot to tell them about was that it is built on a graveyard. Within days toilets start to flush by themselves and the garage door moves up and down by it's own accord. Will Jean and Shag realise that the place may be haunted by ghosts before it's too late.
