Consisting of three separate stories, the director explores "Man" as a theme: birth, life and death, to present a sometimes comic, sometimes tragic portrait of life at the bottom of the socio-economic pile.
The movie consists of three episodes that explore the lives of poor and desperate in Iran. All three episodes examine the futile struggle of the down-trodden. In episode one, a very poor couple with many crippled and retarded children abandon their newly born baby in hopes that the baby will have a better future. In the second episode, a mentally impaired and isolated young man tries to take care of his senile mother who is almost dead. In the third episode, a coward and desperate peddler tries to escape from his boss.
