As the Berlin Wall crumbles, Katrine, the daughter of a Norwegian woman and a German occupation soldier, finds her idyllic life disrupted as she refuses to testify a trial against the Norwegian state on behalf of her fellow "war children."
Europe 1990, the Berlin wall has just crumbled: Katrine, raised in East Germany, now living in Norway since 20 years, is a war child: the result of a love relationship between a Norwegian woman and a German occupation soldier during World War II. Katrine enjoys a happy family life, with her mother, her husband, daughter and grand-daughter. But when a lawyer asks her and her mother to witness in a trial against the Norwegian state on behalf of the war children, she resists. Gradually, a web of concealment and secrets is unveiled, until Katrine is finally stripped of everything, and her loved ones are forced to take a stand: What carries more weight, the life they have lived together, or the lie it is based on?
In Norway, Katrine Evensen Myrdal is a middle-aged woman happily married with Navy Commander Bjarte Myrdal. Katrine loves her daughter Anne that is a single mother; her granddaughter Turid; and her mother Ase Evensen that helps Anne to raise Turid. Katrine's father was a German occupation soldier during the World War II and Katrine was taken by the German government and raised in the Sachsen Orphanage in East Germany. At the age of 20, Katrine escapes from East Germany and comes to Norway to meet her mother. In November 1990, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the German lawyer Sven Solbach seeks Katrine and her mother out to give the testimony in a trial against the Norwegian state on behalf of the war children. Katrine refuses to testify, but Ase accepts and turns the life of her daughter upside-down when Sven discloses hidden dark secrets from her life.
