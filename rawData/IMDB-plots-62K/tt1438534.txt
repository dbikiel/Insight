A group of friends travel into the Australian wilds to view ancient cave paintings but soon find a horrible sickness gripping one of their own, which leaves them with nothing in their mind but a primal blood lust.
Anja and five friends join anthropology student Dace on a journey to study a remote ancient rock painting. Their excitement vanishes when Mel becomes delirious after skinny-dipping in the waterhole. Feverish bleeding and confused she physically and mentally regresses to a vicious predatory state. Mel has gone primal. Mel's lover and friends realize they are the prey as she savagely hunts them down. Before they can escape one of them starts to regress posing a hideous choice: kill their friends or be killed by them. Their only hope of survival is through a cave where Anja learns too late the meaning of the ancient rock art they came to study.
This is an Australian movie about a group of twenty somethings who go off in to the bushland of the Aussie outback in search of some ancient cave paintings in the area. While out there they come across a cave but one of them cuts themselves setting off an ancient legend. Then one of the group becomes sick and something takes over her body, making her turn in to some kind of blood lusting beast who rely's on the most primal of instincts, the need to feed.
