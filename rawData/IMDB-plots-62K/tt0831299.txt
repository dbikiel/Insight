'Every day is another day closer to the day I'll never have to do this again.' Five women, one restaurant, one night, one birthday, one breakdown. Then the phone rings. A famous actor is coming for dinner. I Really Hate My Job is the story of an evening in a caf√© in London's Soho. As in so many jobs, nothing much happens - except laughter, song, rage, collapse, intrigue, cooking, lying, nudity, conversation, secrets, love, friendship, ageing, hatred, rat-infestation and the arrival of a movie star. I Really Hate My Job. Who hasn't said it? A career. It's what happens when you lose control of a car on a wet road and it slams into a brick wall. You might assume they're just three waitresses, one cook and one dishwasher but they see themselves as an artist, an actor, a lover, an author and a philosopher.
