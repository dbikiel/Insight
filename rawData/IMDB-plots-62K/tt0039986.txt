When a nagging wife commits suicide, her husband is threatened with a murder frame by his lawyer, unless he kills a certain female reporter for him.
A reporter hears that a famous actress is dying in a hospital after being hit by a car. She goes to the hospital to interview the actress, who tells the reporter that her wealthy fiance, who was killed in an accident several years before, was actually murdered. Before long the reporter finds herself in a web of corruption, mental illness and murder.
