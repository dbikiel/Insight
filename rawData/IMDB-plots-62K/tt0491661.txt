A group of scientists try to stop a swarm of flesh-eating locusts that escape from a top secret government lab in the USA Midwest.
Entomologist Colt left the firm of his ex Vicky's dad Russ and his ruthless partner Gary, in order to regain his scientific independence and ethical virginity. After people are found on several founds with strange bite-marks, which turn out to be the work genetically miss-manipulated locusts, Colt teams up again with Vicky, who works for the public health authorities. After analyzing the facts, they join the heroic, possibly hopeless fight to stop the locust swarm spreading and endangering millions in most of Northern America.
