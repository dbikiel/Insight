Set in Ireland where the Catholic Church has been superseded by a repressive order with new ideas. When a group of Irish monks rebel, a Vatican official is sent to bring order once more.
When a group of traditional Irish priests (lamenting the decline and modernization of their religion) attempt to break away and establish their own movement, it is left to Martin Sheen (on a mission from Rome) to confront the group.
