Three friends head to the seafront for a drunken weekend, only to be imprisoned on the top floor of their holiday apartment by a malevolent paranormal force.
Three young people head to a remote holiday apartment complex, left vacant during the off-season, for a drunken weekend. They are Alice, her best friend Lizzy, and Lizzy's perverted, douchebag boyfriend Carl. There is not one redeeming quality to Carl. This is a man who can only get an erection from smelling his own excrement. He is a textbook bad cad sleazy enough to make perverted passes at Alice when Lizzy isn't looking, yet charming enough to remain inappropriately entertaining at party time. Things quickly take a turn for the worst. The group gets trapped in one of the high-floor apartments, unable to escape. No one knows they are there. They have no way to contact the outside world. Food and water grow scarce. Desperation sinks in. Is this all just a series of unfortunate events, or is there something supernatural behind it?
