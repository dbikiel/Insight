When Elena and Ethan go on vacation they asked Alex to look after their children but they are worried so they ask Maggie to make sure things remain OK.
Maggie and Alex have been butting heads since college when they were introduced by their best friends, Ethan and Elena. Now, their mutual pals are married with children, desperate for a romantic getaway and a babysitter. Uneasy about leaving the kids with the childish and seemingly irresponsible Alex, they know Maggie would be the mature choice. But with big things on the horizon for Maggies company, Ethan and Elena fear shes too busy. As a last minute solution, they decide to split the task, tricking Maggie and Alex into babysitting together and leaving town before they can object. Bound to their obligation, Alex and Maggie attempt to work through their differences, but their attempt at cooperating quickly turns into a stormy rivalry. However, opportunities to teach the children some life lessons bring the pair closer than ever, proving that they share some very similar ideals. Acting as a true family for the first time, both the babysitters and kids are sad to see their time together come to an end with the return of Ethan and Elena. But its the new-found bond between Maggie and Alex that makes them consider whether going their separate ways is what they truly want.
