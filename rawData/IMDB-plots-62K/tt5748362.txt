Brian Regan reinvigorates comedy with his new live stand-up special, "Live From Radio City Music Hall." He describes what it's like to work at IHOP, demonstrates the awkwardness of going to a new doctor and challenges the common notion that you shouldn't grocery shop when you're hungry. Anything could happen, so expect lots of Regan's signature high-energy social commentary.
