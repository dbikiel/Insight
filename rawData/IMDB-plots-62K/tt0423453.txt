Filmmakers Tricia Regan, David O. Russell and Juan Carlos Zaldivar interview dozens of people about the 2004 Iraq war, including soldiers, journalists, politicians, psycholgists, and even a two star general that led the Marines to victory in the first Gulf war. Soldiers Pay listens to people from all sides, and of varying opinions, giving a full picture of a morally ambiguous war which is exacting an enormous toll on our soldiers, on Iraq, and on America.
