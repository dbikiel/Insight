A beautiful but poor young girl finds all the money and material goods she never had when she becomes the girlfriend of a crime boss, but soon learns that there is a price to be paid for that kind of life.
Anna is quiet, living with her parents, cashiering at a caf√© bar in Bergamo. She meets and falls for Guido, a Milanese gangster in town to lie low. He pursues her, but also warns her that he's no good. She goes to Milan with him anyway. When she witnesses a Mob hit, Guido's boss wants her compromised so she will never testify against them: Guido pushes her into prostitution. When she becomes pregnant and Guido wants her to have an abortion, she rebels. Can she escape "the life," or is death the only alternative? What about the child?
