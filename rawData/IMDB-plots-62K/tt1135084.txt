(This synopsis may be too short. Please expand it.)A group of five exceptional bank robbers have been able to successfully rob several banks with such perfect execution that the police do not have a single clue to capture them. These criminals treat each robbery as a business plan that works. First, they plan each job with clockwork precision and are extremely careful in not leaving any evidence behind. Second, they fence the money to get it clean. Third, they all lay low for one year between jobs to not bring any attention to themselves. They decide to pull off one last heist that will be their biggest score, by taking out an armored-car. Their meticulous planning of robbing banks is thrown out the window, because of the short time frame to do the job, and the large amount of cash they will split. This may be the break the police have been waiting for, when this band of thieves finally makes a mistake. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy)
