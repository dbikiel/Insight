A college kid comes of age one summer amidst family conflict unleashed by the eventual passing of its patriarch.
Gathered one summer in a beautiful shoreline town, three generations are drawn together by their patriarch. With endearing moments of humor and uplifting spirit, Harvest is a portrait of a family awkwardly yet delicately hanging on to what was, what now is, and to one another.
