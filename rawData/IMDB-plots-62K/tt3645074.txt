After an actor finds a treasure map detailing the location of ancient gold hidden near a town in the Misiones province named after the 19th-century politician Leandro N. Alem, he persuades the producers to change the project, as a portrait of the radical Alem and move the production there - so he can search for the treasure. A portrait of a clash between a Swedish artist and an Argentinian director.
