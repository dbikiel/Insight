Based on the disturbing murder trial that gripped the nation, this Lifetime Original Movie tells the story of a seductive, aspiring photographer found guilty of killing her former lover.
Travis Alexander, a handsome liberal Mormon, is a successful 'motivational speaker'. In Las Vegas, his charm proves irresistible for local girl Jodi Arias, who seduces him by surprise. She follows him to his Arizona home, obsessed with becoming his wife. Called to order by his childhood buddy and the church community, Travis keeps pulling back, reminding he never promised a relationship, just sex for fun as agreed. Her absurd 'expectations' turn into stalking and ultimately lethal hatred when he dumps her for proper Mormon Katie.
