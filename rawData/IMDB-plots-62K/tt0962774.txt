A drama focused on a life-changing moment in 67-year-old train engineer Odd Horten's existence: the evening of his retirement.
A picaresque tale. Odd Horton is dependable and contained: he's a train engineer retiring after 40 years of service, living a simple life. His idea of adventure is to fly from one city in Norway to another. Starting on the night of his retirement dinner, Odd has a series of dislocating experiences: a boy insists that Odd sit by his bedside while he falls asleep; misadventure causes Odd to miss his last run; he witnesses an arrest; he assists an old man and makes a friend; he takes a trip with a blindfolded driver; he adopts a dog; he takes stock late one night at the roundhouse; he revisits his mother's disappointment in him. How should he live the rest of his life?
In Norway, the sixty-seven year-old train machinist Odd Horten retires after forty years of service. He receives a silver locomotive from his colleagues in a dinner party and loses his last trip. After the retirement, the plain Horten seems to be lost and wanders through Oslo, where he helps Trygve Sissener and they become friends. When Trygve invites him to take a ride in his car, the driver dies and Horten takes his dog Molly and his pair of skies. Horten has never worn a pair of skies and he tries for the first time. Later he travels with Molly and meets his old friend Svea.
