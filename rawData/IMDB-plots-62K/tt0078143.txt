Uuno Turhapuro, a useless bum who has married money, creates havoc around his father-in-law's presidential campaign. He dresses up as his long-lost, wealthy brother from America, but things go awry when the real brother appears. At some point Uuno takes up a job at a hardware store, only to warm up a classic TV sketch perfected years earlier by the film's writer-producer Spede Pasanen.
