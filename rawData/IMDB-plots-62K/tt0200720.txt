A woman risks losing her chance of happiness with the only man she has ever loved.
Terence Davies' The House of Mirth is a tragic love story set against a background of wealth and social hypocrisy in turn of the century New York. Lily Bart is a ravishing socialite at the height of her success who quickly discovers the precariousness of her position when her beauty and charm start attracting unwelcome interest and jealousy. Torn between her heart and her head, Lily always seems to do the right thing at the wrong time. She seeks a wealthy husband and in trying to conform to social expectations, she misses her chance for real love with Lawrence Selden.
New York, 1905. Lily Bart is a young, attractive woman, a socialite who knows how to go around in the high society. She has one problem though, she is financially dependent. Her only income is a small allowance her aunt Julia gives her. Her big secret is that she has gambling debts, so high that the problems can't be overseen. Her whole reputation is at stake. Marrying a rich man would mean the end of her problems, but nothing seems to work. She purposely sabotages a date with the wealthy, but dull Percy Gryce. She wants nothing from the advances of Jewish stock broker Sim Rosedale either. Only Lawrence Selden interests her, but he isn't rich and he knows that's why a marriage could never work. When good friend Gus Trenor, who wants an affair with Lily, squanders even more her of money on the stock market, Lily quickly loses her grip on life. Her only solution lies in a couple of private letters she bought, but revealing them will hurt the only man she has ever loved.
