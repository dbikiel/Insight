After killing two skinheads in a failed operation against NeoNazis, young undercover intelligence agent Daniel finds a hiding place and new friends in Berlins Turkish Arab community. Realistic and witty, Berlin filmmaker Cueneyt Kaya shows the rapprochement of two worlds which seem violently opposed. 'I always wanted to tell a story set in the Islamic culture in Germany from a realistic, critical and humorous perspective. Too often stories about Muslims and migrants are reduced to Taliban, headscarves, youth violence, and several other stereotypes. The world I grew up in, however, is entirely different. Its determined by family ties, caring for each other and the struggle you face if you want to maintain your identity as a Muslim of Turkish origin in Western society.' (Cueneyt Kaya)
