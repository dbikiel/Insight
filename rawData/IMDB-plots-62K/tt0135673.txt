Aunt Calliopi returns to Greece from Chicago after 30 years and plans to marry off her nieces.
A middle-aged man's conservative life is disturbed, when his sister returns to Greece, after many years in Chicago. Her arrival breaths new air to the family, and some extreme ideas of how to get her shy nieces to marry.
Disciplined, stern, and above all, old-fashioned, Charilaos Bardas--a retired general and one of the last old-school Athenian gentlemen--rules his family with an iron fist. With three daughters of marrying age, the good-hearted but autocratic paterfamilias has his work cut out for him; however, the timely arrival of Charilaos' widowed sister--the open-minded Greek expatriate in Chicago, Calliope Pappas--will soon bring about change and innovation. So, without delay, the resourceful problem-solver concocts an unusual but infallible plan to speed things up a bit, and before long, the first blissful niece walks down the aisle with her hand-picked husband. But, with such a clever strategy, will the good auntie from Chicago still remain single?
