A group of friends sneak into an abandoned prison with the intention of making a ghost hunting video, until they start to go missing one by one.
Bored to death, a group of nine audacious twentysomething friends led by the aspiring filmmaker, Hank, are talked into visiting the decayed Holmesburg Prison to record any paranormal activity in the abandoned institution. Intent on capturing raw emotions and undiluted reactions, the bold explorers of the supernatural sneak in the dark cells, only to realise that they bit off more than they could chew. Little by little, strange noises that chill the bone to the marrow, eerie happenings, and unaccountable disappearances begin to shed light on the thick mystery. Are the companions truly alone inside the deserted prison, or have they walked right into a deadly trap?
