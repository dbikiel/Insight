When his mother dies, a teenager takes a road-trip in a stolen car to find his long-lost brother. Along the way he discovers a profound connection with the car-owner and with himself as well.
In Eugene, Oregon, Mercer, 19, wants to tell his wayward half-brother, 18 years older than he, that their mother has died. He has an address in Shelter Cove, so he steals a car from a car wash and heads south. Nothing is simple: his brother is gone, but he left resentment Mercer has to deal with. He gets an address in Reno and stops in Fallon to hook up with a girl he knew in middle school. Reno's a bust, but she promises sex if Mercer will drive her and two friends to Mohave. His plans go awry. From time to time, the car's owner calls him on a cell phone left in the car. Her arch but friendly voice gives Mercer needed empathy. Will he ever find his brother, and if so, what then?
THE GO-GETTER is the story of Mercer White (Lou Taylor Pucci), a straight-arrow 19 year-old who steals a car and sets out to find his older half-brother he hasn't seen in fourteen years. It turns out to be quite the trip. He's barely out of town when a cell phone left behind in the stolen car begins to ring and Mercer finds himself talking to the car's owner, Kate (Zooey Deschanel). From this point forward, nothing proceeds as expected for Mercer. In Reno, hes seduced by a mysterious and sexy girl (played by Jena Malone) and has a slew of dangerous, humorous and eye-opening encounters. In the end its the wildness of the ride, the thrill of the pursuit and the discovery of a love he never saw coming that set this journey apart.
