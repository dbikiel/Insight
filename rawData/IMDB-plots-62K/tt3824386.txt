A story that takes place over millions of years and is inspired by the beauty of tropical islands and the allure of ocean volcanoes.
In the middle of the Pacific Ocean, a solitary volcanic island, Uku, longs for love and a companion to share his sentimental and sweet song. Surrounded by creatures great and small, for eons, the lonely volcano has been waiting patiently for his true mate, however, is anyone listening to Uku's beautiful melody? He's finally about to find out.
This Pixar short opens with a scene of a giant, male volcano in a Hawaiian bay. The music and song began. this sad volcano watches two sea turtles and other pairs in love and wishes for someone too. Then he looks to the sky and sing" I have a dream I hope it will come true that you're here with me and I'm here with you. I wish that the earth, sea and the sky up above-a will send me someone to lava", as he envisions two volcanoes together in the clouds.
As the story goes on he loses hope and lave. He is shown drying up and sinking into the sea. Then far below him is a female volcano who has been listening to his song. She emerges from the depths of the sea but can't find him. So she sings his song and his lava returns and he comes back above the sea. They sing a new song as they hold each other forever. "I have a dream I hope it will come true" She:"That you'll grow old with me" He: "And I'll grow old with you" Both: "We thank the earth, sea and the sky we thank too
I lava you.
I lava you.
I lava you."
