A gangster deputes two of his men to recover money from an out of town compulsive gambler.
99 is an original story inspired by real events - well, very liberally inspired - it is more fiction than fact. It is the story of two men in two cities, who are bound by a common feeling of always being stuck at '99'. They never seem to make it to a 'century' - in life. It is an unpredictable and hilarious ride spread over two cities with colorful characters, unbelievable circumstances, small-time crooks, big-time conspiracies, fateful car crashes, a briefcase full of money... and a historical controversy brewing in the background!
