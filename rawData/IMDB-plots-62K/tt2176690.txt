A story centered around a group of self-destructive skateboarders in Paris.
A group of skateboarders in Paris are at the heart of a loose coalition of young people who do drugs and have sex. Several of them are rent boys, including the Dorian Gray/Narcissus of the group Math (Lukas Ionesco) and his friend JP (Hugo Behar-Thinieres) who is in love with him, but is continually rejected because Math reckons he's only gay for pay. There's a girl who sometimes comes over and is jealous of JP's closeness to Math, and so she snitches on JP to his parents, and there's an indigent old man nicknamed Rockstar (Larry Clark) whom the group tolerate as a kind of mascot/despised pet. And there's Michael Pitt (who featured in Clark's "Bully") with a guitar in a couple of scenes looking slightly uncomfortable at being so clearly surplus to requirements.
