Post apocalyptic Frankenstein-ish fantasy
In a post apocalyptic world where technology is outlawed, Walter, a reclusive scientist, secretly creates a self-aware android, "Puzzlehead". Jealously erupts when Puzzlehead wins the affection of Julia, the beautiful shopgirl that Walter has longed for. The resulting Sci-Fi love triangle is a Frankensteinian fable that traps all three in a web of deception and the ultimate betrayal.
