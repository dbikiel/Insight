Ivan (Brian Jordan Alvarez) is an American painter residing in Colombia. He is visited by his best friend, Christian (Peter Vack), along with his younger brother, Cole (Morgan Krantz). Somewhere along the way, Ivan and Cole hit it off although Cole is not gay (so he says). Will older brother Christian be okay with that? As they say, True Love Conquers All, even if it takes years.
