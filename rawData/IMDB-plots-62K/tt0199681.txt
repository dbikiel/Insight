Kiba is caught in the intrigue between a crooked goldmine owner, a cynical, betrayed swordsman, a manipulative lady and an arrogant dojo master.
The second and final installment in Gosha's Samurai Wolf carries on many on the hallmarks as the original: the same freeze-frame battle cry opening montage, the same awesome harmonica theme music, another title sequence in which Kiba is enjoying a snack. Kiba's trademark scissors are once again employed as a key plot device, and Kiba continues to demonstrate his honesty and honor in a corrupt and dirty world.
