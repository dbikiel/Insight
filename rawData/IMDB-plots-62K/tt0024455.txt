A stay-at-home husband and his businesswoman wife plan separate vacations, but he doesn't go fishing. He masquerades as a barber on her pleasure cruise.
A house husband (way before his time) stows away on the pleasure cruise he practically dares his successful businesswoman wife to go on. Going undercover as a barber, he subverts each flirtation she coyly entertains as she scratches her head about why each potential extra-marital suitor opts out. Meanwhile, he's being pursued by another woman who's looking for amusement and adventure in this pre-code movie that seems saucy, yet coy.
