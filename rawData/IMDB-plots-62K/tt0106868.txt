When a gang of African poachers raid her family's farm, young Nonni, visiting American teenager Harry Winslow and a local bushman guide must escape into the Kalahari desert and reach the nearest town.
The witty Nonni and the stuck-up city-boy Harry are the only ones to survive a massacre of a gang of poachers among the gamekeeper's family on his lonesome farm in the savanna. Now the ruthless murderers are after them as the only witnesses. Without a means of transportation, the only way to escape is to walk through two thousand kilometers of Kalahari desert with the help of the African bushman Xhabbo. On the months-long journey ahead, they not only become good friends against their differences, but also realize that every one of them has strength and skills that are required to survive.
