Secret Agent Leonard Parker (Bill Cosby) is called out of retirement to save the world from evil genius Medusa Johnson (Gloria Foster).
The C.I.A. asks for ex-spy Leonard Parker's (Bill Cosby's) help in stopping evil genius Medusa Johnson (Gloria Foster), who is brainwashing small animals into killing people. Leonard, however, has his own problems to deal with: winning back his ex-wife.
After separating from his wife, Leonard Parker (Bill Cosby) quit the spy business and became a restaurateur. His wife refuses to speak with him, and his daughter, who changes her career more often than her clothes, has begun dating a man old enough to be Leonard's father. On top of it all, the government has asked him to come back and save the world again. The evil Medusa Johnson (Gloria Foster) has hypnotized animals into doing her bidding, and plans to use them to take over the world. It's up to Leonard to save the world, as only he can battle her vegetarians and man-eating rabbits.
