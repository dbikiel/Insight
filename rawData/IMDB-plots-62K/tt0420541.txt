A Tibetan-Canadian returns to her homeland to smuggle a secret message from the Dalai Lama and to document the occupation and cultural genocide of Tibet by China.
This bold documentary follows a young Tibetan refugee in Quebec as she returns to her native land carrying a video message by the Dalai Lama. Tibetan families gather around, transfixed by the images of the leader who since 1950 has been trying to obtain permission from the Chinese authorities to return to his homeland and his people.
