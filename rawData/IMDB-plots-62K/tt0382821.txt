Well, apparently Wu Fang (Wei Zhao) is a young lady on a mission. Namely, to go on as many dates as quickly as possible, not to drink as much tea as possible, but to find the man of her dreams. Then there is her latest blind date, one Chen Mingliang (Wen Jiang), who is on a rebound and meeting Miss Wu. Will this one work out? After all, they seem to be opposites in so many ways.
