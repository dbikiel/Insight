On the run from the police and a female roller derby team, scam artist Michael Rangeloff steals a coffin and boards a train, pretending to be a soldier bringing home a dead war buddy. The train ride turns into far more than Michael bargains for.
A stolen fortune hidden in a coffin aboard a coast to coast train is at stake. A con-man, his protege, and a foul mouthed actress try to get their hands on the money, but standing in their way is a thief, a senile railroad conductor who is in contact with Richard Nixon, a confused FBI agent, an Army deserter, and an attack dog.
