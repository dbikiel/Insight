In the Fiji islands, the greedy and unscrupulous owner of the Valalola Resort Primal Park invites investors and guests for an opening party of his compound composed of hotel and zoo aiming to find partners for his discoveries. When a bunch of college smalltime thieves puts a virus in the security system to participate in a scavenger hunt, the greatest attractions of the zoo - sabretoothes from the prehistoric age developed from DNA found in fossils - escape, killing the hosts and guards for fun.
As the owner of the revolutionary and state-of-the-art Valalola Park, Niles (Nicholas Bell) knows he has a surefire winner. The island is home to a genetic theme park where scientists are cloning extinct beasts. Just as Niles welcomes a small group of college students on a scavenger hunt to the island, his security team assures him that a recurring power malfunction on the island is of no concern. As the power goes out from cage to cage across the island, a mutant sabretooth tiger escapes. The cat begins to devour everything in its path, turning a peaceful resort trip into a race for survival.
