At the beginning of the 20th century, there's no Poland. Russia occupies Warsaw. Herling, a fearless provocateur, is captured when a bomb he sets off kills two children. Although he's racked by guilt, he manages to escape with a young prisoner, Adam. They reach Adam's home in Austrian-occupied Zakopane. Herling is taken in by Adam's friends, Andrzej Woyda and Marta Moraczewska. Sexual as well as political tensions arise. The men compete and feed their love of danger by rock climbing. A tragic accident is followed by Herling's receiving orders to kill again. How he resolves his feelings about Andrzej and Marta, staying true to the revolution, ends the film.
