Marc Guermont used to be a very much sought after horse stuntman in films. One day unfortunately, he had a bad fall from his mount during the shooting of a historical movie. And not only has he become a paraplegic but his insurance company tries to rip him off into the bargain. Two good reasons for Marc to feel bitter and enraged. Needless to say that Marc resolutely waits for the coming of his insurance "advisor". But when the latter reports to him, the insurance man happens to be a... seductive woman, Florence Kernel.
