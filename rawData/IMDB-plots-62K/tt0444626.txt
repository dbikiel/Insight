The story of John McCain's experience as a Vietnam War POW. Based on the memoir of the same title.
John McCain is a poor student, except at wrestling, but toughs it out in Annapolis at the US Naval Academy with the goal of becoming a career naval officer like his father and grandfather, who were both admirals. Love at first sight leads to a marriage and children with Carole. During the Vietnam War, he's shot down and captured by the Vietcong, who torture American POWs. He resists years of torture and misery, only breaking once due to his busted limbs, and eventually returning home after five and one half years in captivity.
