When Mrs. Call's heart condition acts up, Tammy tags along in the trip to Los Angeles when the old lady is getting her surgery. Since there are no guest quarters in the hospital, Tammy gets a job in the hospital as a nurse's assistant. Peter Fonda plays Tammy's love interest, Dr. Mark Cheswick, while Adam West has a small part as Dr. Eric Hassler. This is the final entry in the canonic film series, and Sandra Dee's last appearance as Tammy.
