Inga (Academy award winner Marcia Gay Harden) is a poet. She wants to buy and restore a house she is drawn to that reminds her of her childhood home, but her distant husband Hermann (Michael Gaston) sees little value in it or many of the things Inga loves. Inga realizes that many things in her life are coming full circle.
