The Jennings' fight for their daughters life after she is kidnapped by an experienced gang of thieves.
When their daughter is abducted and taken for ransom by a gang of serial kidnappers, a young doctor and his wife find themselves held hostage while a 24-hour plan to extort their money is set into motion. Now, with time running out and the health of their asthmatic daughter at serious risk, they find themselves in a life-and-death race against the clock as the "perfect crime" begins spiraling towards an unthinkable, terrifying and deadly conclusion.
Four times already, criminal mastermind Hickey and his lover Cheryl have abducted a rich doctor's child, guarded by dumb dogsbody Marvin, and smoothly collected ransom within 24 hours without any fuss. Now it's to be brilliant medical inventor Will Jennings's daughter Abby's turn. But when mother Karen points out the child needs asthma medication and Will uses his skills on Cheryl, the smooth script degenerates into panic improvisation, dangerous for all.
