Two inseparable, hormonal, English BFF teen boys, avoided by all others, head to Ibiza with Kevin's parents. Will they lose their virginity there?
Kevin and Perry are two 15-year-old boys whose desperation to lose their virginity is so great that it inspires a sort of awe. In the rare moments when they're not thinking about girls, Kevin dreams of being a singer and Perry aspires to be a dance-music DJ. When they manage to stop a bank robbery, they're given a sizable cash reward and decide to go on holiday to Ibiza, which is supposedly populated with thousands of beautiful women willing to sleep with anyone. Bu after the boys pack plenty of condoms and sunscreen, Kevin's parents announce that they're tagging along. Undeterred, Kevin and Perry make the trip and meet superstar DJ Eyeball Paul , who may or may not listen to their demo tape. The boys also encounter Gemma and Candice, two scruffy teenage girls who are nearly as eager as Kevin and Perry to get horizontal.
A movie spin-off from Harry Enfield's TV series, featuring the popular character of Kevin the Teenager. When stubborn, spotty Kevin and his equally-hopeless best friend Perry go on holiday to the party island Ibiza, they see it as their big chance to become superstar club DJs and, more importantly, to lose their virginities. But they aren't prepared for the interference of top DJ Eyeball Paul, not to mention the embarrassment factor of Kevin's long-suffering parents.
