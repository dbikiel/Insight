Michael Jenkins' movie "The Heartbreak Kid" centres on the coming of age relationship between a teacher (Claudia Karvin), and a wild and spirited student (Alex Demitrides). The teacher , Christiana jolts the young man, Nicks sexuality beyond belief. This story is centred in the Australian-Greek life upbringing which Nick is shown the truth about street life. Christiana is locked into traditions of how women are restricted into Greek traditions of women in the work place. Also how she commits herself into destined life of marriage with children which leaves her living across the street with her mom and dad.
