A Girl, Maryam, is attacked with Acid by Pasha, a young man who is madly in love with her.
Pasha is the mastermind of a street gang that has moved from simple purse snatchings and muggings to car theft, kidnapping and extortion. His backstory is divulged at length and from contradictory points of view: Some say that he's a Robin Hood of sorts who only preys on the corrupt rich and uses his haul to help orphans, while others call him scum. From the standpoint of his fellow gang member Baroon ("I'm Not Angry" co-star Baran Kosari, thrilling here as a bad girl with incredibly alluring eyes), he's a sensitive man who cries when he kills someone.
Lantouri is the name of a gang of thieves and blackmailers in Tehran. Pasha, a member of the gang, falls in love with Maryam, a social activist/journalist who has started a campaign, 'No to Violence' and she tries to convince the families of the crime victims, to forgive the murderers of their loved ones. Maryam rejects Pasha's love, feeling humiliated Pasha decides to take revenge upon Maryam and does irreparable harm to her. Maryam will now have to choose to forgive or seek 'Qesas' (revenge) and request 'eye for eye' punishment according to the Islamic Punitive Laws.
