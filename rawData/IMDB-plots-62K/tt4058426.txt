The life and death of Jyoti Singh, an Indian medical student whose violation and murder by gang rapists exposed the violent misogyny of Indian society.
INDIA's DAUGHTER is the story of the short life, and brutal gang rape and murder in Delhi in December 2012 of an exceptional and inspiring young woman. The rape of the 23 year old medical student by 6 men on a moving bus, and her death, sparked unprecedented protests and riots throughout India and led to the first glimmers of a change of mindset. Interwoven into the story line are the lives, values and mindsets of the rapists whom the film makers have had exclusive and unprecedented access to interview before they hang. The film examines the society and values which spawn such violent acts, and makes an optimistic and impassioned plea for change.
This documentary film pays tribute to the remarkable and inspiring short life of Jyoti Singh and documents the brutality of her gang-rape and murder in Delhi in December 2012. It also examines the mindset of the men who committed the rape, and - perhaps most importantly - it sets these specifics against a wider in-depth exploration of the patriarchal society and culture which not only seeds but may be said even to encourage violence against women. The focus of the film's exploration is on the compelling human stories behind the incident in the context of a world in which brutality against women is so commonplace. Ultimately, the film is optimistic - the case has been a catalyst for change, and the massive public response to the incident bears witness to an attitudinal change on the horizon, which the film seeks to amplify.
