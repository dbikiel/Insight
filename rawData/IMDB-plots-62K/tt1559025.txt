When a gunman killed five Amish children and injured five others in a Nickel Mines, Pennsylvania schoolhouse shooting in October of 2006, the world media attention rapidly turned from the tragic events to the extraordinary forgiveness demonstrated by the Amish community. Through the eyes of a grieving mother, Ida Graber, and other devastated families, this movie explores the Amish's astonishing reaction to the horrific shootings - of forgiveness and compassion.
A grieving Amish mother struggles to forgive the woman whose husband killed her daughter and four other schoolchildren in this movie inspired by the true-life events that unfolded in a Nickel Mines schoolhouse on October 2, 2006. After the shooting, the media descended upon Nickel Mines, and the parents of the murdered schoolchildren remained steadfast in their promise to practice forgiveness -- except for Ida Graber (Kimberly Williams-Paisley). Devastated by the loss of her daughter, Ida found herself unable to forgive the gunman and his wife, Amy Roberts (Tammy Blanchard). With each passing day Ida's sorrow continues to fester, testing her faith in ways that she, and many others in her community, never dreamt of.
