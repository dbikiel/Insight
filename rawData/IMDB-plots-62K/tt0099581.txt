In 1989, clean-cut FBI man John Buckner is detailed to escort heavily-bearded Huey Walker back to jail for offenses dating back to his days as a celebrated hippie radical. After Walker dupes Buckner on the train he falls into the hands of a couple of well-meaning refugees from the 60's, the two men with apparently nothing in common find themselves on the run together. But appearances can be deceptive.
The young FBI agent John Buckner is instructed to bring Huey Walker, a hippie from the sixties, to prison. They travel by train, and of course, Huey tries to escape. John loses his freedom and his identity through one of Huey's tricks: He plies him with drink and takes his gun, his handcuffs and his passport. Now John ends up in jail instead of Huey... When the mistake is discovered, John sets off in pursuit of Huey.
