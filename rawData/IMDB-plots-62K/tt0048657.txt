Proud and independent, Stella, an unconventional Rebetico singer who cherishes her freedom, finds herself in an intense whirlwind romance. Everything points to a tragic ending, and in the aftermath of passion, there can be no winners.
The story of a young, wild woman who doesn't want to compromise and settle down. Stella is a restless, rebellious Greek woman who plays with men and enjoys her life as much as she can. But when she meets a young football player, things get mixed up. She loves him but she loves her freedom too. So it's about time she made an important choice.
Fiercely proud and unapologetically independent, Stella--the blonde Rebetico diva and flamboyant entertainer of the small night-club named Paradise--above all, is a woman who cherishes her freedom. Choosing to give in to desire without ever committing herself to one man, the feisty vocalist stays true to her ideals; however, a fateful encounter with the explosive and egotistic football player, Miltos, will pave the way for an unexpected and all-consuming whirlwind romance. Up until now, no one has ever managed to control Stella and rob her of her precious autonomy; nevertheless, Miltos is the inadvertent catalyst in an already volatile relationship, and he demands total surrender. Undoubtedly, love is grand but it can be dangerous--and as everything points to a tragic ending--only a paradoxical act of carnivorous devotion can provide catharsis. And in the aftermath of passion, there can be no winners.
