Dr. Shukri Mokhtar is a renowned social psychology specialist who decides to give one last lecture before his departure from the world. Best known for his ability to answer the simplest questions, Dr. Mokhtar in his last lecture answers the very simple question: "how do we love?". He gives a full description of the different stages of love by recounting four different love stories going through curves and various crises. Although the four stories do not seem to be connected, they share one essential element that connects them all to each others and even to the seemingly sick lecturer.
