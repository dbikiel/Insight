Blondie takes over Dagwood's job while he goes off on a fishing trip.
Dagwood Bumstead quits his job when his long-awaited vacation is postponed. Blondie asks J.C. Dithers to give Dagwood his job back, and Dithers agrees but on the condition that Blondie take charge of the office while he is in Washington closing a deal. Dagwood, left to tend the house while Blondie goes to work, succumbs to a neighbor's suggestion to go fishing and leaves Baby Dumpling in care of Blondie's sister, Dot, in town for a jitterbug contest. While fishing, Dagwood meets two entertainers from the Garden Cafe and when one of them, Francine, almost overturns the boat, Dagwood grabs to save her, and the "glutch" is photographed. Blondie has the film from Dagwood's camera developed, and Dithers wires her to buy some land owned by the Garden Club proprietor before he learns that it has been approved as the site of the new airport. Enroute, she picks up the developed film. Dagwood has wandered off to play pool, and Dot and her boy friend, Freddie, take Baby Dumpling with them to the jitterbug contest at the Garden Cafe. Blondie recognizes Francine from the fishing photograph just as Dagwood comes along in pursuit of Baby Dumpling. She smacks him with her purse, then leaves with Baby Dumpling. The caf√© owner finds the Dithers telegram realizes the importance of his land. Meanwhile, reeling from the impact of Blondie's blow, wins the jitterbug contest with his wild gyrations.
