What makes a woman swipe right for Mr. Wrong? Sof√≠a Vergara and Whitney Cummings star in this fresh, witty look at the science behind our romantic missteps.
What makes a woman swipe right for Mr. Wrong and left for Mr. Right? This is a look at the real-life science behind our (often regrettable) romantic impulses. Writer-director Whitney Cummings (2 Broke Girls) stars as no-nonsense neuroscientist Julia, whose research into the biochemistry of the female brain is illustrated by three couples: newlyweds Zoe (Cecily Strong) and Greg (Blake Griffin), whose career troubles seep into their relationship; Lisa (Sofia Vergara) and Steven (Deon Cole), who are looking to spice up their stuck-in-a-rut marriage; and Lexi (Lucy Punch) who can't help trying to change her boyfriend Adam (James Marsden). Meanwhile, the straight-laced Julia's own synapses start to fire when a handsome new subject (Toby Kebbell) joins her study.
