May is waiting for her boyfriend in a run-down American motel, when an old flame turns up and threatens to undermine her efforts and drag her back into the life that she was running away from. The situation soon turns complicated.
May is hiding out at an old motel in the Southwest. Eddie, his half-brother, also an old flame shows up. He threatens her metaphorically and, at times, literally drag her back into the life she had fled from. The film focuses on the couple's fluctuating past and present relationships, and the dark secrets hidden within, including one from an old man who lives near the motel (Harry Dean Stanton).
