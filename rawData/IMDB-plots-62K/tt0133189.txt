In the early 1980s Stevo and Heroin Bob are the only two dedicated punks in conservative Salt Lake City.
Two punks live in Salt Lake City. The film covers their all-day routine. The realism of the character-narrated movie may be discussed. One of the punks gets ill, stays in hospital for three weeks, comes out again. Three parties are covered and one concert including a fight between punks, rednecks and others.
Steve-O and Heroin Bob are 2 average, typical anarchist punks you would see all over NYC or the UK in the early/mid 80's. The only problem is they live in the most religiously oppressive place in America, Salt Lake City, Utah, so they are looked at and treated like aliens or devil worshippers by all the local "rednecks". In the fall of 85', after graduating college, they've decided the only way to rebel against the system is to do nothing, to waste their educated minds and keep the party going. But with his dad hounding him to go to Harvard Law, Heroin Bob getting a girlfriend, and a growing doubt in his belief system, Steve-O can't help but feel that the good times may be over and it's time to move on. But moving on may be proving the one thing he's not ready to know, he might just be a poser after all.
SLC Punk is a film about a couple of kids who become sick of their dull, ordinary life. They make plans to try to change things and create anarchy.
