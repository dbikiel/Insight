An exploration of the lives of several former adult performers who have retired from the porn industry.
After Porn Ends is a documentary that not only examines the lives and careers of some of the biggest names in the history of the adult entertainment industry but what happens to them after they leave the business and try and live the "normal" lives that millions of other Americans enjoy. They hailed from the rural South, steel towns, and the San Fernando Valley. As teenagers and young adults, none of them thought that porn was in their future. They were artists, baseball players, child prodigies, and even Ivy Leaguers. Now, after their lives in porn, they're TV stars, bounty hunters, writers, and social activists. What happened in between? And, now that they've moved on, can they really live a normal life after porn?
