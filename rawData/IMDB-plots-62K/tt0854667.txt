Two aliens who crash on Earth must find a buried weapon that will destroy the planet and their own society if not stopped.
When two aliens fighting against each other in their spacecrafts crash on Earth at Area 51, a military group goes to the location but they are killed. The former military Jake Townsend seeks news from his brother in the base where his brother serves, and stumbles with the alien Jude. He is wounded and explains that he needs to find a weapon before the other alien, Kronnan, activates it to destroy Earth. They team-up with Jake's former girlfriend Monica Gray to search the weapon while they are hunted down by Kronnan and a paramilitary team. But when Jake meets Kronnan, he tells that Jude is the one who intends to activate the destructive weapon. Who is telling the truth?
