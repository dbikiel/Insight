A young militia is all that stands between a coming dead horde and their rural town decimated by the fracking industry.
The rural town of Elwood is a "bubble" against the backdrop of a suspected global infection that appears connected to natural gas fracking. A small band of young adults under the training of ex-military soldier Seiler (Billy Zane)keeps the town safe while patrolling the fence line that locks the residents inside. There is something wrong with the town, with more dread and fear penned up inside than what awaits on the frontier. Young Ian Sommers realizes he needs to get free, no matter what lies beyond Elwood's fence and tries to convince others to do the same.
