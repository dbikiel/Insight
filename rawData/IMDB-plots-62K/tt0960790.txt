Rainbow press reporter Ludo is sentenced to 8 months, but is released on probation. But he has to work 300 hours for a local daycare center and meets Anna who has unfinished business with him.
Gossip-columnist Ludo finds himself sentenced to three-hundred hours of community service after he literally crashes a private celebrity party. The work is at a children's day-centre and while the job's fine it is his bad luck that the person in charge is a woman whom he used to play endless practical jokes on when they were at school; she hasn't forgotten and is prepared to use her new-found power to get her own back. She finds however that, like the children, she's warming to him. If only the court injunction had stopped his womanising too.
Der Boulevard ist sein Revier: Reporter Ludo (Til Schweiger) ist mit Paparazzo
Moritz (Matthias Schweighöfer) ständig auf der Jagd nach Stars,
Starlets und Boxenludern. Manchmal glaubt er sogar selbst an die Storys,
die er verzapft und eines Tages geht das ins Auge: Die Richterin brummt
ihm 300 soziale Arbeitsstunden in einem Kinderhort auf. Dort herrscht
Anna (Nora Tschirner), die den Schwerenöter Ludo schon als Kind nicht
ausstehen konnte. Ludo muss also barfuß durch die Hölle. Zwischen
Klatschspalten und Klettergerüsten entdeckt er sich selbst es ist der
Knüller seines Lebens.The street is his beat: with his fellow paparazzi Moritz (Matthias Schweighöfer), reporter Ludo (Til Schweiger) is always on the lookout for stars, starlets, &amp; harlots. Sometimes, he even believes the storys he types, and one day, he gets what he deserves: the court orders him to spend 300 hours in public service at a nursurey school. Anna (Nora Tschirner) is in charge there - a woman the womanizing Ludo couldn't stand as a child - and working for her is like walking through Hell barefoot. Between gossip columns &amp; scaffolding, he learns this is the scoop of his life.
