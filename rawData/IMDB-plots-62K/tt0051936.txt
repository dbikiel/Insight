During the early 1900s, a runaway Missouri orphan reaches a town where the townsfolk are enchanted with him and where a wealthy rancher and a local newspaperman compete to give him an education.
A runaway orphan, Biarn Turner (De Wilde), attempts to escape his troubles by traveling to Florida during the early 1900's. He finds his way to a small town where the local newspaper editor, Doyle Magee (Merrill), decides to take the boy in and give him a chance at a regular life. Wealthy local farmer, Tobias Brown (Marvin), also takes an interest in Biarn's future, but he treats the young man harshly, masking Tobias' real hidden feelings of affection and genuine concern. Biarn's mannerisms and willingness to help others, quickly wins the favor of the local townsfolk; And he also proves his worth by preparing a seemingly untrainable horse for a race that the town will hold during their annual 4th of July celebration.
Intent on going to sunny turn-of-the-century Florida, the polite sixteen-year-old runaway orphan, Biarn Turner, sets out on foot on a long journey, only to find not one, but two father figures. In the small town of Delphi, the gruff and affluent landowner, Tobias Brown, is willing to take Biarn under his wing and teach him the hard lessons of life--while, on the other hand--the kind and generous newspaper editor, Doyle Magee, is also interested in taking in the boy. As the grand 4th of July celebration approaches, two polar opposites and the entire city's compassionate inhabitants want to help Biarn become a man, against the backdrop of enthusiastic preparations for the fascinating annual horse-trotting race. Is innocent Biarn destined to fulfil his dream in Missouri's quiet little city?
