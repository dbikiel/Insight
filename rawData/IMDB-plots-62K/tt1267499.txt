A Prague weatherman gets a bad case of the seven-year itch.
The movie's main hero is Oskar (Jirí Machácek), a TV weatherman. Like many forty-somethings, Oskar tries to ward off his mid-life crisis and his increasingly dissatisfying marriage with a steady stream of affairs. When he manipulates a weather report for the sake of flirting, the repercussions are quick to follow: Oskar finds himself jobless and wifeless. His carefree bachelor lifestyle, interlaced with lovers of varying ages, is not, however, idyllic.
