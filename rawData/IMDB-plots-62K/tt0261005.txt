The film is set in 1913 Russia during the celebrations of the Tricentennial Anniversary of the Romanov Dynasty (1613 - 1913). Rich Russian merchants are celebrating their wealth by gambling and playing poker. They are traveling aboard the luxurious cruise liner "St. Nikolai" on Volga river, oblivious to the fact that several gangs of crooks and con-artists are stealing their money in the game. Their target is the wealthiest Russian tycoon Satanovsky.
