Garfield, Jon, and Odie head out into the great outdoors.
Garfield is taken on a camping trip by Jon, much against his will. A series of very funny disasters follow. But not all is well, as a panther has escaped from the local zoo and is stalking them. Will our hero survive to eat another lasagna and kick Odie off the table again?
