20 years after meddling into the bank heist of a notorious robber named Gasback, Vash the Stampede is heading towards Macca City. Rumors say that the legendary thief might appear there causing an enormous influx of bounty hunters in the area who want to collect the $300,000,000 prize for his head.
Vash the Stampede, a gunfighter with a giant bounty on his head, always wearing his favorite red-colored trench coat, is back. Scary as it may sound, he is actually a very nice guy that values life a lot. Twenty years ago, Vash saves Gasback, who is the world's number 1 wanted criminal. Almost. However, twenty years later he finds himself in a town, where, for some reason, many bounty hunters are gathered. Among them, there is also a young lady, who wants to kill Gasback really badly. Why does Vash try to save Gasback's life?
