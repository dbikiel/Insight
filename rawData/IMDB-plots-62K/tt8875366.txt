Studying in Hong Kong but living in Shenzhen (the port city of Mainland China), Peipei has spent 16 years in her life travelling between these two cities. To realize the dream of seeing snow in Japan with her bestie, Peipei joins a smuggling gang and uses her student identity to smuggle iPhones from Hong Kong to Mainland. Her family life and friendships begin to fall apart. The daily life of Peipei starts to get out of control.
Sixteen-year-old Peipei crosses the border nearly every day, travelling from her mainland China home to her Hong Kong high school and back again. Customs officials glimpse her school uniform and innocent face and wave her through without a second thought. But Peipei is about to become involved in some illicit activities that will render her routine into something highly dangerous. Peipei's father works the night shift at a shipping yard while her mother fritters away the family's earnings at late-night mahjong parties. Eager to please her best friend, a wealthy girl making plans for the two of them to spend Christmas holidays at a Japanese hot spring, Peipei is desperate to raise some cash. Her attempt to earn money waitressing yields unimpressive results. But once she crosses paths with the handsome young Hao and his band of smartphone smugglers, an alluring windfall suddenly seems feasible.
