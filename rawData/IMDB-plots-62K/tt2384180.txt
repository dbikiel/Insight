Set in the future, a rocket ship from Earth travels to a far universe and touches down on an unknown planet with a mission to exploit its natural resources. However, this is planet is like no other, it seems to be alive.
Set in an indeterminate future where the natural resources of all local solar systems in the proximity of Earth have been consumed. Rocket ships are sent to unexplored 'far universes' to find 'virgin' planets to exploit. One of these ships touches down on 'Planet Seven of Star System Eighty-Four' and the astronauts quickly discover this is a planet like no other, one that not only seems to be sentient in some mysterious way, but is capable of manifesting anything the individual crew member desires. All but one of the astronauts is utterly enchanted by the planet and an argument quickly erupts out over the nature of their mission, one which has deadly consequences for the entire crew.
Future. The distant "7th planet of the 84th star system." "Planet Hunters" landed on it - earthlings searching for minerals, plying space on ships whose speed is "equal to the speed of God." The planet turns out to be of the terrestrial type, with an excellent climate, atmosphere, flora and fauna. One of the crew members, Chatterton, having caught an insect, says: "Yes, and tigers can be found here ..." The crew, consisting of four people and a dog, begins to get acquainted with the planet.
