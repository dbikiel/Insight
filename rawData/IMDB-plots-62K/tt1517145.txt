During the Korean War, small mountain village is evacuated as retreating American GIs approach.
In a small mountain community a group of people, included young families, live they're normal life in the beginning of the Korean War. People try to be calm and live they're life as normal as can be, knowing that the communist North is approaching. One day the US army comes into they're small village, and tell them to evacuate they're homes at once. On the run through the mountain side of Korea they once again approach the US army who order them to sit down on the ground, and then the real tragedy starts.
