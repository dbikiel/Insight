An amateur sleuth attending a prestigious girls' boarding school helps the police and her friends identify a serial killer who is targeting the students and teachers.
The corpses are piling up at St. Hilda's School for Girls, leaving top cop Michael Rennie with more than the usual suspects. Is the killer Mark Damon? Peeping Tom Luciano Pigozzi? Or someone else? Mario Bava's original script "Cry Nightmare" was entrusted to director Antonio Margheriti. Be sure to see the Italian version which runs 98 mins. (the film was hacked by 15 minutes and retitled by American International Pictures to show mainly at drive-ins).
