A geneticist takes his assistants to his old family home to locate the deadly product of his late mother's revolutionary research into rapid human evolution - his monstrous tentacled baby brother - before a mad scientist gets to him first.
Amanda's deathbed request to her son, John, was for him to destroy all the lab notes etc. from her last experiment. She also blurts out he had a brother. At the funeral John meets Melissa, who claims to be his mothers biggest fan. Together with some of John's friends they go to Amanda's house, but none are prepared for what they find there.
