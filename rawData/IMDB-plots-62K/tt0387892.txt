Claire (Nymark), an unmarried pregnant teenager, finds an odd relation in Madame MÃ©likian (Ascaride), an older woman grieving over the death of her son.
When Claire learns that she is five months pregnant at the tender age of 17, she decides to give birth anonymously. She finds refuge with Madame Melikian, an embroiderer for haute couture designers. And, day by day, stitch by stitch, as Claire's belly grows rounder, the threads of embroidery create a filial bond between them.
