An upper-class female reporter is (despite herself) attracted to a hulking laborer digging a tunnel under the Hudson River.
Sandhog Jim Ryan is suspended from his job helping to dig a tunnel beneath a river because of an incident while being photographed for a story by Katherine Grant. Feeling responsible, Katherine hires Ryan to assist her during his suspension. She is elegant and sophisticated, while he is outspoken and down-to-earth. This combination leads to conflicts, and ultimately romance.
