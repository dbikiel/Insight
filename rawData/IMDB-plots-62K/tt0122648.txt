The story of Piero from childhood to fatherhood, over the background of Livorno's neighborhood Ovosodo.
Story of young and shy Piero growing up in a popular area of Livorno (Leghorn) that has the same name as Piero's nickname ("Ovosodo" - "Boiled egg") from his childhood until marriage and coming of age. Mostly a story about all the people that changed his life: Giovanna, the teacher that pushes him to study, his best friend Tommaso, his great love Lisa who will definitively sail away. It's also a story about all the disillusions and compromises in finding one's place in life.
