A woman is falsely accused of a crime.
Ellen Plainview, a sweet, caring, working wife and mother, answers the door one afternoon to learn that she is under arrest for attempted murder. She enters a legal nightmare as the evidence against her accumulates until it is overwhelming. Her friends and even her policeman husband begin to doubt her innocence, to the point where even she wonders if she somehow committed the violent horrible crime without remembering it.
