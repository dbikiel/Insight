One day, the Wolf stole the newborn Calf and brought him home to eat, but regretted it and decided not to eat it, but wait until he grows up. The Wolf becomes attached to the Calf, takes care of him, feeds milk, sings lullabies, reads books. For the sake of the Calf, the Wolf keeps cleanliness - "children - they can not grow in the mud." And the Wild Boar, which smokes a cigarette, the Wolf literally drives a rag. Gradually, the Wolf and the Calf are so used to each other that they began to live like a father and son.
