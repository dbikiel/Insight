Teacher Lola Blair is against building the saloon right next to her schoolhouse. When she is kidnapped, Hoppy rescues her and forces the saloon keepers to relocate.
Finishing a trail drive, Hoppy and the boys head to town and immediately get caught up in the conflict between school teacher Miss Abott and next door saloon owner Mawson. When Miss Abott disappears, Hoppy gets a clue to her location and rescues her from Mawson's cabin. It looks like Mawson is the man he wants, but Hoppy finds an item that indicates otherwise.
