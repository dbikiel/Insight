After enjoying a graduation party amid a cruise, an unexpected storm strikes, stranding a group of young friends on an uninhabited island (or so they thought.) Before they know it, they are thrown in a whirl-wind battle with the PIRATES OF GHOST ISLAND, whom have taken over the island for the last 200 years. Who survives?...
An unexpected storm at sea leaves six young friends shipwrecked on an uninhabited island. The island appears to be desolate, but when one of them is kidnapped before dawn, the terrified friends realize they are not alone. They are soon forced to battle for their lives with the PIRATES OF GHOST ISLAND, a terrorizing colony of bloodthirsty swashbucklers who have haunted these beaches for over 200 years.
