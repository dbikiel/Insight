When Jailer Vishwanath Pratap Singh slaps arch-criminal Dr. Michael Deng, he does not realize he has re-shaped his own future, as soon after his two sons, and daughter-in-law are mercilessly gunned down by Deng's men; his youngest son is crippled; and his wife, Rukmani loses her vocal chords. Now calling himself Dada Thakur, Singh is determined to bring an end to Deng, and recruits three prisoners on death-row, namely Baiju Thakur, Johny/Gyneshwar, and a former terrorist Khairuddin Kisti to assist him in his private war against Deng. Dada Thakur does not realize that his army of three have only agreed to join him so that they could enjoy freedom, away from the prison, and from certain death awaiting them.
