We often go to Africa, Australia, Brazil. Typically aircraft, and less on the water. But if you are a kitten and your name is Vasily. Then better than Voronezh no city anywhere.
In Voronezh in Lizyukova Street lives a kitten Vasily, who constantly has to flee from domestic dogs, and therefore he dreams of becoming such a beast that everyone would be afraid of. In this the crow-witch is going to help him. Vasily is transferred to Africa and turns into a hippopotamus. The kitten-behemoth gets acquainted with the elephant and other animals, but such a transformation does not cause him much enthusiasm. He accidentally angers a lion, rescues an ostrich from a crocodile and experiences a flood. Yearning for home, the hippopotamus hangs on the trees and rocks tablets "Lizyukov Street", as on houses in Voronezh. Once in these places flies a familiar crow in search of customers. Behemoth gladly declares that he wants to turn back. The crow returns Vasya home in its original form. Now he is not afraid of the puppy, but he himself frightens him with the roar of the hippopotamus.
