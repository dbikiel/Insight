Never one to turn down a dare, Jimmy Hughes--a wealthy but eccentric lawyer--takes his faithful butler Jasper and gets a job digging ditches to fulfill a bet he made with two reporters. In his new job he meets Trudy Olson, the daughter of the city's mayor who is running for re-election. A misunderstanding with Trudy results in Jimmy announcing his intention to run against the mayor. This winds up getting him involved with crooked cops, gamblers, corrupt politicians and greedy businessmen.
