A Chelsea art gallerist falls for a brooding new music composer in this comic tale about the state of contemporary art.
A fashionable contemporary art gallerist in Chelsea, New York falls for a brooding new music composer in this comic satire of the state of contemporary art.Adam Goldberg (Two Days in Paris) plays the serious composer, whose work calls for paper crumpling, glass breaking and bucket kicking. Marley Shelton (Grindhouse) plays the gorgeous Chelsea gallerist, whose latest show features an artist (Vinnie Jones) who employs taxidermy and household objects.Further complicating the affair is the composers brother, played by Eion Bailey (Band of Brothers), whose highly commercial art work the financial backbone of the gallery - is sold to corporate clients discreetly out of the gallerys back room.
