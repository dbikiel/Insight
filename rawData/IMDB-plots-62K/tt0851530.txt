A couple rents out a room to a mysterious young man, who may or may not be guilty of a series of grisly neighborhood murders.
The tale of a serial killer in West Hollywood has two converging plot lines. The first involves an uneasy relationship between a psychologically unstable landlady and her enigmatic lodger; the second is about a troubled detective engaged in a cat-and-mouse game with the elusive killer, who is imitating the crimes of Jack the Ripper.
When a prostitute is found slain in West Hollywood, the veteran Detective Chandler Manning investigates the case with his rookie partner Street Wilkenson. Manning is facing a domestic problem with his wife that had had a nervous breakdown and is interned in an institution and his daughter that blames him for the situation of her mother. Meanwhile, the unstable and disturbed housewife Ellen Bunting and her frequently absent husband Bunting are facing financial problems and need to rent a guest house in the backyard. When the mysterious writer Malcolm Slaight rents the house, Bunting never sees the lodger and believes his wife is fabricating the tenant and her family has given the money to them. When a second hooker is found dead on the street, Manning concludes that the killer is copycatting the crimes of Jack the Ripper and is the same serial-killer that had murdered other streetwalkers seven years ago. Further, he concludes that the criminal Alonzo Rodriguez was wrongly sentenced to death for the murders.
