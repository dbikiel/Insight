This film charts the relationship between a man imprisoned for drug smuggling and his wife and is being shot over the course of five years, a few weeks at a time.
Over a period of five years Karen takes her four young children on the long and laborious journey to visit her husband Ian, who is imprisoned for an unspecified crime. Away from the jail life goes on - the kids get into a fight when another school kid taunts them about their father. Karen, feeling lonely, sleeps with Eddie (from the pub where she works). Towards the end of his sentence Ian is given a day out to spend with the family. Disaster almost strikes after an allegation of drug smuggling, but somehow the family pulls through.
