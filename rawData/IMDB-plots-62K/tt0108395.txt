An evil witch banishes a flower loving troll named Stanley, to New York City, where he befriends two young children.
Stanley is a kindhearted, popular troll who can create flowers with a mere touch. When Gnorga, the mean-spirited Queen of the Kingdom of Trolls discovers Stanley's secret, she banishes him to a faraway place where she assumes nothing green can grow - New York City! Taking refuge in Central Park, Stanley befriends two young children, Gus and his baby sister Rosie. The three share wonderful adventures until Gnorga decides to let her mischief-making magic loose in the Big Apple.
A friendly troll with a magic green thumb grows one flower too many for the queen, whose laws require all trolls to act meanly, be ugly and scare humans whenever possible. As a punishment, he is exiled to a world of concrete, where he should live a life of proper trolldom: Manhattan. But of all places, his pod lands in Central Park, where he feels right at home. He befriends a young brother and sister, out for the day unknown to their parents, and must immediately protect them from the queen's attack. This is an adventure that teaches the importance of love and responsibility.
When his parents are too busy to take him to the park, a bratty boy named Gus, followed by his toddler sister Rosie, take off on their own. While Gus plays with his toy boat, Rosie gets herself into a large underground area. There she meets Stanley, a friendly troll with a green thumb that will grow a flower at his thumb's touch. This run-down underground cave is now Stanley's home after he is exiled to Central Park from his home world, a terrible loveless dark troll world, for growing flowers. Gus is introduced to Stanley by Rosie and is not impressed. But when Gnorga, the evil queen of the troll world, comes to Manhattan armed with her purple thumb that turns things to stone, she sniffs Stanley out, with intentions of bringing Stanley, his friends and the city to a terrible conclusion.
