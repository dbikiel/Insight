Wrangler Clay Phillips and his younger brother Steve are taking horses to their ranch near Sonora when they come across four dance hall girls heading the same way with a wrecked buggy. One of the girls is taken away by a boyfriend who came after her. Clay takes the girls on to the nearest ranch, where it turns out one of the girls is the homesteaders' wayward daughter. As Clay already has an escaped killer and his two fellow convicts after him he is reluctant to have to take the remaining two girls on with him but they are set on getting to Sonora.
Mary Wells and her dance hall coworkers Elaine, Helen and Marcia, are forced out of town by the reform element, and start for Sonoma, California. Along the way their wagon breaks down and they meet Clay Phillips and his kid brother Steve, and Mary asks for their help. Clay grudgingly agrees to take them as far as the next ranch as he has troubles of his own. He and Steve are driving a herd of blooded horses to their ranch, and trying to avoid an escaped convict, Ledvon, and his two fellow convicts who has sworn to kill Clay on sight. Marcia's boy-fiend arrives and Marcia leaves with him to get married. At the Wyatt Ranch, Elaine is reunited with and remains with her parents. Mary and Helen persuade Clay to take them to Sonoma and Mary continues to teach Steve to read along the way. The party reaches the camp of a young prospector, Fowler, and Helen decides to stay with him. Shortly afterward, Lednov and his two escaped henchmen arrive and learn that Clay is just ahead of them and they follow on to the inevitable showdown.
