A valiant mongoose enters into an unequal battle with two snakes while tries to protect a human family.
The film takes place in the jungles of India. There is located the bungalow of the forester Robert Lawson. His son named Teddy walks through the forest with his friend, a Hindu boy named John. Together they swim around the lake in a boat made of reeds, watch the animals around them, which are very many in the jungle. But suddenly a thunderstorm came that made the guys hide near the shore. From there, they watched how a very strong current carried away various animals, which vainly resist the rapid flow. One animal, the mongoose, is saved by Teddy, who for this has rushed into the water. But this help was very expensive for the boy: he stopped walking because of a bruised back.
