A bored accountant can't win for losing. He is passed over for promotion at work, has a nagging shrew of a wife, and is generally disrespected by all he comes in contact with. He devises a scheme to get what he feels he is owed. After executing his well thought out plan of kidnap and ransom, things soon go straight to hell.
