"A glove contest between trained cats. A very comical and amusing subject, and is sure to create a great laugh." (by Edison Films)
An epic struggle for power, glory and redemption. Two magnificent cats battle in the squared circle for the heavyweight championship of the world. Millions of Lolcats have followed in their wake, but these two combatants can always claim the title of the FIRST Lolcats!
Henry Welton presents two of the trained cats that appear in his vaudeville performances. The cats appear in a miniature boxing ring, and they are wearing miniature boxing gloves on their front paws. As Professor Welton looks on, they spar in a manner similar to that of human boxers.
