After fifty mail-order brides are kidnapped by bandits, the blind gunfighter hired to escort them heads into Mexico in pursuit.
Blindman (Tony Anthony) is a blind gunfighter who rides a seeing-eye horse, Boss. He is contracted to provide safe transport for fifty European mail-order brides, who have asked miners in Lost Creek, Texas, for their hands in marriage, for fifty thousand dollars, but his business partner, Skunk, betrays him by allowing Domingo (Lloyd Battista), a Mexican bandit, to kidnap the women for his own purposes. Blindman heads into Mexico in pursuit, where he discovers that Domingo and his sister, Sweet Mama (Magda Konopka), are using the women as a lure for an Army General, who they intend to hold for ransom. With the aid of Pilar (Agneta Eckemyr) (the unwitting object of Domingo's brother Candy's (Sir Ringo Starr's) affections), "El General" (Raf Baldassarre), Boss, and many sticks of dynamite, our anti-hero stops at nothing to get even with Domingo and his siblings, and deliver on his contract.
