Filmmaker Rick Sebak takes his cameras across the country in search of the various hot dogs people enjoy. We see the Super Duper Hot Dog stand and its variety of toppings and sauces. There is an in-depth study of the Chicago-area hot dog stands, in particular the Superdawg. Other hot dog establishments in all of their shapes forms and gimmicks (think the Varsity restaurant's "WhaddyahaveWhaddyahaveWhaddyahave?") Then we come to the New York City area and Gray's Papaya and Nathan's Hot Dogs, where each has their own method of cooking and serving their franks. The annual Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest is also featured.
