A boy looks through glasses at various objects, seen magnified.
Demonstrating the brand-new technique of close-up through the use of a circular mask, the director alternates medium shots with extreme point-of-view shots to simulate the magnification of various objects. As a sweet grandmother organises her sewing basket, Willy, her inquisitive little grandson, plays with her magnifying glass to look at the inside of a pocket watch, only to soon turn his attention to a caged bird, grandmother's rolling eye, and lastly, a well-fed cat.
A framing with the matte highlights what a grandmother sees from her magnifying glass. A middle-field shows her grandmother with a girl, then through a mask her grandmother sees a little bird in a cage. The girl puts the lens in front of her grandmother's eye, which moves quickly in one detail.
A child borrows his grandmother's magnifying glass to look at a newspaper ad for Bovril, at a watch, and then at a bird. The child shows grandma what he is doing. The child looks next at grandma's eye, then at a kitten.
