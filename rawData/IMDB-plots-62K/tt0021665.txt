Swans swim by; a peacock displays its plumage in glorious black-and-white while a passing duck jeers; assorted songbirds chirp; a woodpecker chases a caterpillar; a chorus of owls croons. A chicken goes after worms while ignoring her brood until a hawk circles. When the hawk captures one chick, the crows form an attack squadron.
