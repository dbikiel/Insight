Surreal dark comedy in which a man and a woman get stuck in an elevator and are forced to live there for several months.
Jim is a shy, withdrawn loner, pervert, and virgin. Lana is a friendly and outgoing born again Christian who has renounced her promiscuous drug filled past. They have never met until they step into an elevator together one day. The elevator gets stuck between floors, and they start to get to know each other. A building maintenance man assures them over the elevator's emergency intercom that an elevator repairman is on the way to let them back into their lives. Hours, days, weeks, and months pass, and no repairmen ever show up. Jim and Lana spend their days screaming into the intercom trying to get the maintenance guy to answer again. He doesn't. Starvation is not a problem for them, as Lana entered the elevator with a bag full of groceries which is mysteriously found to be filled with fresh food every morning. After enough time passes, Jim gives up hope of escape and resigns himself to building a new life in the elevator with who he sees as his first girlfriend. Lana on the other hand desperately wants to escape, and clings to her faith in God to provide them with an opening of the elevator doors. Eventually, a reluctant and desperate romance begins between the two, but it is promptly cut short by an inexplicable transformation of parts of Lana's body into metal.
