Paco, bored office worker, is a sexually repressed young man, of strict moral and serious convictions. Paco is annoyed by couples who kiss in parks and women with short skirts. Ang√©lica, his secretary and future wife, is even more repressed than him. Paco tries to recover lost time, putting into practice all the erotic fantasies that until then he had considered aberrant. Lying on the couch of his psychoanalyst, he will explain what his life trajectory has been.
