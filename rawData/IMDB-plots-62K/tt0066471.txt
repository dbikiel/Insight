A reluctant hero, American Lieutenant Sam Lawson, is secunded to a motley British unit tasked with destroying a Japanese radio on a Philippine island.
A World War II movie set on a Pacific island. Japanese and Allied forces occupy different parts of the island. When a group of British soldiers are sent on a mission behind enemy lines, things don't go exactly to plan. This movie differs in that some of the "heros" are very reluctant, but they come good when they are pursued by the Japanese, who are determined to prevent them returning to base.
In the spring of 1942, in the southwest Pacific, Captain John G. Nolan postpones the leave of the volunteer Lieutenant Sam Lawson. Instead, he gives him an assignment in the New Hebrides with British troops, based on the required profile, fluency in Japanese. When Lieutenant Lawson arrives in the base, the Commander explains that the island is divided between the British and Japanese sectors. Lieutenant Lawson asks him to go with a group of soldiers behind Japanese lines to destroy their radio and transmit a false message to the Japanese forces. Captain Hornsby is assigned to lead the group. However, during the tense mission, he has disagreements with the insubordinate Private Tosh Hearne. When things go wrong, the soldiers have to fight to survive while exposing their weakness in character.
