Bill saves his friend Larry from hanging and then tries to get him to join him in becoming a rancher. But Larry joins up with outlaw Carew and when Bill goes after him he accidentally shoots and kills Larry. Planning to marry Ann, Bill now hangs up his guns. But when Carew comes looking for him he straps on Larry's gun and heads out to meet him.
Mitch Carew (Dick Curtis) is released from prison and returns to Arroyo intending to get revenge on "Wild Bill" Hickok (Bill Elliott) and Dan Woodworth (John Dilson), who were responsible for his conviction six years earlier. Carew meets Woodworth on the street and cold-bloodedly shoots him through the heart. Hickok, who has been away for some time, comes to town with plans to settle down, and learns of the killing and that his old friend, Larry Armstrong (Richard Fiske), has joined the outlaw's gang. Hickok rides to the gang's hideout, finds Larry alone but can not convince him to leave Carew. When Hickok rides away, Carew, hiding in ambush, takes a shot at him and hits his hat. Spinning around, Hickok sees Larry with a drawn gun, and fires at him, unaware of Carew's presence. He rides back and finds that his dead friend's gun has not been fired, and he throws Larry across his saddle, and escapes the outlaw's ambush. In town, his fianc√©e, Anne Woodworth (Luana Walters) denounces the "code of the west" and Hickok agrees to hang up his guns. Carew later rides into town and announces that he is looking for Hickok. The latter, following a bitter argument with Anne, feels he can not refuse to accept Carew's challenge, and straps on his guns and goes to meet Carew.
