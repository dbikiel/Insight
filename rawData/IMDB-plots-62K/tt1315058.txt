A gentle Jamaican woman reunited with her husband in post-World War II London encounters both racism and homesickness as she adjusts to her new life.
In 1939 Hortense, illegitimate but intelligent and ambitious, is brought up on Jamaica with the family of charismatic, free-thinking Michael, who joins the Air Force when war breaks out and goes to England. After the war, Hortense, now a qualified teacher, makes a marriage of convenience to Gilbert Joseph, paying for his passage to England on condition he sends for her. She not only hopes to see Michael again but believes that living in Britain will give her more scope. When she arrives in London in 1948, she is extremely disappointed by the one room in which they must live and the obvious colour prejudice. Queenie, their liberal landlady, is also a woman used to disappointment, marrying decent but dull and sexless Bernard to get her away from the family farm. Whilst Bernard - now presumed missing - was in the Air Force during the war, she first took in lodgers from the armed forces, partly for the company, including Michael, with whom she had sex.
In the concluding episode both Hortense and Gilbert suffer colour prejudice as her teaching qualification from Jamaica is not recognized in England and he is bullied at work. However the shared experience brings them closer and she comes to love him. Michael reappears,on his way to emigrate to Canada to avoid bigotry,but he spends a night with Queenie,who ends up pregnant. After he has gone Bernard returns,after being interned,and wants to make it up to Queenie and start again. Fortunately for all concerned Hortense and Gilbert experience an unexpected stroke of luck which will benefit everybody.
