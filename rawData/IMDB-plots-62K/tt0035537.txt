Two titled aristocrats support themselves by being professional house guests in the homes of star-struck American nouveau riche.
Princess Victoria 'Vicki' Wilomirska and Baron Nicholas Eugen August Wolfgang 'Nikki' Prax are expatriate European nobles with no assets or property except their aristocratic pedigrees. They have become professional house guests at homes of socially ambitious nouveau riche Americans who want the prestige of playing hosts to these titled spongers. However, when Vicki and Nikki want to get married, they find that married royals are not in demand as eligibly unmarried ones. Ultimately one of these socially attractive, unambitious bluebloods will have to do the unthinkable and actually get a job.
