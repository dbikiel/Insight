The lives of a troubled veteran, his nurse girlfriend and a naive boy intersect first in Alberta and then in Belgium during the bloody World War I battle of Passchendaele.
Sergeant Michael Dunne fights in the 10th Battalion, AKA The "Fighting Tenth" with the 1st Canadian Division and participated in all major Canadian battles of the war, and set the record for highest number of individual bravery awards for a single battle.
In 1917, in World War I, the veteran Sergeant, Michael Dunne, is wounded at the front and nursed by Sarah Mann. He is diagnosed as neurasthenic and returns to his hometown, Calgary, to work in the recruitment section. When Sarah's asthmatic brother, David, is enlisted and demands that this be recognized by the father of his girlfriend, Cassie Walker. Sarah believes that Michael is responsible, and blames him for the engagement of her brother in the army. Michael re-enlists, using his mother last name, in order to protect David and they are sent to the no man's land at the front line of the Battle of Passchendaele.
Set during the height of the First World War, Passchendaele tells the story of Sergeant Michael Dunne (Paul Gross), a soldier who is brutally wounded in France and returns to Calgary emotionally and physically scarred. While in the military hospital in Calgary, he meets Sarah (Caroline Dhavernas), a mysterious and attractive nurse with whom he develops a passionate love. When Sarah's younger asthmatic brother David (Joe Dinicol) signs up to fight in Europe, Michael feels compelled to return to Europe to protect him. Michael and David, like thousands of Canadians, are sent to fight in the third battle of Ypres, a battle against impossible odds, commonly known as "Passchendaele". It is a story of passion, courage and dedication, showing the heroism of those that fought in battle, and of the ones that loved them.
