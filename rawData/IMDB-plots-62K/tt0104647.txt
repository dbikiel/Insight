George Kuffs didn't finish high-school, just lost his job and his girlfriend who still is in college is pregnant. Since he can't see how he can support her, he thinks she is better off without him. So he visits his elder brother, Brad, to squeze him for a loan so he can go to Brazil where there's a gold-rush going on. Unfortunately Brad is killed and George is suddenly the owner of Brad's "patrol special" district.

George Kuffs is a flake who's a high school drop out and who's irresponsible. When his girlfriend tells him she's pregnant he freaks out and she dumps him. He goes to his brother, Brad to ask him for money but Brad puts his foot down and tells George it's time to shape up. Brad runs a Special Police Force and tells George to work for him. Before he could decide, Brad is killed. George sees the man who killed him, but because he didn't actually see him kill his brother the man is released. George takes over his brother's district and sets out to get the man who killed his brother. The police assign a detective to keep an eye on him but George finds a way around him and nearly gets killed. His employees don't think he should be in charge. And a man approaches George and offers to buy his district which George thinks is suspicious. So he follows him too.
