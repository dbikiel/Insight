A half man/demon is being guarded by a drunken Shaolin magician named Chan at the Shaolin temple. One day, Chan sneaks out to go on a drinking splurge, and the man/demon escapes. Chan, and his friend Ah Yuen, and his bride-to-be, plus Grandma Yau, help Chan to capture the evil magician and return him back to Shaolin.
