"It's young Lucy's first day as a trainee in-house caregiver. She visits Mrs Jessel, an old woman who lies in cerebral coma, by herself, in her large desolate house. Learning by accident that Mrs Jessel, a former dance teacher of repute, supposedly possesses a treasure somewhere in the house, Lucy and friends William and Ben decide to search the house in the hope of finding it. At night, they get into the house, which reveals itself to be increasingly peculiar. Their hunt for Mrs Jessel's treasure leads them into a horrifying supernatural series of events that will change Lucy forever..."
On her first day as an in-home caregiver trainee for the elderly, young Lucie who is under the wing of the seasoned caregiver Mrs Wilson will visit the last patient on their rounds, Mrs Deborah Jessel, a once distinguished ballet instructor who is now, unfortunately, confined to bed, unresponsive and catatonic. With rumours of a big treasure hidden somewhere inside Mrs Jessel's once renowned classical dance academy, Lucie will share all the little details with her boyfriend William, who after a night at the pub, will risk with his friend Ben to break into the vacant and derelict mansion. However, before the end of the night, it will become quite clear that what seemed like a great opportunity for some easy money, is instead an irresistible lure to a fiendish and deadly trap.
