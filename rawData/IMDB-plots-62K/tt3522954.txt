A mother rabbit and her three kits are playing in a field. A little girl comes across one of the kits and steals it, dressing it up and playing with it as if it were a living doll. While the girl is distracted, the three other rabbits come to the rescue.
The little girl found a bunny in the garden that ran away from her mother hare and took him for a living doll. She called her a "daughter Katya", shook her in diapers, tied a bow to each ear, and began to feed her with porridge and sweets. The little hare did not eat sweets and always wanted to get out of the cradle and run away. The girl decided that she was sick, and went for medicines. But then the hare, finding out where her baby was, seized the moment and with the help of her other children took her back to the field.
