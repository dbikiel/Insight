Nurse Mary Lamont is excited about her brother's impending visit. The young man's strange behavior puzzles Dr. Kildare who believes he may be hiding a serious illness.
Dr. Jimmy Kildare and Nurse Mary Lamont are all sent to get married and her brother Doug Lamont has come to New York. When Jimmy meets him he notices strange behavior on his part such as sudden inattention or acting as if he was hearing sounds that are non-existent. The doctor starts to diagnose him and comes to the conclusion that he probably has epilepsy, a hereditary disease that could conceivably affect Mary as well, even though she has never shown any symptoms. Dr. Kildare is worried about this part of medicine and how you tell someone that they have a disease that they can do nothing about. It's left to Dr. Leonard Gillespie to come up with a solution and ensure that Jimmy and Mary can still get married.
