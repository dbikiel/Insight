Told in four vignettes, this existential comedy relates the exploits of four aspiring criminals who hope to improve their lot, but find that they might not have what it takes for a life of crime.
This is just another roadside cafeteria. Gino, who enters it discreetly, is an armed robber ... without an arm! He tries to hold up the place but fails pitifully: the pretty waitress won't allow! Two amateur kidnappers take a rich teenage girl hostage and want to exchange her for ransom. But their victim is not easy to deal with. Two singers meet in the cafeteria by chance and talk about a stolen song and a stolen woman. Five seventy-year-old retired robbers also meet at the cafeteria - where their hideout used to be - and work out a last caper. In the end, after having tried to steal from each other, go away together.
Pivoting around a Parisian out-of-the-way highway café, four stories of ambitious criminal aspirations intersect, as a motley crew of deliciously maladroit criminals cross paths. Gino, the down-and-out and considerably unprepared petty thief, orchestrates a stick-up, only to realise that others, too, have had the same plan. Then, the pair of companions and inept first-time kidnappers, Léon and Paul, summon up the courage to abduct Malaury, the troubled daughter of an affluent businessman; nevertheless, they bit off more than they could chew. In the following segment, two friends and lead singers past their prime, Alain Bashung and Arno, meet at the remote diner, and, much to their surprise, they find out that none is willing to let bygones be bygones. Finally, in the last vignette, a weary quintet of septuagenarian former gangsters is forced to confront an ever-changing new world, depending, solely, on their admirable camaraderie. However, have they all wanted to be a gangster?
