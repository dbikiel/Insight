Miranda is a crew member of a nightly radio programmme. She and her husband Felix, a cop, are parents of a girl. Miranda's daily dog walking strolls are excuses to pursue sexual encounters with men, who she readily discards afterwards. In order to deal with her sex addiction, she signs up for therapy. Also in the group is Javier, a successful scriptwriter and producer who is a sex-phone junkie. The two misfits hit off and a steamy affair ensues. But things get a little complicated when Javier finds out that this phone sex trysts have been secretly taped and being distributed all over Madrid, and that his ex-wife is living with his business partner. Elsewhere, while investigating a murder case, Felix discovers Miranda's affair with Javier.
