As WWII comes to an end, a group of Buchenwald's emaciated prisoners risk their lives for the safety of the camp's youngest inmate: a four-year-old Auschwitz-born Jewish prisoner. Is there a future for the Buchenwald boy?
Taking place at the Concentration camp Buchenwald at the end of March 1945, prisoner Hans Pippig discovers in a carrying case of an incoming prisoner a Jewish child. If reported the three-year-old is sure to die. On the other hand, a violation of the rules of the camp would threaten the long prepared uprising of the concentration camp prisoners against the SS.
As WWII comes to an end, the emaciated prisoners at the nightmarish Buchenwald concentration camp struggle to stay alive, clinging to the silent rumours that it's only a matter of time before the Allied Forces arrive to liberate them. Against the backdrop of a volatile and dangerously tense situation, the unexpected arrival of a four-year-old Auschwitz-born Jewish prisoner in a worn-out leather suitcase threatens to further complicate matters, as a group of inmates selflessly risk their lives for the boy's safety. Is there a future for the Buchenwald boy?
