Gii and Takumi are trying to get thought this school year, without being seen together and it still hurts, but takumi's "human" phobia is still better. It's close to the day of his older brother's death and Gii wants to go with him to his grave. The day of his brothers death are the school tournaments are going on too, and Gii is participating and is favored to win. At hearing this Takumi is heart broken because Gii can only do one, or can he do both? This fifth movie is possibly the best but that's up for you to decide. Me I know i want their to be many more, b ut I could live with just these five.
