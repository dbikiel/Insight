Dropping out of high school, two friends at first find success, one as a up-and-coming boxer and one as a low level gangster. Yet, their life decisions still find a way of catching up with them.
Two buddies visit the schoolyard of the high school they used to attend, and remember their young and dumb days. They used to be the bullies in the school, until they find their own ways of life; one as a boxer, and the other as a member of the yakuza.
Two school-age chums, Shinji and Masaru, spend most of their school days harassing fellow classmates, playing pranks, and sneaking to the movies. They decide to drop out and gain their fortunes in the outside world. Shinji becomes a small-time boxer, while Masaru joins up with a local Yakuza gang. Over the years the two do well, but their undisciplined nature comes back to haunt them.
