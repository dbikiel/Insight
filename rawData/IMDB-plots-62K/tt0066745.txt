Master gunslinger Sabata helps a band of Mexican revolutionaries steal a wagon-load of gold.
In Mexico, during the rule of the self-proclaimed Emperor of Mexico Maximillian (1864-1867), Mexican revolutionaries and Republican forces try to bring former Mexican President Benito Juárez back to power. The United States in neutral and is going through the pains of the American Civil War. Mexican guerrilla leader Señor Ocaño hires gunfighter Sabata to steal a wagon-load of gold from Emperor Maximillian's Austrian and French forces. When Sabata and his friends, Escudo and Ballantine, finally get their hands on a wagon, they discover it's full of sand rather than gold. They suspect that the gold was stolen by Austrian Colonel Skimmel. Therefore, Sabata and his partners set out to find the gold and give it to the Mexican revolutionaries.
In 1867 Mexico, under the oppression of the murderous Austrian Colonel Skimmel, Juarez's revolutionaries are determined to thwart his plans and steal Emperor Maximilian's mythical gold to trade it for weapons. For that reason, the expert sharp-shooter dressed in black, Sabata, and his unlikely ally, the aristocratic con artist, Ballantine, sign up for the dangerous robbery, and ultimately, they succeed in their mission. However, when they both realise that they have been tricked by the evil Skimmel, they plan to steal the precious gold anew, this time, keeping an eye on adversaries who pose as friends, and friends who may be enemies. Will Sabata manage to pull victory out of the hat?
