Aunt Agnes (Prunella Scales) vainly tries to force Emily (Georgina Cates) to marry boring Cedric Trilling (Robert Portal) by taking them to Italy and India hoping that Emily will forget about the handsome George (Sean Pertwee).
Young upper-class fellow Edward (Samuel West) arrives with his friend Cedric Trilling (Robert Portal) at the family manse, Ivory Hall. He plans to pair off Cedric with his sister Emily (Georgina Cates). Emily, on the other hand, falls in love with a son of local peasant, George (Sean Pertwee). Old Aunt Agnes (Prunella Scales) sends all the bunch off, first to Italy and then to India, so Emily would forget George, who is an undesirable partner for her because of class differences, and choose Cedric.
Emily (Georgina Cates) is now twenty-two and ripe for marriage. Her idiotic brother Edward (Samuel West) decides, in cahoots with Aunt Agnes (Prunella Scales), to pair her off with his upper-class twit friend Cedric Trilling (Robert Portal). Emily has already had and refused a proposal of marriage from the local vicar Mr. Tweeb (Richard Braine) on the eminently sensible grounds that his eyebrows were too bushy. An accident at the family lake brings Emily very closely into contact with the naked, handsome, muscular, lower-class peasant George, and she is instantly attracted to his ripping unmentionables. Seeing the undesirability of the match, Aunt Agnes takes the family first to Italy, and then to India to try to separate the lusty, ill-matched couple, but George accompanies them as a servant.
