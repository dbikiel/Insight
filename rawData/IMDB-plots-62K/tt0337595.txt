This documentary explores the world of hobos and freight train hopping. Filmmaker Sarah George follows Switch and Baby Girl, two hobos who must give up the rails when Baby Girl becomes pregnant with child. We also meet Lee, who lives in the forest when he isn't riding the rails. We see hobo culture as an adventurous rejection of the modern humdrum of American life.
Over a period of five years, filmmaker Sarah George chronicled the lives of several modern-day train hoppers, a vanishing culture to which she also belongs. These individualists choose to eschew the comforts of modern American life to pursue the freedom and unpredictability of riding the rails, a choice that reflects both their lifestyle preference and a personal philosophy that is often based on environmental concerns. Through Sarah's insightful interviews, the modern hobos discuss their unique experiences and the incredible thrill of train-hopping.
