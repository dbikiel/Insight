Some shadows in a street wall turned into a bunch of eight crackpots, each of them playing a different musical instrument. Then they changed into several objects like a drum or umbrellas and, finally, they completely disappeared.
A nondescript band stands in the street giving vent to the most unearthly row. Deafened by the discordant noise, the inhabitants around throw water over the musicians, who immediately dissolve and disappear. Suddenly huge humid spots appear on the wall, take the shapes of the musicians, form into solid bodies, and once again the musicians recommence that awful refrain. Marching further along the street they seize some gaudy colored umbrellas. After a number of startling changes, in which the umbrellas take the leading part with very beautiful effect, the musicians return to their shanty and continue to play their awful tune.
