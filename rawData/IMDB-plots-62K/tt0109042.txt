Two young women bond while living together out in the California desert to be close to their boyfriends who are serving time at the nearby state prison.
Kathy and Carmen are two young women from Los Angeles, with nothing in common, who are forced to shack up together along with Carmen's young son in a run-down trailer deep in the California Mojave desert to be close to their boyfriends who are serving long prison terms at the nearby state prison.
Two women move in together in a trailer owned by the sleazy lawyer who defended their boy friends after they were arrested for selling dope to undercover agents. With no money and little job prospects, the two struggle to make ends meet. Initially considering becoming prostitutes, a helpful man aids them in getting jobs as a barkeep and in a grocery. But when drug agents claim the trailer they live in, things just become worse. Paco is Carmen's young son, who befriends an old prospector and a man who keeps a trained lion and tiger in the desert.
