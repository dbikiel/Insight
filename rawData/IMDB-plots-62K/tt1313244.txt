Ray Pelletier just wants to spend a pleasant and relaxing weekend ice fishing with his family. Alas, Ray's plans are ruined by the unwanted presence of the obnoxious big city father and son duo of Steve Cote and Stevie Jr. However, the two squabbling families are forced to set aside their differences and work together after a vicious monster awakens from the cold waters of the remote frozen lake area they are staying at.
This film is about Ray Palletier ('Michael Rooker') and his family. They have a cabin near a frozen lake where they can go fishing through the ice. But when Steve Cote and his son Stevie turn up in a custom made portable fishing hut making lots of noise it attracts something living under the ice, something that will endanger all of them. Ray sets aside his differences with Steve and they join forces to try and catch whatever it is swimming under them and they turn from the hunters to the hunted. Will they catch this thing or will it catch them?
