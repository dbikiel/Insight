An elderly piano teacher trains a young convict at a women's penitentiary.
In Germany, the elder Frau Traude Krueger gives piano classes in a prison for a few prisoners and the security guard MÃ¼tze. When she sees the rebel and aggressive Jenny Von Loeben playing piano, she immediately identifies her potential and offers to teach her for a competition. Frau Krueger finds that Jenny was a prodigy when she was a child; abused when she was a teenager and has been imprisoned for murdering and decapitating a man. Along the period they work together preparing for the exhibition, Frau Krueger discloses secrets about her love in World War II while the self-destructive Jenny has four minutes of glory and recognition of her talent.
Jenny is young but her life is over. She has been locked up in a women's prison for killing someone, and she would do it again. Buried beneath her impenetrable facade, however, Jenny has an invaluable musical talent.
When a 80-year-old piano teacher Traude Krueger discovers the girl's terrible secret, her raging brutality and her dreams, she makes it her mission to retransform Jenny into the musical wunderkind she once was.
