Deprogrammed is a feature-documentary about the rise of Ted 'Black Lightning' Patrick's deprogramming technique and anti-cult crusade. Deprogramming, as a form of cult intervention, started in 1971 and quickly snowballed into a vast underground movement composed of concerned parents, ex-cultist-turned-deprogrammers and some sympathetic law-enforcers whose mission was to physically and mentally remove individuals from groups referred to as 'cults'. Inspired by her stepbrother's deprogramming by Patrick in 1991, Mia Donovan meets the infamous 'Father of Deprogramming' himself and begins to unravel his notorious legacy.
