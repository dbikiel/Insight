A town almost ruined. A winning lottery ticket. A lot of troubles in progress.
Villaviciosa de al Lado is a peaceful town stuck in time, living exclusively off the fame of a 200 year-old spa. City Halls' debts threatens to close the spa and ruin the town. Their salvation comes when Mayor Anselmo and the rest of Councilors, realise they won the Christmas Lottery. Happiness turns to horror when they discover the prize belongs to a serial number distributed by the towns' brothel. The wives become suspicious and husbands fear, after a TV interview with Mari, the brothels' owner, claims the men of the town have won the lottery. Wanting a way to claim the prize and save the town, without suffering the wrath of their respective women, Anselmo, Ricardo, CÃ©sar, Juandi and Paco hatch a plan, to steal the money from the brothel. Meanwhile, Mari tries to reconcile her stranded life and restore the memory of her deceased father, the former Mayor, fired after Mari was pregnant as a teenager.
