Bosko and Honey yodel happily in the Alps until a series of disasters end with Honey rushing downriver on an ice floe.
Bosko and Honey yodel happily in the Alps, but then disaster strikes. Bosko slides down a tree to meet Honey, but loses control and falls onto a pair of wooden planks that double as skis. Bosko knocks down Honey, who falls downhill in a snowball until she smashes into a rock and topples over a cliff. Bosko, on his runaway skis, hits the same rock and comes to sudden stop. Now Honey is rushing downriver on an ice floe. As she cries for help, Bosko finds a St. Bernard and together they race to save Honey. Meanwhile, a mouse in Honey's home plays golf, using macaroni as a golf club, a pea as a ball and a slice of Swiss cheese as his golf course.
