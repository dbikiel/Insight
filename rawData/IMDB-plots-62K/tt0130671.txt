Exhausted is a self-serving softball "documentary" about John C. Holmes, who was the biggest star in the adult film industry in two ways. He was the most famous, and he was just the biggest where it really counts in that business, about 13 inches worth. The film combines footage from actual porn films, "man on the street" interviews, and interviews with industry insiders: director Bob Chinn, actress Seka, and John Holmes himself. While this film is a not bona fide documentary, detailing the life of John Holmes (before his notorious murder trial), it is still a very erotic and very arousing sex film. It is an attempt to dig into the career of John Holmes, one of the best-known male stars of hard-core pornography, most noted for his big gun. This excellent production was billed as the "true life story of the unchallenged King of Porn himself". If you watch it, its difficult to argue - Its packed with the most luscious, explosive women in adult entertainment from the early 80s. The movie in its day was the most publicized adult film to hit the screen since Deep Throat.
