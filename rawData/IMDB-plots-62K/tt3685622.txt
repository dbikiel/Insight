Arnulfo Rubio smuggles weapons for a deadly Mexican cartel. ATF agent Hank Harris attempts to apprehend him, but gets kidnapped by Rubio, instead. Rubio takes him to his bosses, but during the 600-miles-long drive, they slowly befriend.
With the hidden compartments of his SUV crammed with assault weapons, the young Sinaloan and low-level firearms smuggler, Arnulfo Rubio, attempts to cross the Mexican border, only to catch the eye of the veteran ATF agent, Hank Harris. However--not knowing what to do when he manages to turn the tables on Harris--Rubio decides to drive from America back to Mexico, to turn the captive over to the cartel. Now, the lives of the two men become inextricably intertwined--and as they head to a very dangerous place--the bitter adversaries will have to trust each other to make it out of there alive. Can they return to the United States in one piece?
