Karan and Khushi fall in love, but her conservative family balks at accepting Karan's modern ideas.
Karan, born in Calcutta, and Khushi, born in the small village of Chamoli, are destined to meet despite the distance between the two. Karan wants to go Canada to further her studies--but due to an accident that takes place, he is forced to continue his studies in Mumbai University. Khushi's father believes that for a girl the education that she has receives is enough and now she should stay with him and marry a boy who is ready to be his son-in-law. But Khushi insists on pursuing her education in Mumbai University. At the University Karan's friend Vicky and Khushi's friend Priya are in love, but are having relationship problems. Karan and Khushi decide to help Vicky and Priya come together, but end up making a romantic connection with each other.
Khushi Singh (Kareena Kapoor) is the only child of Vir Bhadra Singh (Amrish Puri) from Punjab, India, and he has loved and pampered her all her life, until when he asks her to get married. She reluctantly agrees, but then the groom had other plans, so Khushi decides to relocate to Bombay, India to continue with her studies. She meets with Karan Roy (Fardeen Khan) from West Bengal, India, and both fall in love. To complicate things, Zohravar Singh (Sharat Saxena) has sworn to avenge himself against Karan, for marrying his daughter, Priya, to a poor college student, Vicky. Khushi is puzzled about Karan's relationship with a woman named Madhu, and has seen him under very intimate circumstances with college student, Roma. The two are unable to reconcile their difference, and then it is now time for Karan to return home to re-locate to Canada, and Khushi must return to her home, and marry the man her dad has chosen for her.
