Police search for the killer of a man who misused $700,000 intended for the Chinese Communists.
Chinatown serves as the location where a Communist agent has been killed after he has been caught stealing money. The money was collected from Chinese people living in America. The police chase many leads and suspects until the killer is caught through the efforts of an ex-policeman turned bus driver.
