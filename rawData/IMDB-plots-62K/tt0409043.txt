A couple of incompetent door-to-door meat salesmen have fallen so far behind on their quotas that they are finally issued an ultimatum.
In L.A., Maurice and Dave sell steaks - high-end cuts of beef. They've hit a patch of no sales, and they're facing being fired. Maurice needs money to enroll in his final semester of acupuncture school, and the recently-separated Dave needs money for his daughter's birthday gift. Their final client card: a beautiful woman opens the door, and she's attracted to Maurice, but a desperate call from a suicidal friend interrupts her signing the contract. Still hoping to close the sale, Maurice and Dave offer to drive her to the friend's house, and there, troubles multiply. Facing guns, hitmen, and women's secrets, a sale is the farthest thing from their minds. Are they about to be grilled?
