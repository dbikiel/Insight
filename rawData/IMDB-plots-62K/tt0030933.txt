In the Dutch islands, the sister of a pious missionary attempts to reform a womanizing, drunken beach bum.
Ginger Ted, AKA Edward Claude Wilson (Charles Laughton) a drunkard and womanizer, and Miss Jones,(Elsa Lanchester) a missionary, live in the Alas Islands. During a cholera epidemic, Ginger Ted and Miss Jones are sent to an outlying part of the islands to run a hospital; on their return, their motorboat breaks down, and they are marooned overnight on a small island. Miss Jones is certain that Ginger Ted means to rape her as soon as the sun goes down. When morning comes and her virtue is still intact, she is convinced that he has had a change of heart and that he is a good man in spite of his many faults. Ginger Ted himself is outraged by this explanation; it never occurred to him to rape Miss Jones, who is middle-aged and unattractive. Nevertheless, at the end of the story, Miss Jones and Ginger Ted have married and Ginger Ted, now known as Edward, have moved back to England run an inn.
