The weather was beautiful. Princess was awful. At two o'clock in the afternoon princess get lost in the woods. Or maybe it was the other way around?
At the heart of the poem lies the change of adjectives "terrible" to "beautiful" and vice versa. In the first part, the beautiful Princess falls into a terrible dugout in terrible weather and the Ogre refuses to eat her, referring to a terrible appetite. In the second part, on the contrary, the terribly self-acting Princess falls into a beautiful (in her opinion) dug-out. The Ogre, despite his fine appetite, refuses to eat the Princess because of her terrible appearance. At the end of the cartoon the question is asked: "Maybe it was the other way around?"
