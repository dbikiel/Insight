High school misfit Louise, at a loss for romance, discovers magical abilities, but the teenage witch finds that she cannot conjure herself true love, so what?
Louise is not very popular at her high school. Then she learns that she's descended from the witches of Salem and has inherited their powers. At first she uses them to get back at the girls and teachers who teased her and to win the heart of the handsome footballer's captain. But soon she has doubts if it's right to 'cheat' her way to popularity.
Louise is an insecure big-haired brainy high school-er with an equally nerdy and enthusiastic best friend Polly. After a series of embarrassing events and bad luck, Louise finds herself at the palm reading parlor of Serena, a witch who reveals that Louise is also a witch who will gain powers on her impending 16th birthday. The next week, once she has turned 16, Louise finds this to be the case and accidentally turns her brother into a dog. After some hijinks, including a revenge scene with the popular girls and the infamous "Top That" scene between Polly and the closest thing her high school has to a rudimentary all-white hip-hop trio, Louise attempts to cast a love spell on Brad, her long-time crush. She gives up because she wants Brad to genuinely like her, but realizes that a new way to achieve his affection is to become popular. Louise casts a powerful popularity spell with the help of her mentor, Serena. (Serena is benefiting from Louise's fresh powers to add glamor to her own life.) Though she is skyrocketed into wild popularity, which brings the benefit of an extensive make-out with Brad, who slips her the tongue multiple times. However, in her quest for mass-love, she leaves her real friend behind and begins to question the value of her new-found life when it lacks the authenticity she craves.
