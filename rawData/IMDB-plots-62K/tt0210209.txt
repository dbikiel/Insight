Two anarchistic brothers live by petty thievery and try to recover from their Catholic upbringing. Bandiera (Laurent Terzieff) and Rabbino (Franco Citti) were children when they pushed their drunk of a father out of a window for killing their pet sheep. When a girl is raped by her father, she is brought by young "rescuers" to the home of the two brothers who then watch their friends take advantage of her sexually. The brothers take her in, and the three live happy and celibate if not uneventful lives until the brother's are sent to jail for stealing.The ending has a real life resemblance and makes you wonder, what P.P. had foreseen..
Screenplay, Davoli, Franco and Sergio Citti, aesthetics etc.
