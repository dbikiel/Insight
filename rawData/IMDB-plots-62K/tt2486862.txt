Battle Scars examines the war experience as well as the wrenching change many veterans face on returning home. Luke Stephens (Zane Holtz) shows up on his brother Nicky (Ryan Eggold)'s doorstep after a tour of duty in Afghanistan. Suffering from both PTSD and physical wounds, unseen but devastating, Luke wants nothing more than to forget the war, but his veteran father (David James Elliott) won't let him. At a local strip club, run by a ruthless killer (Fairuza Balk), Luke crosses paths with Michelle (Heather McComb) who leads him into a violent world every bit as dangerous and isolating as the brutality he desperately tried to leave behind in Afghanistan.
Every Marine has a story, some they're proud of, other they'd rather forget. After coming home from his tour of duty in Afghanistan suffering from PTSD, Luke Stephens wants nothing more than to forget. What happens when our soldiers come back to Another Stateside?
