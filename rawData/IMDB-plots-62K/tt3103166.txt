A pastor and professional wrestler accepts a position at a struggling church where he helps the community both in his official capacity and as his alter ego The Saint.
"The Masked Saint" is based on a true story about one pastor's mission to help his community by risking his identity and returns to his former life as a wrestler. The triumphant story follows one man's journey and struggle between helping others and the consequences he faces doing this.
The Masked Saint follows the journey of former professional wrestler Chris Samuels, who retires from the ring to settle down as a small town pastor. When the pastor witnesses rampant problems in the community, he decides to moonlight as a masked vigilante fighting the injustice. While facing crises at home and at the church, the Pastor must evade the police and somehow reconcile his secret, violent identity with his calling as a pastor. Inspired by true events, The Masked Saint is based on the highly popular book of the same name by Chris Whaley. It was filmed entirely in Northern Ontario, and features icons of the screen like Diahanne Carroll and 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper alongside stars Brett Granstaff and Lara Jean Chorostecki.
