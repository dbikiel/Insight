When their moonshiner father is killed by a corrupt deputy, two young girls decide to take over his business and get revenge on the men who had him killed.
A moonshiner has been given protection by the local sheriff. When the sheriff is bought off by a crooked local businessman, the moonshiner gets busted. He tries to flee, but he is shot by a sheriff's deputy. The moonshiner's car careens off a road, and he ends up dead. The moonshiner's adult daughters try to make ends meet on the family farm, but the bank (incidentally, also controlled by the same local businessman) forecloses on the property. Left with few options, the photogenic daughters decide to exact revenge on anyone who has wronged them in the recent past. They also carry out an elaborate plot to rob the local bank.
