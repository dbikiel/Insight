A liberated small-town girl and the family's black sheep moves to Paris with her sister, only to find herself standing trial for the shocking murder of her young lover. Was his killing premeditated or was this a crime of passion?
Dominique Marceau is on trial for the murder of Gilbert Tellier. The counsels duel relentlessly, elaborating explanations for why the pretty, idle and fickle girl killed the talented and ambitious conductor freshly graduated from the conservatory. Was it passion, vengeance, desperation, an accident? The acquaintances of Gilbert testify, as well as Dominique's former lovers, and her sister, Annie, the studious violin player engaged to Gilbert. The evidence they give progressively paints a more finely-shaded picture of the personalities of Dominique and Gilbert, and of their relationship, than the eloquent and convincing justifications of the counsels.
Unconventional, troubled, and suicidal, the beautiful small-town girl and the family's black sheep, Dominique Marceau, moves into a cramped Parisian apartment with her violin student sister, Annie, to flee from a suffocating life in the province. However, instead of finding liberty in the bohemian city of light, the liberated Dominique will find herself accused of a hideous and shocking crime: the gruesome murder of her young lover and hopeful conductor, Gilbert Tellier--Annie's soon-to-be husband. Little by little, as both judge and jury delve deeper and deeper into Dominique's lifestyle and her past, a provocative social kaleidoscope starts taking shape. Was Tellier's killing premeditated or was this a crime of passion?
