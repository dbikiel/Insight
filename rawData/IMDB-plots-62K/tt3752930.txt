A story centered around a divorced couple living in a southern Chinese city Shenzhen and dealing with the disappearance of their missing son.
After their 4-year old son was kidnapped from a super-crowded city, a divorced couple, joined by many parents who are in the same desperate situation, started to work together to find him. Fortunately they have the son back after 3 years, but the trouble does not end here.
