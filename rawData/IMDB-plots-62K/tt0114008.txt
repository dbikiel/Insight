Ray and his good friends grew up in their working class neighbourhood. Ray is a salesman but dreams of something more: he wants his own business, and wants to marry his childhood sweetheart Jo. In order to fulfill his dreams, Ray takes out a loan which is well beyond the re-payments he can make on his meagre income. His friends get dragged into the fall-out when he can't keep up with payments, but will they stand by him or has he pushed them too far this time?
