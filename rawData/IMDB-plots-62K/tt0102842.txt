A single New England woman responds to an advertisement by a Midwestern widower in which he asks for a bride to help him raise his two children.
Set around the turn of the century. Jacob, a widowed farmer with two small children, places an ad in a paper for a new wife. The ad is answered by a spinster in Maine, who writes letters to them and describes herself as "plain and tall." And she takes a trip to Jacob's farm to see if she can make a difference.
