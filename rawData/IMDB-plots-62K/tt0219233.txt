Surreal misadventures of a lazy drunkard with speech impediment trying to get a New Year tree on a short notice. Loosely based on folk fairy tales.
The main character of the animation is a silly, cunning, lazy and greedy little man. In addition, he is also a tongue-tied (he does not pronounce "some letters and numbers"), he likes to drink beer very much and constantly gets into silly situations. Fortunately, he has a "strict and authoritative" wife. The whole story begins with the fact that his wife sends a man to bring a Christmas tree from the forest to the New Year. But the New Year forest is a fabulous place full of unexpected events and transformations. Entangled in miracles, having repeatedly lost and regained his own image, the man returns home with nothing.
