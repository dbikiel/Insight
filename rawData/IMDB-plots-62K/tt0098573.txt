Baris, a 5 year-old little boy, has to stay in a prison with her mother during her detention period. Baris develops a special relationship with Inci, a young woman who also stays in prison. She promises him that the kite will fly someday.
In Türkiyë, when a woman is sent to prison, her small children stay with her. In this film, Inci (say "Injee") is sent to prison for murder in self-defense (which warrants incarceration in Türkiyë), and while there, develops a special friendship with a little boy who is the son of another inmate.
