Denise Crosby takes another look at the huge fans of "Star Trek" and how the series from around the world has affected and shaped their lives.
In this follow-up to the popular 1997 documentary, Denise Crosby returns for another look at fans of the "Star Trek" franchise. This time there are interviews with fans from other countries, updates on fans featured in the original film, and performances by "Star Trek"-themed "filk" bands. The filmmakers visited fans all over the world, including an Englishman who transformed his flat into a starship and listed this on the Internet for $2 million, and the first convention ever held in Serbia. The film also checks in on some of the original profilees like wunderkind Gabriel Koerner and alternate Whitewater juror Barbara Adams.
