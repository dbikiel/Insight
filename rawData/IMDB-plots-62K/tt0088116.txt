After a computer glitch accidentally releases a homicidal maniac, his doctor and some hospital staff track a trail of bodies to the sorority house where the killer committed his earlier crimes.
A homicidal maniac is accidentally released from a hospital because of a computer error and heads to the site (a sorority) of his past murders to continue his penchant for mayhem.
