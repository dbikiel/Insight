In the old African Wild West, a peace-loving family man moves to a vacant farm in search of a new life. His hopes are shattered when his son is badly beaten and his wife murdered by a gang of ruthless thugs. He is left helpless, until fate intervenes. He is rescued and nursed back to health by a good Samaritan living alone in the hills, a reformed gangster, who trains the man to exact his revenge.
