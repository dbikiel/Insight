A samurai travels to Edo with his two servants. On their way, they meet many people and encounter great injustice.
A young samurai, Shojuro Sako, travels on the Tokaido to Edo with his two servants, Genta and Gonpachi. Gonpachi has been told by Shojuro's mother to prevent his Master from drinking... The road is not safe. On the way, they meet young orphan boy, Jiro, and many other travellers: A team of great directors, including Yasujrio Ozu, Hirochi Shimizu and Daisuko Ito, assisted Uchida with his remarkable post-war comeback film. It's an affable samurai road movie with a focus on unglamorus characters, as a dim-witted samurai and his servants traverse the Tokaido highway. Much of the film is played as comedy, making the brilliantly staged violent climax all the more shocking.
