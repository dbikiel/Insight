Ciottoli is a journalist with absolutely no prospects for his career, a lot of debts and a mobster that wants him dead. Unexpectedly he wins the national lottery (almost Eur 2.5 million) and tries to remain anonymous, hiding the winning ticket in his typewriter. Ironically, his manager orders him to write an article on the mysterious winner. When he is back home he discovers all his furniture has been confiscated and will be sold at a public auction. He will try desperately to buy back the worthless typewriter while all his previous problems still follow him, especially the mobster.
