Gene Tierney and Ray Milland play the Sheridans, a married couple unable to have a biological child. They visit an adoption agency to make inquiries and start the ball rolling. Then, they learn of a child abandoned at a local police station. The loving and very lovely Midge (Tierney) is determined to adopt the young boy, no questions asked; Brad (Milland) insists on learning about the boy's heredity and his parentage. The Sheridans learn the boy's father may be a murderer. Will there be a baby for Midge? (The film is based on a novel by James R. Webb, entitled "A Baby for Midge.")
