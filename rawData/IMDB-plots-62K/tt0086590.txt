Toad (David Jason), Rat (Ian Carmichael), Mole (Richard Pearson), and Badger (Sir Michael Hordern) follow animal etiquette in this version of Kenneth Grahame's classic, in stop-motion model animation.
One spring, Mole (Richard Pearson) decides that he can ignore the spring cleaning for a little longer, and begins a series of adventures with his new friend Rat (Ian Carmichael). They go for a picnic on the riverbank, on a caravan expedition with Toad (David Jason), until Toad switches allegiance to his new car and his reckless driving makes Mole and Rat search out Badger (Sir Michael Hordern) for help in curbing Toad's profligate habits. But Toad gets away from them and gets a twenty-year sentence from the magistrate for theft, reckless driving, and Gross Impertinence. While Toad works his wiles on the jailer's daughter and escapes from jail dressed as a washer woman, Badger tries to guard Toad Hall from the machinations of the Weasels and is badly beaten. And it requires a plan of attack and all four comrades to regain Toad Hall.
Mole (Richard Pearson), taken from the fever of spring, comes out of his den, starting a journey with a friend, Rat (Ian Carmichael), on the river and in the woods, where there is the den of Badger (Sir Michael Hordern), and where they spend the lethargy. When the wind blows again in the willows in the spring, the three friends leave to change Toad (David Jason) for the better, that is very fickle.
