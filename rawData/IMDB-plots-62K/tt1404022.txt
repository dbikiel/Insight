Four characters are looking for a man called Castro, but we don't know why. For some mysterious reason, Castro is running. He has left his life behind, and survives by hiding in a room in a small city. He is basically alone, but someone has appeared in his life, Celia. She is young, beautiful, and sometimes cruel.
