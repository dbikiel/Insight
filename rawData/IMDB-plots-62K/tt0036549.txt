A woman wrongfully accused of being a Nazi sympathizer is forced to move to Halifax, a city in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia.
In 1940 Sally Maitland is forced to leave England, ostracised as a Nazi sympathiser by everyone including her well-to-do family. On the ship to Halifax, Canada, she is courted by Polish aristocrat Jan Orloch and by awkward British navel intelligence officer Jimmy Garrick. She shows herself somewhat more amenable to Orloch's advances, and agrees to meet his mother in Halifax. Once there however, it becomes clear no-one is really who they say they are.
In September 1940, a passenger ship, the SS Karina, is sailing from Liverpool to Halifax, which is seen as the most strategic port in North America for the naval military into the war theater. Many on board are making the dangerous journey to escape the war, but one passenger, British national Sally Maitland, who comes from a well known aristocratic family, has been banished from England for her pro-Nazi views. Those views have have made her the most hated person aboard the ship. One person aboard who befriends Sally is Jan Orlock, a Captain with the Polish military. The Nazi devastation of his country has resulted in his strong hatred of the Nazis. Nonetheless, he falls in love with Sally while trying to convince her to change her political views. He believes his mother can do so, she who he is visiting in Halifax where she is convalescing from injuries sustained during the Warsaw bombings. One other person aboard who seems interested in Sally is Jim Garrick, who doesn't want the passengers to know that he is a Lieutenant Commander in the British navy. Sally pays little attention to the seemingly buffoonish Jim. Beyond one potentially life threatening incident with a German military ship which puzzled the Karina's Captain Foster, the Karina does make it safely to Halifax. But life in Halifax for Sally, Jan, Madame Orlock and Jim is not all it appears on the surface.
