A white dog called Bim is looking for its owner. It encounters all kinds of people and situations.
A touching lyrical film story about the fate of a dog losing its beloved master, about people's attitudes towards the "smaller brothers", which radiates souls like an X-ray, revealing baseness and petty meanness in some, and nobility, compassion and love in others. The film was nominated for an Oscar film award in 1979 as the best film in a foreign language.
