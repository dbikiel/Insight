A surrealistic revision of Alice in Wonderland.
A memorably bizarre screen version of Lewis Carroll's novel 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland', mixing one live actor (Alice) with a large variety of stop-motion animated creatures, ranging from the complex (the White Rabbit) to the incredibly simple (the Caterpillar, consisting of a sock, a couple of glass eyes and a pair of false teeth). The original story is followed reasonably faithfully, though those familiar with this director's other films won't be the least bit surprised by the numerous digressions into Svankmajer territory, living slabs of meat and all. As the opening narration says, it's a film made for children... perhaps?
A very naughty, grimly stubborn (live) Alice lives in a large, semi-derelict building. An accident I her bedroom starts a surreal voyage trying to follow the white rabbit trough magical passages, trying out food shrinks or enlarges her. She takes little account of the trouble she causes to the strange inhabitants, mostly animals. She ends up in front of the royal couple, with the king insisting on a trial (albeit pro forma), while the queen is determined to have her head chopped off like many of the army playing cards.
