A trainload of silk puts Neil Hamilton on the fast track to murder in this full-throttle thrill ride costarring Sheila Terry and Guy Kibbee. As the demand for raw silk goes sky high, crooked businessman Wallace Myton (Arthur Hohl) corners the market with plans to drive up the price. Determined to fulfill his contracts, manufacturer Donald Kilgore (Hamilton) imports $3 million worth of silk to Seattle and accompanies it by special train to New York. But when his secretary is found murdered, Kilgore soon discovers Myton has planted three killers on board with orders to stop the express and its passengers dead in their tracks.
