Allan is a married father of three whose sex life takes another hit when his wife can no longer take the pill. He soon finds himself with an appointment for a vasectomy and a nagging identity crisis. Although he is by all reasonable accounts a good, responsible man, the thought of getting "fixed" drives him to lose himself to an action-packed midlife crisis along with his best friends. Allan will refuse to grow up anymore.
