The Clements father and son live by the generosity of rich women. Max, the son, sets his sites on Lady Joan, who is rich, but down-to-earth and charming. At her house he meets Rosine Brown, an Austrian widow involved with a rich man. Instantly infatuated with her, Max pursues Rosine until she relents and agrees to marry him. But the elder Clement loses 4500 pounds gambling and Max decides he must marry Joan to prevent his father's imprisonment.
Following in the footsteps of his now widowed father Florian Clement, Max Clement is a fortune hunter who preys on wealthy women in order to maintain a high standard of living. Their goal is for Max to marry a wealthy woman, but a beautiful but poor woman catching Max's eye always seems to get in the way. Florian ultimately married for love, which he considers a mistake that Max should not emulate. In quick succession, Max meets Lady Joan Culver and widowed Viennese Rosine Brown. He believes that Lady Joan will be his next conquest until he falls under the charms and beauty of Mrs. Brown, who is already seeing the self-admittedly dull but solid Sir George Kelvin. In Max's relentless pursuit of Mrs. Brown, he ultimately learns that she too is penniless, and agreed to marry Sir George if only to maintain a lavish lifestyle. Regardless, Max wants to marry her and give up his fortune hunting ways, to which a lovelorn Mrs. Brown agrees. But when a situation occurs with his father, Max has to decide if love or what money can buy with regard to his father's situation is more important.
