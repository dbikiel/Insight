A brash stranger and his sheep arrive in a small town, but not soon after, the townspeople decide they've seen enough of him.
A stranger in a Western cattle-town behaves with remarkable self-assurance, establishing himself as a man to be reckoned with. The reason appears with his stock: a herd of sheep, which he intends to graze on the range. The horrified inhabitants decide to run him out at all costs.
In The Sheepman, Glenn Ford arrives at a small, western town controlled by Leslie Neilson.
There is a backstory between them, including events that led to the shooting death of Ford's fiancé.
Ford brings a trainload of sheep, which the town abhors, and Neilson uses the townfolk to harass and attack Ford. Shirley MacLaine is the fiancé of Neilson, who pretends to befriend Ford before participating in the ruse
that runs him out of town, temporarily. Ford with his sidekick, Pedro Gonzalez-Gonzalez, return to win the ensuing shootout. As a bonus, Ford gets a one-on-one showdown with his fiancé's killer - played by Pernell Roberts. Then it's on to Neilson's compound and another shootout, emerging victorious again.
Ford wins a draw with Neilson in his house, then comes out to the porch, announcing to the rest of his
men - "he's dead". They ask, "how do we know?" Ford replies, "'cause I'm alive".
After betraying Ford, MacLaine sees through Neilson and comes to Ford's aid.
As an ending , she and Ford ride off together in a wagon, with the townspeople looking on approvingly.
