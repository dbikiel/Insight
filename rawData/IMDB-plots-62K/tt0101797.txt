3 teen boys, part of a boy scout troop on a WA wilderness trip, find boxes of US Army weapons. They take a box of SAMs. Some well armed men want them back and it's hunting season on boy scouts.
A group of scouts stumble onto a cache of stolen weapons hidden in a forest. They meet up with a girl and get involved with the men who originally stole the weapons. The men try to shoot the scouts every time - but are thwarted at the end.
