Fitness trainer/former marriage counselor Molly White (Pascale Hutton) runs Bridal Boot Camp classes combining fitness and yoga with pre-marital counseling exercises to brides and grooms before their big day. While struggling with marital issues from her past, Molly meets the handsome Nick Dyson (Kavan Smith), a talented photographer who seems to be having doubts about his upcoming marriage to Molly's client, an overbearing perfectionist. While helping couples find their happiness and begin their new lives together, Molly discovers she, too, needs to learn how to forgive herself from her past so she can move forward with life - and love - in her future.
