Two old pals reunite for a camping trip in Oregon's Cascade Mountains.
Two old friends, Mark and Kurt, spend a weekend camping in the Cascade Mountains as each faces a turning point in their life. The strain is visible on both of them.Mark's partner, Tanya, is pregnant, and he will soon face real-world challenges and responsibilities, possibly for the first time. Kurt continues to drift in his old hippie-like ways; his life direction changes based on hunches, dreams, vibes, and the search for cool places. Soon Kurt needs to find a new place to live, but seems to have no plan, direction, or money.This weekend may mark a milepost where Mark and Kurt leave their sometimes rocky past behind and each head for an uncertain future.
