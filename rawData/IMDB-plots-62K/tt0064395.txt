A Mexican revolutionary hires an American gunslinger to organize the rescue of their leader from a brutal Army prison.
With six of the original Seven decimated after the life-altering events in The Magnificent Seven (1960) and Return of the Seven (1966), the team's sole survivor, Chris Adams, is recruited to free the incarcerated Mexican revolutionary, Quintero. As the rebels do battle with the ruthless dictator, Diaz, and his pitiless right-hand man, Colonel Diego, legendary Chris enlists the help of a lethal sextet of professional gunfighters to rescue the brave leader of the Revolution. Now, once more, Chris' men are called in to save the day. Can the outnumbered Magnificent Seven pull off a glorious victory?
