ABE is a tense, psychological horror about a robot who's looking for love in all the wrong places.
What if a machine, an automaton or a high-tech synthetic android could learn how to love, furthermore, what if a cold robot could sense and have emotions? With this in mind, Abe is programmed to love, and in return, it wants to be loved back. However, when all efforts to connect with its human object of desire fall short, rejection simply does not compute. Can rejection lead to jealousy and then to hatred when Abe's love is scorned?
