Runyonesque crooks on the lam hide out on blind man's pastoral farm and decide to go straight.
A group of criminals on the run hide out in an abandoned farmhouse. They find themselves being "looked after" by a friendly dog, and soon afterwards they meet up with a blind man and his young daughter, and they begin to rethink the direction their life has been taking them.
Naive Pennsylvanian Nick Allen comes to the aid of gangster's moll Jo Elliot when she's accosted on the street, and is shot for his troubles. As a result of his gallantry, he becomes innocently involved with the notorious Capper Regan gang. When Runyonesque gang members Spudsy and Red take it on the lam with moll Jo, Nick goes along. Car troubles force the quartet to stay at a farmhouse owned by blind man Pop Adams, and in the weeks that follow they realize that this pastoral lifestyle is much more rewarding than their previous criminal careers. Additionally, Nick falls in love with Adams' daughter Linda while Jo romances the local mayor. A rehabilitated Red and Spudsy resist returning to their old life and vow to go straight after a short prison term, and after Nick captures Capper for police, he happily returns to Linda and the farm
