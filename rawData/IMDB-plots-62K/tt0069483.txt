Two quirky Manhattanites crash into each other at an ophthalmologist's office. Peter is a grouchy cartoonist/author whose vision is failing; divorced mother Theresa is also reluctant to plunge into a relationship right now. It's not love at first sight - both have their eyes dilated, plus Peter constantly lampoons women in his work, which bookseller Theresa knows well. Loosely based on James Thurber's drawings "The War Between Men and Women," and his life, the film features animated sequences.
