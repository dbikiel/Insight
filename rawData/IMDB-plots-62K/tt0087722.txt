In L.A., a young woman tries to uncover what led to the brutal murder of her old flame and who killed him.
Bank teller Betty has a crush on her tennis instructor Mike. They have a one night stand after which he keeps on promising to call, but never does. What she doesn't know is that he is secretly also a small time drug dealer. After his attempt to make a deal on another dealer's turf goes horribly wrong and the dealer threatens him, Mike decides to disappear for three months. He contacts Betty again, but she waits for him in vain as he's killed before they meet. She tries to find out what happened by asking around among his friends, which leads her straight into the underbelly of L.A.'s drug scene, and puts her in grave danger. She also discovers that Mike had one more secret.
