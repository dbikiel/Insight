Leif Garrett as a young foosball player who wants to earn the big dollars that will be used to play soccer in Europe by winning the foosball world championships.
Two foosball enthusiasts wishing to become professional soccer players in Europe develop a plan to raise enough money to finance their trip to Europe. Their plan is to work up the ladder through local foosball tournaments to the grand $50,000 World Championships in Tahoe. In the course of events one boy suffers a broken hand and is replaced by a hot shot female foosball player. The other boy falls in love with a French girl he meets. Ultimately the foursome winds up headed for the World Championships at the casino in Lake Tahoe. With parents and security guards hot on their trail, the pressure builds to a foosball tournament climax.
