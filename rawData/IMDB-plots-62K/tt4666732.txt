"A Man Called Jon" is a light-hearted dramedy about Pastor Jon Terrell Carson's unusual style of worship. Jon's church is very traditional and not accustomed to outbursts during service. One day after Jon embarrasses the church along with his family, Senior Pastor Stannum decides to reach out to the Bishop requesting that Jon be assigned to a church more suited to his praise style. Jon and his family find themselves at an African American Church where he is confronted by Associate Pastor Dickens, who later informs him that a paperwork mix-up sent him to the wrong church. Jon is moved to his third church where he struggles to fit in. Will Jon be able to control his celebration or will he be moved for a fourth time?
