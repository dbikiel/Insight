Three Sioux Indians perform a 'buffalo dance', while two others use drums to supply a rhythm. The three dancers move around in a circle as they perform the various actions that are part of the dance.
Two drummers are seated near the back edge of a small wooden stage behind three warriors in full costumes. As the musicians play and chant, the three men dance, always moving their feet, in a counterclockwise circle. They often look at the camera, seeming to seek the spotlight. The each wear feathers in their headband and two wear decorative tails.
