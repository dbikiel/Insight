The Marx Brothers are employed at a hotel in postwar Casablanca, where a ring of Nazis is trying to recover a cache of stolen treasure.
In post-war Casablanca, Ronald Kornblow is hired to run a hotel whose previous managers have all wound up being murdered. French soldier Pierre suspects the involvement of ex-Nazis, specifically Count Pfefferman, in reality the notorious Heinrich Stubel. But Pierre himself is accused of collaborating with the enemy, and attempts to clear his name with the help of his girlfriend Annette and cagey buddy Corbaccio. They enlist the aid of Pfefferman's beleaguered mute valet, Rusty, and discover a hoard of war booty the Nazis have cached in the hotel.
When the manager of the Casablanca Hotel is murdered - the third to be killed in a year - the Governor and Chief of Police decide to bring in an experienced man, Ronald Kornblow, to run the establishment. Lt. Pierre Delmar is convinced that he knows the reasons for the murders - that there is a hoard of Nazi loot hidden in the hotel. As Kornblow and his zany friends turn the hotel on its head, the mysterious Count Pfferman arranges for the loot to transferred.
