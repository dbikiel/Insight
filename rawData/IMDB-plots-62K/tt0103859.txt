A successful executive and womanizer finds his lifestyle choices have turned back on him when his new female boss turns out to be an even bigger deviant than he is.
Marcus is a successful advertising executive who woos and beds women almost at will. After a company merger, he finds that his new boss, the ravishing Jacqueline, is treating him in exactly the same way. Completely traumatized by this, his work goes badly downhill. But then, Jacqueline's more quietly attractive assistant, Angela, who has been dating Marcus' best friend, shows herself more than a little concerned by his perilous state.
Suave, irresistible, and self-confident, the successful New York City cosmetics firm executive, Marcus Graham, lives a bachelor's dream life. Refusing to settle down and get married, Marcus will meet his match in the person of his new equally evasive and utterly ambitious boss, Jacqueline, who is in the habit of playing with men. Now--as, more and more, the self-assured advertiser gets a taste of his own medicine--Marcus needs to re-evaluate his life and the way he treats women if he wants to experience what he is truly after: an unrestrained passion and, above all, true love. However, is he capable of change?
