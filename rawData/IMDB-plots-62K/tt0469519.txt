Park takes place all in one day in a public park in Los Angeles, as 11 disaffected Angelenos find both love and loss in unexpected ways.
It's noon at a remote foothill park in Los Angeles: April is there to commit suicide; Krysta and Dennis tryst in his car while her co-worker Ian waits in a dog-shampooing van; Dennis's wife Peg and her best friend Claire have followed Dennis and plan guerrilla warfare; and four 20-somethings from the same office are talking in a van. April seeks Ian's help (lubricant, a hose, a lighter) and he asks if he can join her; Claire and Peg trap the lovers in Dennis's car then have a heart to heart; Nathan and Babar disclose to Meredith and Cheryl that they are nudists while Meredith insists the men are gay. Disrobing and disclosures follow. Is it just another day in L.A.?
During their lunch break, twelve offbeat characters converge on a secluded public park in the hills above Los Angeles. APRIL (Dagney Kerry) arrives first with the intention of killing herself, but every time she tries, she fails, which only frustrates her more. Meanwhile, in a nearby pet grooming mobile, IAN (David Fenner) is infatuated with his fellow groomer KRYSTA (Izabella Miko) but is crushed to realize she is planning a kinky rendezvous with a smug attorney named DENNIS (William Baldwin).Next, Denniss wife PEGGY (Ricki Lake) and her best friend CLAIRE (Cheri Oteri) arrive to punish and humiliate Dennis, while in a nearby van, NATHAN (Trent Ford) and BABAR (Maulik Pancholy) decide to prove to their female co-workers, MEREDITH (Anne Dudek) and SHERYL (Melanie Lynskey), that they enjoy eating their lunches naked. 	Sex, love, suicide, betrayal, nudism, sushi and dog grooming -- and you thought it was just a quiet little park.
