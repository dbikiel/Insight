With his wife and daughter being held hostage, a seasoned ex-military man is involved in a shady smuggling operation to save his family.
Joe Martin, a quiet American, lives a quiet life in the South of France renting boats to tourists. He is happily married to Fabienne and has a twelve-year-old daughter named Michèle. But the quiet man has a past: ten years before, Joe (then Moran) had escaped with four other convicts, among whom the sadistic ex-mercenary Katanga. Seeing the latter brutally kill an M. P., Joe had abandoned his accomplices and left with the car. One night, Captain Ross, Katanga, Whitey and Fausto re-appear..
Under a new name and a new identity, the seasoned former military man, Joe Martin, tries to live a simple life with his wife Fabienne and their twelve-year-old daughter, Michèle, running a fishing-boat business for tourists, somewhere in the South of France. However, Joe's well-hidden past will come back to haunt him when three old associates show up for revenge, after taking the fall for a murder back in Germany, years ago. Now, the ruthless gang wants to involve Joe in a shady smuggling operation, using his wife and daughter--who are being held hostage at gunpoint--as leverage. Inevitably, Joe must cooperate to save his family, but with the bullets flying everywhere, will he make it in time?
