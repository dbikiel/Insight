Motivated by Box Office statistics, Dax Shepard has made a decision to leave comedy to pursue his dream of becoming an international Martial Arts action star.
Comedic actor Dax Shepard wants to change genres: with friend and producer Nate Tuck, he concocts a concept for an action film featuring martial arts. They drop in on Ashton Kutcher to see if he'll co-star, ask Jon Favreau to direct, and seek advice from Tom Arnold (because he was in "True Lies"). The road to a green light is rough, full of stops and cul-de-sacs. Along the way there's a front-yard wrestling match with Bradley Cooper and David Koechner, back stories on other Shepard/Tuck ventures, and a rupture in a life-long friendship. Can Dax get his kung-fu movie made in spite of rejection?
Brother's Justice, follows actor Dax Shepard as he tries to radically change the direction of his career.  Known as a comedian, Dax is met with strong opposition while trying to secure financing for his martial arts film.  With maniacal conviction, he takes a bizarre path that becomes increasingly nonsensical and destructive, exploiting every relationship he has along the way.
