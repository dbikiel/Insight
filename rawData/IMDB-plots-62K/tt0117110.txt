The Muppets are back in action as they sail the high seas in their own twist of the classic tale by Robert Louis Stevenson. Having heard the legend of Captain Flint's massive treasure, young cabin boy Jim Hawkins (Kevin Bishop), along with The Great Gonzo (Dave Goelz) and Rizzo the Rat (Steve Whitmire) set out on a frantic search for it on a mysterious island. Accompanied by Squire Trelawney (Fozzie Bear) (Frank Oz) and Captain Smollett (Kermit the Frog) (Steve Whitmire), Jim and his friends finally get their own taste of adventure. But they soon uncover a sinister plot by a band of villainous pirates who seek the treasure for their own led by the ship's devious cook Long John Silver (Tim Curry). Once on the island, they find it is full of danger including an inhabitant named Benjamina Gunn (Miss Piggy) (Frank Oz).
After telling the story of Flint's last journey to young Jim Hawkins (Kevin Bishop), Billy Bones (Sir Billy Connolly) has a heart attack and dies just as Jim and his friends are attacked by pirates. The gang escapes into the town where they convince Squire Trelawney (Fozzie Bear) (Frank Oz) to hire out a boat and crew to find the hidden treasure, which was revealed by Bones before he died. On their voyage across the seas, they soon find out that not everyone on-board can be trusted.
