The true story of five young British freestyle footballers' journey across the Americas to Argentina in the hope of meeting their hero, Diego Maradona.
In the Hands of the Gods is the true story of five young British freestyle footballers journey across the Americas to Argentina in the hope of meeting their hero, Diego Maradona. This coming-of-age road movie tells the story of a group of young men in pursuit of a lifelong dream. The group of friends is made up of urban teenagers, most of whom have never been abroad before: a devout Christian, a cheeky scouser, a failed footballer, a pampered teenager and an asylum seeker from Somalia. These boys, ranging from 17 to 22 years old, represent the diversity and attitude of British youth today. For them, Diego Maradona epitomises everything they love about football; he is both the creator of their art and their inspiration during hard times in their lives. Along the way they found that it wasnt just Diego they were searching for, but something inside themselves With no money for food, accommodation or travel, the freestylers hustle and busk their way from London to Buenos Aires using only their football skills and their charm, often being forced to go hungry and to sleep rough. In the Hands of the Gods is a voyage of adventure and self-discovery that will take these boys far from their homes, on a trip that will change their lives forever.
