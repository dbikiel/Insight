Thanksgiving for the eccentric Turner clan turns into a train wreck when "insane" daughter Nina comes homes for the first time in 15 years.
A Thanksgiving get-together for the eccentric Turner clan goes from bad to worse when estranged daughter Nina makes a surprise visit home for the first time in 15 years. Nina clashes with her stepmother Deborah, and sister, Lindsay, while half-brother Jacob tries to keep a massive gambling debt a secret. Meanwhile, family patriarch Poppy has his own dramatic news to share. "Cold Turkey" is a black comedy about how - despite our best efforts - we all eventually turn into our parents. Starring Alicia Witt ("Friday Night Lights"), Cheryl Hines ("Curb Your Enthusiasm"), Sonya Walger ("Lost"), Victoria Tennant ("L.A. Story") and acclaimed writer-director Peter Bogdanovich ("The Last Picture Show").
