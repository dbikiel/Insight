The life and career of wildly controversial rock 'n' roll star Jerry Lee Lewis.
The story of Jerry Lee Lewis, arguably the greatest and certainly one of the wildest musicians of the 1950s. His arrogance, remarkable talent, and unconventional lifestyle often brought him into conflict with others in the industry, and even earned him the scorn and condemnation of the public. In 1956, Louisiana bad boy Jerry Lee Lewis moves to Memphis, determined to dethrone Elvis Presley with his ferocious, God-given talent. When Jerry Lee bangs out the chorus with his feet, huge fans howl out for more. When he finishes his performance by setting his piano ablaze, they mob the stage. But when he marries his 13-year-old cousin Myra Gale Brown...the scandal nearly destroys the Killer's career.
Sneaking with his cousin Jimmy Swaggart to check out the dancing people at the Chocolate Bar, Jerry Lee Lewis, for the first time hears the piano, playing in a style he soon learns to play. Now living with his cousin J.W. Brown, he meets 13-year-old Myra Gale Brown and they soon fall for each other. Now Jerry Lee is a rock star and decides to marry Myra, much to the anger and chagrin of her parents, which started his downfall. However, Jimmy's struggling career as a preacher (now-televangelist) keeps him in constant conflict with Jerry Lee's wild rock and roll career. The question is will Jerry Lee succeed, or will his young wife and his stubborn pride keep him from being the Killer himself?
