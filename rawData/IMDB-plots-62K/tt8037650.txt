Golsa, a 16 year old girl from suburb of Tehran, who is motivated primarily by boredom rather than greed, robs a corner shop with her friends. But while sharing the booty they are distressed to realize that they forgot to take the security camera footage. One of them must return to the crime scene to get it.
For Iranian teenager Golsa and her group of bored, upper-class friends, it seems like a bit of fun to rob a local corner shop. But the hi jinks quickly become serious when they realize they left behind security footage that could incriminate them. Bullied by her "friends" into retrieving the footage, Golsa hides it at her favorite place, the horse stables where she rides. Refusing to hand over the footage, Golsa is ostracized by her rich friends and finds herself at odds with her family; the stables become her only sanctuary. She must confront the hypocrisy and moral dilemmas of society, and try to right the wrongs she's had a hand in. An insightful tale of ethics, class division, rebellion and youth in modern Iran.
