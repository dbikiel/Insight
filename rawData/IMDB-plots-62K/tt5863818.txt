To a wicked queen's despair, her hunting-fond heir, prince Himmelbalu ('sky blue' in German), turns down every eligible aristocrat. Desperate, she turns to a witch imprisoned under the sorcery ban and promises her release if she gets the prince to find a bride. Accompanied on the hunt only by his loyal friend squire Fred, the prince is easily brought under a spell, but it's the vindictive witch's evil trick to render him oblivious and mean to all. Only fairy Lupine, who truly falls in love with him but is also brought under a cruelly coordinated half-time spell, and her devoted sister Elli can take on the sorcery magically, even if it's out of their league.
