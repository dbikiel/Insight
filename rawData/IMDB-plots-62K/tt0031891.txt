The Saint returns to London and with the help of an American pickpocket and a beautiful adventuress breaks a counterfeiting ring.
The Saint, newly back in London, is tipped by a friend in the Secret Service to a mystery involving one Bruno Lang, seemingly a Society card-sharp, but really involved in a plot to print and pass a million pounds worth of foreign currency. Also involved are various sinister characters; innocent victim Count Duni; the Saint's attractive admirer Penny Parker; and his old nemesis Inspector Teal.
The Saint, visiting in London, is tipped off by a friend in the British Intelligence, that there appears to something fishy going on regarding the representative of a foreign government who is in London arranging for the printing of paper currency for his country. A gang of crooks are trying to force the agent to give an additional order for the printing of millions in bank notes which are to be turned over to them. Fearing that The Saint is getting to close to their scheme, they kidnap his friend, Penny Parker, and are holding her hostage until The Saing turns over an incrimination document stolen from the home of the master-mind criminal.
