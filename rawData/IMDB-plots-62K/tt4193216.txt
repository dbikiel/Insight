Schmitke is an old German wind turbine engineer. One day, he is dispatched to the Czech side of the Ore Mountains to fix an old squeaking wind turbine. His colleague disappears and mysterious things begin to happen in the forest.
Julius Schmitke is a fifty-seven-year-old German wind turbine engineer. He feels ill and his body creaks, crunches and groans with age. One day, he is sent somewhere to the Czech side of the Ore Mountains to fix one of his old model, a C 174 turbine that, mysteriously, will not stop creaking and squeaking, just like his own body does. But this is not the only mystery that awaits him. His colleague disappears, strange things happen, and Schmitke starts to "feel" the spirit of the forest around him. The longer Julius wanders around the harsh and misty mountains, the more it surprises him that this entire expedition into the ominous and unknown jungle seems to be a return to old, familiar places within himself.
Julius Schmitke, a beaten-down, 67-year-old German engineer, has just arrived in a town on the Czech side of the Ore Mountains for the first time to perform the routine repair of an old wind turbine. He does not know, however, that within the rickety old machine awaits a trap from which he cannot escape. Despite his best efforts, Schmitke is unable to finish his repairs, and as time passes it seems that he will remain inexplicably imprisoned in these rugged, misty mountains. Though he does not realize that these attempts to escape from the town are in vain, in time he begins to feel alive again there - driving a motorcycle for the first time, befriending the eccentric residents, and encountering a peaceful forest spirit. He feels a deeper connection to the place, as though he has been there before, and little by little develops a sense of ancestral homeland. As Schmitke's soul fills with life again, so too do the Czech Ores, once abandoned, but now, slowly but surely, awakening.
