The Glenroy Brothers perform a portion of their vaudeville act, "The Comic View of Boxing: The Tramp &amp; the Athlete". The Athlete, dressed in bright white, comes after his opponent with a classic boxing style. But the Tramp, dressed in shabby dark clothes, has his own way of doing things. He turns cartwheels and performs other such antics, making it impossible for his opponent to anticipate his next move.
