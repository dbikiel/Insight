This is a documentary film about natural birth, and what it takes to give birth consciously and gracefully. This film has spread to 58 countries by word of mouth and has received global recognition as the guide to Conscious birth. Now in the 6th edition the movie has been translated into 12 languages. In 2010 the film was added to the curriculum at the UN University for Peace and the International University of Monaco. In 2008 it became part of the mandatory curriculum of every medical school and University in Iran as one of only five foreign titles in their schools.
The film features 11 exquisite natural births: at home, in the sea, breech delivery, and home waterbirth of twins. Also included are interviews on topics rarely discussed: Limbic Imprint, Sexuality of childbirth, Cesarean-section, Circumcision, Lotus Birth, and Conscious Birth preparation. Viewers are given a rare opportunity to witness the true nature of birth, and the potential to give birth gracefully and fearlessly. With rich cinematography, invoking narrative and a breathtaking soundtrack, the film runs 73 minutes plus 3 hours of bonus material, including 'Director's Commentary' by Elena. There are also two short edits of the film (25 minutes and 40 minutes long), called the 'Educational Version', for time-limited classes and conference presentations.
