A man on a fishing trip with three of his friends receives a blow to the head that makes him lose his memory. Three years later it all comes back to him, but on the day it does one of the men who was on the trip with him turns up dead.
Philip Vickers mysteriously reappears to his wife and friends during a party at her upscale country estate after an absence of four years. He had been presumed dead after he disappeared on a fishing trip in Portugal with three friends. He was knocked unconscious and pushed overboard by an unknown assailant. In the interim, he had suffered from amnesia but now has regained his faculties. All the potential suspects, including his wife, are at the party. When one of them is killed, the police are called in, and suspicion for the crime falls on the vengeful Vickers.
Four years ago, four friends went to Portugal on a fishing trip, but only three came back. Now, long after he was presumed dead, Philip Vickers returns to his wife and three friends. But he can't trust any of them. Which of the three friends tried to murder him? Were all three in on it? Was his wife? And what about his wife's social secretary, who is none too happy to see him back? Philip Vickers is bitter, angry, cold and cynical, and he could be going mad. But he's determined to put an end to his nightmares and find out who tried to kill him and why.
