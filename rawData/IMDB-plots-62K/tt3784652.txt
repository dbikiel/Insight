Travel plans for three men in ill-fitting wedding tuxedos goes horribly wrong. A follow-up to the 2011 comedy 'A Few Best Men'.
A destination wedding in Australia's Blue Mountains goes horribly wrong when Luke gets drunk and falls off a cliff. Our boys, David , Tom and Graham suddenly find themselves transporting their friend's corpse back to London, where his grieving Aunt is already planning the funeral. When their private jet crash lands in the bush, the boys must carry the body across the treacherous landscape, contend with some fit ravers, a machete wielding mother and a mix up with a giant gold penis, in a race against time to return Luke home. Provided they all survive - intact.
