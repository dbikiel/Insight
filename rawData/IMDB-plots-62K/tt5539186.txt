The Amityville legend lives on when a resident of a local boarding house dies under mysterious circumstances.
The Amityville legend lives on when a resident of a local boarding house dies under mysterious circumstances. Her two best friends, Brigitta and Bermuda, Bermuda's sister Sentinel, and the owner of the boarding house, Ms. Ernie, are absolutely devastated. This is not helped by the arrival of an eccentric and crude detective who never takes off his cowboy outfit, Hank Denton. Tensions run high as the girls begin to suspect their friend Margaret may still be alive; and as the detective's behavior becomes more out of control, the house itself may very well be turning on it's residents.
Under very suspicious circumstances, an innocent young girl bleeds to death from her sliced wrists. Was it a suicide, or a staged act of despair? As the deceased's bosom friends in the boarding house--Bermuda, Brigitta, and Sentinel--along with the landlady, Ms Ernie, try to figure out what has happened, the FBI agent, Hank Denton, tries to shed light on this baffling case; however, in vain. Is there more to Hank than meets the eye? Are the remaining girls the next victims of the powerful Amityville curse?
