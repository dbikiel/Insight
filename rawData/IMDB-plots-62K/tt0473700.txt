A love story set during a tense encounter between a wagon train of settlers and a renegade Mormon group.
A story set against the Mountain Meadows Massacre, the film is based upon the tragedy which occurred in Utah in 1857. A group of settlers, traveling on wagons, was murdered by the native Mormons. All together, about 140 souls of men, women and children, were taken. Amidst this, two young lovers-to-be, one a Mormon and the other one of the doomed settlers from Arkansas, develop a relationship in an atmosphere of suspicion and rancor.

Jacob bade Jonathan to spy on the settlers as he sought the advice of church elders; when his fears were then confirmed by a visitation from God, Jacob relayed the order to Brigham Youngs adopted son, John D. Lee, to kill all but the youngest of the train.Desperate to stop the battle, Jonathan defied his church and tried in vain to warn the settlers and their wagon train leader, Captain Fancher. Unable to reach them in time, imprisoned by his own father, Jonathan watched in agony as his younger brother, Micha, became swept up by the bloody fanaticism.Wrenching free of his chains Jonathan raced to the slaughter site, only to be faced with an unbearable horror. Grief-stricken, Jonathans search for Emily brings him to a heart-wrenching choice of love over death.
