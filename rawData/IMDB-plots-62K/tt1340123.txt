A glue-sniffing boy and his girlfriend escape the government-controlled no-hope Aboriginal community they live in and go to the city, Alice Springs, looking for a better life.
Samson and Delilah's world is small- an isolated community in the Central Australian desert. When tragedy strikes they turn their backs on home and embark on a journey of survival. Lost, unwanted and alone they discover that life isn't always fair, but love never judges.
Two Australian Aboriginal kids travel in dark places in their bid for survival in this astoundingly affecting story from writer/director/cinematographer Warwick Thornton.In 2009, the film deservedly won the Cannes Film Festival Camera dOr award for best first feature film.Interestingly, Thornton gives young Delilah (Melissa Gibson) the hero's role. Petrol-sniffing Samson (Rowan McNamara) is the lost soul who needs to be saved. Delilah is seen as the nurturer of her Nana (Mitjili Gibson) and of Samson. She endures beating, humiliation, abduction and physical harm; but the smile on her face at the end of the film surmounts all that has gone before. Delilah is, after all, a survivor.This is one of the great Australian films, a beautiful love story that gives us insight into a hidden world.
