Two unemployed computer technicians discover 2 million euros next to a dead body in a field of windmills.
Two unemployed computer technicians discover 2 million euros next to a dead body in a field of windmills. The money that they find deepens their pre-existing dominator-dominated relationship. The next day, a young blind girl is found dead near the site of the discovery and it seems that the stolen money had been intended to pay her ransom. Another child is then kidnapped and the police carry out an investigation, in particular a young sergeant who is fascinated by the tragic event.
While on a joyride with the headlights turned off, two men hit and kill another man carrying a satchel full of money. The two men decide to take the money and throw the body into a pond and bury the money in a coal hill. The next morning the police discover the body of a kidnapped 12-year blind girl, Melody, in a warehouse near the site of the hit-and-run. They determine that the kidnapper saw the girl's father bringing the ransom to him and also witnessed the hit-and-run and the men stealing the ransom. The kidnapper kills the girl but poses her body with an odd smile and in clothing that resembles a popular doll. The autopsy reveals that the girl was gently strangled and had cedar chips in her shoes and wolf hair on her nightgown. Her scalp was also damaged apparently from someone constantly brushing her hair. The kidnapper left finger prints but with no ridges for identification.Two days later, another 12-year old girl is kidnapped. She is diabetic and only has enough medicine for 40 hours. The profiler thinks the kidnapper is the same man and is deriving some kind of pleasure from what he's doing.
