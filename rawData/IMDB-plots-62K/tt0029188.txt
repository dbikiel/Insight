Donald Duck continually heckles Mickey's magic act, but Mickey bests him at every turn.
Mickey is a stage magician, and Goofy is a stagehand. Donald is sitting in a box seat, and soon starts heckling. Mickey retaliates, among other things by making him spit out playing cards, which only makes Donald more angry and determined to heckle. Ultimately, Donald gets hold of Mickey's flare gun and literally brings the house down on all three of them.
