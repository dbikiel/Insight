An heiress seems to be cursed as each of her intended grooms meets with a horrible end.
Elinor Bentley Fairchild's previous three grooms-to-be have either died or been maimed. Her aunt hires Lucky Downing to become engaged to her for a month to break the curse. But Lucky becomes a target of what appears to be the ghost of one of the former fiances.
Elinor Fairchild, a wealthy, beautiful widow, described by the scandal sheets as "The Kiss of Death Girl," because the last three men she has been engaged to marry all met a violent death. For a stipulated amount of money, 'Lucky" Downing, a newly-graduated chemical engineer, agrees to 'be engaged' to her. Then, the mysterious "Smilin' Ghost" makes attempts on his life.
