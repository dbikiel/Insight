The story of an exiled Spanish revolutionary, now a successful screenwriter, dangerously drawn back to his homeland and the "good fight" for freedom from fascism.
Fathers and sons, and political exile. In the fall of 1975, Franco is dying but repression continues. Jules and Eve, living well in exile in France, continue to assist the resistance. The underground calls with a job for either, and Eve goes, to the disappointment of their son, Laurent, visiting his parents at their seaside place in Cherbourg and not getting on well with his father. When a road accident in Spain brings tragedy, the father and son's conflict worsens. After Laurent and his girlfriend, Julie, pay a harrowing visit to Jules, Julie stays, taking Jules as a lover. Revelations and admissions about Jules and Eve make way for new ground for Jules and Laurent.
