In an American town, an old bitter miser is given a ghostly chance at redemption on Christmas Eve.
In Depression-era New England, a miserly businessman named Benedict Slade receives a long-overdue attitude adjustment one Christmas eve when he is visited by three ghostly figures who resemble three of the people whose possessions Slade had seized to collect on unpaid loans. Assuming the roles of the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future from Charles Dickens' classic story, the three apparitions force Slade to face the consequences of his skinflint ways, and he becomes a caring, generous, amiable man.
Based in the depression era, a take on the "Christmas Carol" by Charles Dickens.
"Mr Benjamin Slade" as played by Henry Winkler, is the remaining owner of "S&amp;L Finance" after the death of his long time partner Jack Latham (Ken Pogue). Mr Slade and his assistant, "Mr Thatcher" (R.H. Thomson) make their rounds on Christmas eve to repossess items from the townspeople who have been unable to keep up with payments.
After a long day of collecting his "valuable merchandise", Mr Slade returns to his business, fires his sensitive assistant and then is confronted by his dead partner and three spirits in the form of the people he repossessed from that day. As he is taken through his past (as an orphan), the present (the family of his assistant) and his future, He is shown how his greed and desire for success has made him loose sight of the ones that loved him and made him enemies the town. Once confronted with the towns reaction to his future death and desolate grave site, he finally sees the true meaning of life, love and the Christmas spirit. Waking from his encounters, Mr Slade restores his assistant and together they return the needed items back to the surprise of the townfolk, and make everyones Christmas a joyful one.
