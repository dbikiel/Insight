Tromeo, a filmmaker, falls in love with Juliet, the daughter of a former partner who tried to steal his business from him.
A modern, punk adaptation of Shakespeare's classic. Told irreverently, this film attempts to impact the viewer in the same way theatre-goers were affected in Shakespeare's time. Bawdy, Violent, Humorous, and Romantic.
