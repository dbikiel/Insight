A documentary film focusing on customized vans and the quirky people that drive them.
Often thought of as the outcasts of the automotive world, Vanner's and their vans provide an extraordinary glimpse into a a subculture that saw it's rise and high-water mark in the late 1970's. The customized van was representative of a parent's worst nightmare and a young person's dream. But, just as fast as they rose in popularity, they faded; leaving only an echo on American pop culture. So what was and is Vannin' all about? In July of 2012, Andrew Morgan and Nick Nummerdor set out to answer that question and what resulted was a unique view into the lost sub-culture that is "Vannin'"
