A hedonistic soccer mom embarks on a strange journey of self discovery.
Claire, a suburban mother indulging in some good-natured hedonistic debauchery, one day, with a very sudden decision steals her 7-year-old son's friend's mother's car during their football practice and leaves her husband, Aaron and their son, George there. After having a one-night stand with a handsome hitch-hiker, the man steals the stolen car and disappears. She wants to return home as usual but her son doesn't want her to come back. To win back his affection, she decides to return a small rock half way around the world to its place of origin on a Mediterranean island. Along the way, she goes to work in a strange strip club on the edge of civilization where exotic dancers perform in an otherworldly space for abandoned souls just like her.
