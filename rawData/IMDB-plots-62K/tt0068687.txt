A newlywed man on his honeymoon has second thoughts about his marriage and falls for a different woman.
Three days into his Miami honeymoon, New York Jewish Lenny meets tall, blonde Kelly. This confirms him in his opinion that he has made a serious mistake and he decides he wants Kelly instead. Her rich father is less than keen and lets everyone - including Lenny - know that he hates everything about him and the way he is going on.
Jewish New Yorkers Lenny Cantrow and Lila Cantrow n√©e Kolodny have just gotten married. Their pre-marital life did not include sex with each other. On the three day drive from New York to Miami Beach, where they plan on spending their honeymoon, Lenny begins to be bothered by every little thing about Lila, which makes him wonder whether he made a mistake in marrying her. His belief that the marriage is a mistake is strengthened when he meets university student Kelly Corcoran in Miami Beach. A beautiful blonde Midwesterner on vacation in Miami Beach with her wealthy WASP parents, flirtatious but at the same time somewhat standoffish Kelly leads Lenny on. Lenny does whatever he can to ditch Lila at every opportunity - which by circumstance is easy to do at the beginning - to spend time with Kelly, who he believes he was meant to be with for life. As Lenny pursues Kelly in the hopes of eventually marrying her, three things stand in his way: the fact that he is already married to Lila; whether or not Kelly feels the same way or if this liaison is just a vacation fling and game to her; and Mr. Corcoran, who hates everything about Lenny with every fiber of his being.
