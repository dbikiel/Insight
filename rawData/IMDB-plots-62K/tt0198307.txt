A documentary following the chaotic 1982 Canadian and American tour of punk rock bands Youth Brigade and Social Distortion. What starts off as an idealistic Do-It-Yourself act of youth rebellion quickly becomes a metaphor for the clash between the anarchic punk rock idealism and the harsh realities of concert promotion and touring without any safety nets against the worst case scenario (injuries, tour bus trouble, not getting paid for the gig, etc).
