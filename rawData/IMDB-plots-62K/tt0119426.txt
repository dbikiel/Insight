The teenage son of a motel owner steals a black convertible to impress a mysterious beauty he has a crush on.
To a dumpy motel in an out-of-the-way little town, a mysterious woman, calling herself only Ms. Smith, comes to stay. Not only is she stunningly lovely, but her big black convertible is a beaut. J.T., the just-out-of-high-school son of the motel's owner, is taken by the car, and in an attempt to liven up his dull life, and possibly to impress Tanya, a hotel guest who flirts with him and wants to be a model, he steals the car.
