A quirky twist on the vampire tale, set in modern day corporate America.
An offbeat hilarious comedy with a quirky twist on the vampire tale set in modern day corporate America. Employees of Berm-Tech Industries, Inc. have kept the family secret for a long time. For years it has been business as usual, until the top vampire in charge contracts a dreaded disease, becomes senile forgetting that he s a vampire and starts killing off other vampire colleagues. A human efficiency expert and "Dead Mike's" replacement are invited to work at Berm-Tech but soon they discover that some of their associates are not what they appear to be.
