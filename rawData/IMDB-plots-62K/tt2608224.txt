In a small Turkish town, two young tuberculous poets try to survive while publishing their poems. As they both fall in love, their life would never be the same.
Last days of 1941 summer, the era of Obligation, during the famine atmosphere of the Second World War. In the middle of all this poverty and turmoil, there are two poets in their early twenties: Muzaffer Tayyip Uslu and Rustu Onur. They have been carrying tuberculosis germs in their lungs and love of poetry in their hearts for years. Two poets who have the constant habit of making bets on things that they do not own, make a bet on a beautiful girl. They will both write a poem for her and whichever Suzan likes, the other will fade from the scene..
1941, Zonguldak, Turkey. Under the heavy burden of World War 2, due to Obligation Law, all men between the ages 15-65 within Zonguldak and its adjacent towns are obligated to work in the mines. In the center of this turmoil, there are two poets who are in their early twenties: Muzaffer Tayyip Uslu and Rustu Onur. Their biggest dream is to get their poems published in Varlik literary magazine and become famous poets. Meanwhile Behcet Necatigil, literature teacher of Zonguldak Celikel High School is the only person who is mentoring, understanding and befriending them. When they set eyes on Suzan, the daughter of a prominent rich businessman of town, her beauty mesmerizes the young poets. They make a bet; both will write a poem and hand it over to her to have her read. Depending on whose poem Suzan likes the most; the other will step aside.
