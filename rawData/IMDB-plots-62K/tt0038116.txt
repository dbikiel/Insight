The Frake family attends the annual Iowa State Fair; each member of the clan has their own reason for doing so.
Farm family Frake, with discontented daughter Margy, head for the Iowa State Fair. On the first day, both Margy and brother Wayne meet attractive new flames; so does father's prize hog, Blue Boy. As the fair proceeds, so do the romances; must lovers separate when the fair closes?
The Frakes - father Abel Frake, mother Melissa Frake, and young adult children Wayne Frake and Margy Frake - are an Iowa farm family getting ready to go to the multi-day Iowa State Fair. Wayne isn't looking forward to going as his girlfriend Eleanor can't go. And Margy is just preoccupied with the thought of being in a relationship with a real man, instead of the courtship she has with the boorish Harry Ware to whom she is unofficially engaged. At the fair, Melissa is hoping she made the right decision regarding the mincemeat she has entered for judging. And Abel may have some problems with his potentially prize winning boar, Blueboy, who has a case of love-sickness. Also love struck are Wayne and Margy, Wayne with a big band singer named Emily Edwards who is performing at the fair, and Margy with Pat Gilbert, a Des Moines Register reporter who is covering the fair for the newspaper. Can both the Frake children's romances extend beyond the length of the fair, especially considering their big city versus farm life differences, Emily's which takes her across the country to perform, and Pat's which may take him to a more lucrative job as a columnist job with a prestigious Chicago newspaper?
