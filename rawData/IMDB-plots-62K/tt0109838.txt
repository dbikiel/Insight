A vain actor, his best friend, and an activist end up at a mutant freak farm run by a weirdo scientist.
A company that produces a toxic chemical tries to improve its image via a popular spokesperson, Ricky Coogan. Ricky travels to South America to get a first-hand look at the chemical's effects and finds himself at a mutant freak farm. Elijah, who runs the farm, is only too happy to have new subjects on which to try his freak machine. The very chemical that Ricky is supposed to promote is the one responsible for creating the great variety of freaks.
The TV journalist Skye Daley hosts the boastful actor Ricky Coogan to tell his recent adventure in Central America. Ricky accepts to promote the toxic fertilizer Zygrot 24 from the E.E.S. Corporation in Santa Flan; in return, he would receive US$ 5,000,000 from the corrupt E.E.S. Chairman Dick Brian. He travels with his best friend Ernie to Santa Flan and on the arrival, they meet the gorgeous Julie, who is protesting against the Zygrot 24. Ricky lures her telling that Ernie and he are protesters and she joins the two friends in a trip to the E.E.S. Soon she discovers the truth but they are in the middle of nowhere and she goes with them. They decide to take a detour to see the Freakland Carnival and they meet the owner Elijah C. Skuggs and his henchman Toad. Soon they learn that Skuggs is an insane genius that uses a machine that processes the Zygrot 24 to transform normal people into hideous mutants to work in his sideshow. Ricky is transformed in a monster and Julie and Ernie are merged in conjoined monsters. What will happen to our heroes?
