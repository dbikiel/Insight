Following the disappearance of his wife, a man finds himself on a dark and twisted trail of discovery through the labyrinthine halls of his apartment building. Led on a wild goose chase by cryptic messages from his mysterious neighbours, he becomes entangled in a hellish nightmare as he unlocks their strange fantasies of sensuality and bloodshed. The Strange Colour Of Your Body's Tears is a visually dazzling experience from the creators of Amer that takes you on a journey into mystery and blood soaked terror that you will never forget.
Eager to return home from a long business trip, Dan Kristensen arrives at his apartment, only to discover that his wife, Edwige, is missing, without any clear signs of violence. Did Edwige leave, or is she in grave danger? As Dan delves deeper and deeper into an obscure and surreal kaleidoscope of half-baked leads trying to rationalise the baffling conditions of his wife's disappearance, this intensive but fruitless investigation will gradually lead to a nightmarish realm of seduction, deceit, and murder. Does anyone in the building know something?
