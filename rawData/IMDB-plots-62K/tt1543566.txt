A coming of age comedy about a group of twenty something 'Gen Y'-ers who reunite for a New Year's Eve bash in middle-class suburbia. Numbed by the nine to five conformity of real life after university, the party provides a welcome escape full of drinking, smoking, making out, and bag tag. But when a near-death experience from the past week, an unwanted pregnancy, and the appearance of past rivals disrupt their night of glory, each are forced to take a crash course in growing up.
