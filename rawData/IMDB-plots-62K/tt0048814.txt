Brady Sutton returns from three years in prison and tries to go straight. One a member of the Butch Cassidy gang, he is still suspected of being cahoots with them. When Cassidy and his men rob the bank, he is blamed. Escaping from the townspeople, he once again joins up with Cassidy to wait for a chance to help bring him in.
Reformed banding Brady Sutton ( Philip Carey) again becomes involved with outlaws Butch Cassidy (Gene Evans) and Sundance (William Bishop) even while trying to go straight with the help of his girlfriend Nancy (Martha Hyer). Cassidy and Sundance dupe the townsmen into leaving and they ride in and rob the bank and leave evidence to indicate Sutton was involved.
