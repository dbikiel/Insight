A group of young filmmakers have one goal in mind: to track down and interview the great writer/director John Hughes, responsible for many of the classic teen films that marked a whole generation even today such as The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller Day-Off and Sixteen Candles. The documentary features testimonies from many actors who worked with Hughes, revealing what was special about his films and the way they conquered audiences through the years.
How did John Hughes capture the growing pains of adolescence so perfectly? Why do his films resonate with those that grew up with them, and those that have just discovered them? Why did he leave? Armed with those and many other questions, a documentary was put into production. It wasn't long before interviews with Hughes alumni (Ally Sheedy, Judd Nelson, Andrew McCarthy) and those influenced by Hughes (Kevin Smith, Jason Reitman) transpired, shedding light on Hughes and his work. However, after 2 years of compiling hundreds of interviews there was still a very important one missing: John Hughes'. Don't You Forget About Me cuts insightful and entertaining interviews with the honest, humorous, and tension filled road trip the neophyte filmmakers make to Chicago, hoping to secure an interview with the reclusive director and closure for themselves.
