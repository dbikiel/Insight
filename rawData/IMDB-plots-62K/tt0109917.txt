A brash 22-year-old FBI agent trumps up charges of Communist spying against a Chinese laundryman. Ten years later, he wants to make amends to the man and his teenage daughter.
Fresh out of law school, Kevin Walker is recruited into the FBI and commissioned to root out communist subversives amongst the San Francisco Chinese community. He finds a loophole that will enable him to prosecute, but his loyalties become divided when he falls in love with Marilyn, a laundryman's daughter.
