Mimi has tried everything to become the bride to Alan, but he chooses Elizabeth instead. The ironic part is that Mimi's mother writes romance novels and neither one has had any luck with men. So Mimi decides to get a job as an illustrator at the New York Chronicle where her friend Jimmy works. When Alan and Liz return from their honeymoon, Alan wants to keep Mimi at his side, and Mimi has no objections - in the beginning.
