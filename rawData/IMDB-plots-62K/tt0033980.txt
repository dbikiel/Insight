Episodic look at the life of a minister and his family as they move from one parish to another.
In the early twentieth century, William Spence and Hope Morris Spence are a Methodist minister and his wife. From Central Canada, William forwent his medical school education in Toronto to become a minister, much to the chagrin of Hope's well off parents of Stratford, Ontario. Regardless of the unknowns of their first posting in rural Iowa, the only posting available, Hope married William in 1904. The adjustment to their new life was initially more difficult for Hope, especially their new poor economic standing and having their life not wholly being their own but rather that of their congregation, as William had the focus of this decision on which to drive his purpose. Their life over the next twenty years or so is presented, which eventually includes three children and they being constantly on the move as William gets assigned from one parish to another across the United States. That life is largely characterized by William having a strong mindset, but who will admittedly change his mind if he is proven to be wrong, and Hope generally supporting William in his decisions regardless of the sacrifice to her or the children. The only seeming exception to that latter point is Hope's desire ultimately to settle into one place that they can call home to provide them, especially the children, with a sense of belonging. They believe they've found that place when they move into a parish in Denver following the great war, with a booming economy one that has the money to accomplish what William would like to accomplish for his work in the name of God. William will however find that with money among his congregation comes a sense of entitlement which may not mesh with his view of bringing the teachings of God to the people.
