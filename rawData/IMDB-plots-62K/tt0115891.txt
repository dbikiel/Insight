Billy Jackson is not having a good Christmas. He got a basketball and just can't make a jump shot. His Uncle David is coming to town to open a Valu-Mall, which will put his dad's store out of business. When he tells his little sister Sarah that there is no Santa, she makes a wish that it would be Christmas every day. Now he must relive Christmas Day over and over again.
Billy Jackson, a miserable 16-year old, hates Christmas. From his little sister to local bully Joey Mancuso, he is not fond of his hometown of Greenwood Falls. Until he learns the true meaning of Christmas, Billy must relive this holiday over and over until he gets it.
