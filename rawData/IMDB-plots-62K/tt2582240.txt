From a meager beginning to owning a thriving air charter service, the Taylors devoted their lives to their children Chris (Cameron Deane Stewart) and Grace (Savannah McReynolds). Raising them with a solid foundation of faith, they taught them through example to love others and give to their community. Their passion was volunteering and financially supporting the local youth shelter. However when tragedy strikes, Chris turns his back on his faith and the shelter. His choices are leading to destruction unless he changes his ways. Will an unlikely visit save what is about to be lost?
