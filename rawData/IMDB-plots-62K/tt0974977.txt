Driven by biological excess, a man and a woman search for sexual fulfillment, unaware of each other's existence. They eventually meet.
A warped love story about a fashion photographer with an mutated sex organ who meets a man with a truly magnificent tool. Jennifer (Charlee Danielson) is a shutterbug who specializes in edgy imagery. Her sex drive is always in the red, and she likes to ride bareback. She's also prone to killing her lovers during intense bouts in the bedroom. When she gets pregnant - which happens quite frequently - her rapid metabolism causes her to birth malformed infants in a matter of minutes. Sexually frustrated by the fact that she can't find a man who can truly please her, she is elated when she happens across Batz (Anthony Sneed), a man who keeps his monstrous organ under control by injecting it with lethal amounts of animal tranquilizers. He too has been having a rather difficult time finding a compatible mate, but when these two get together it's a match made in mutant heaven.
