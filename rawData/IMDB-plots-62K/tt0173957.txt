Four young men fall in love with the same woman and struggle to keep their pact with each other not to woo her.
Gabrielle Anwar stars in the romantic comedy DADDY WHO? (aka KIMBERLY). She plays Kimberly, an English girl and daughter of an Olympic rower, who agrees to coach an inept rowing team. The four guys on the team all agree not to try and woo the beautiful Kimberly, but each does so anyway. However, when she ends up pregnant and no one knows which one of them is the father, they all agree to help prepare for the baby's arrival. United by the prospect of fatherhood, the team is able to train for their rowing competition and, along with Kimberly, become a close knit family.
