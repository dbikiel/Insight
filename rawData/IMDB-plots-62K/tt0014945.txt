A shy, young man, who is completely incapable of talking to women, decides to write a book that details to other bachelors how to find a girlfriend.
Harold Meadows (Lloyd) is a shy, stuttering bachelor working in a tailor shop, who is writing a guide book for other bashful young men, "The Secret of Making Love," chapters from which are portrayed as fantasy sequences. Fate has him meet rich girl, Mary (Ralston), and they fall in love. But she is about to wed an already married man, so our hero embarks upon a hair-raising daredevil ride to prevent the wedding.
Harold Meadows works as an apprentice in his Uncle Jerry's tailor shop in Little Bend, California. Harold is so shy around girls, that he can't speak to them without stuttering. Regardless, Harold has written a yet unpublished manuscript, it being what he mistakenly believes is the definitive guide on how to attract different types of women, each situation which he passes off as actually being his own experience, which may be only true in his fantasies. On his way to the office of publisher Roger Thornsby, Harold meets the wealthy Mary Buckingham. Because of the situation, Harold is able to speak to her without stuttering. The two end up falling in love with each other, although their feelings are initially unknown to the other. While Harold continually dreams of Mary, Mary continually drives through Little Bend in hopes of running into Harold, despite or largely because she is pursued by Ronald DeVore, to whose marriage proposals she has always said no. When Harold learns unofficially that his manuscript has been declined by Thornsby, Mary decides to marry Ronald if only because Harold now feigns disinterest in her, unknowingly to her if only because he feels he is not in her league due to the manuscript not being published. But when new information comes to light on the day of the wedding, Harold does whatever he can to stop Mary from marrying Ronald, while getting the girl for himself.
