The flightless birds and scheming green pigs take their feud to the next level.
After saving Bird Island from an all-out green-pig invasion in Angry Birds (2016), the isle's always cranky local hero, Red, still finds himself doing battle with Pig Island. As the prank war between pigs and birds is raging, massive icy projectiles coming from the feathery tyrant Zeta's ice-capped Eagle Island threaten the security of both havens, unless Red and King Leonard agree to form a difficult but honest truce. Now, Red, Bomb, Mighty Eagle, Chuck, and his brilliant sister, Silver, have to join forces with Leonard's mighty porcine team to thwart the megalomaniac Zeta's bold schemes for world domination. However, is Red capable of change?
