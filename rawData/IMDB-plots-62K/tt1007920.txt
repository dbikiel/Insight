In anticipation of the season's first magical rainbow after the events in Barbie Fairytopia: Mermaidia (2006), Elina and her pet-friend, Bibble, travel to wondrous Fairytopia's renowned School of Fairies, where, as a chosen apprentice, she will learn how to perform the whimsical Flight of Spring. There, at the elegant Crystal Palace, Elina along with six other eager apprentices, they will improve their skills in magic, and learn how to combine flying with dancing.
