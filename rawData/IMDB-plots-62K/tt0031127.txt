A series of identical accidents kills racing drivers, but a dim-witted mechanic suspects they were not accidents.
Racing car enthusiast Jerry O'Connor and his dim-witted mechanic, Buddy Buttle, get their chance to join the crew of race car builder Pinky Delano, who just suffered a setback when one of his drivers was killed by failing to make a turn on the track. Then, one by one, his other drivers suffer the same fate, until it is Jerry's turn to drive in the big race. Buddy tries an experiment and determines these were no accidents but is it too late to help Jerry, who has started the race?
Jerry O'Connor and his pal, "Buddy" Buttle, quit their farm jobs and head out with a renovated midget-car racer to start their car-racing careers, with Jerry as a driver and "Buddy" as his mechanic. On the way to the track, Jerry's reckless driving causes Jane Delano to crash her car, but her father, race-car owner P. G. "Pinky" Dalano, sees Jerry break a track record in his first race and hires him to drive one of his cars for him. In the Indianapolis 500, driver Jose "Rocks' Rivera is killed when he suddenly goes blind and crashes. Two more of Delano's drivers, Hank Hogan and "Lefty" Simmons, are killed in following races when they also go blind during the race. So, cocky O'Connor, figuring it is his turn next, practices driving while blindfolded, "counting" as he drives. During the Grand Prix race, Buddy figures out who and why somebody had been putting poison eye-wash in the eyes of Delano's drivers, but O'Connor is already driving blindly around the track...but "counting' as he goes.
