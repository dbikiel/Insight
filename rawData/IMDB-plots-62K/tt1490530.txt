Alma, a little girl, skips through the snow-covered streets of a small town. Her attention is caught by a strange doll in an antique toy shop window. Fascinated, Alma decides to enter.
In the middle of a cold white winter, little Alma wandering up and down Barcelona's cobblestone streets, unexpectedly, she stumbles upon an out-of-the-way unobtrusive toy shop. Next to it, a wall with various names scribbled on it, which in Alma's bright eyes seems sleek and towering and utterly inviting. So without much thought, the girl puts effort into writing her name in flawless cursive, when all of a sudden, an almost perfect miniature image of herself appears, staring at her through the storefront window. And then, as if by magic, the shop's door opens, welcoming the awed girl to witness firsthand the wonders inside the small and crammed with toys store. Nevertheless, Alma's elusive twin is nowhere to be found.
