A delinquent girl involves an innocent friend in an armed robbery followed by a jail-break and hostage-taking with her equally delinquent boyfriend.
A propaganda film intended to highlight the growing problem of juvenile crime. Jane Koberly, present during a robbery, is falsely convicted of being an accessory. While being taken with her companion, Terry Marsh, to an industrial school on the week of Thanksgiving, Terry's boyfriend springs them both. With the police hot on their tail, they take over a farmhouse and terrorize the family within (the Grants) while waiting for a co-conspirator to arrive with money and transport. While waiting, the boyfriend becomes more psychotic as Terry starts putting the moves on the Grants's son (to make some kind of point), and Mr. Grant takes solace from the Bible.
17-year-old Jane Koberly is at the scene of a hold-up committed by Terry Marsh, Mike Denton and Al. Mike and Al escape. Although innocent, Jane is convicted of the robbery, and she and Trry are sentenced to a juvenile correction home. A guard and a matron are assigned to drive the girls to the home, but they are intercepted by Mike who kills the guard. Janes is forced to accompany the criminals as they escape and then wreck their car. They take refuge at the farm house of Thomas and Sarah Grant and their son, Ben. The police make a house-to-house search, but Grant, fearing his family's safety, reveals nothing. Al, driving to the rescue of the fugitives, is shot and killed. Mike and Terry force Jane and Ben into a car and head for the highway. With the police in pursuit, they are forced to abandon the car near an observatory.
