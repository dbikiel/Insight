The great sorcerer Merlin has returned to Camelot, a kingdom now vulnerable to ill fates and war since the theft of the Holy Grail, its greatest gift and protection. With the help of Jack, an irascible young beggar-thief imbued with his own unruly magic, the fight against unknown dangers begins-to find the Grail, restore it to its rightful place, and bring Camelot back to its glory days.
After sleeping for fifty years, the enchanter Merlin awakes weak and returns to the decadent Camelot, where he finds that the Holy Grail has vanished. With the kingdom under siege by the savage Rauskaug that is helped by the evil sorceress Lady of the Lake, Merlin seeks help with the thief and aspirant sorcerer Jack to find the protection of the Holy Grail. However, he realizes that corruption has doomed Camelot.
