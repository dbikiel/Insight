A group of women who are imprisoned on the island of Sumatra by the Japanese during World War II use music as relieve their misery.
The group of women from different countries and social levels are prisoners in a Japanese POW camp, where one of them, Adrienne, who is a graduate of the Royal Academy of Music, organizes a vocal band in spite of their guards resistance.
When the Japanese over-run Singapore in 1942 many women and children end up in prison camp. Although of different ages, nationalities and backgrounds, a bond grows up as they face the lack of food and medicine and the brutal behaviour of their captors. They even start organizing a voice orchestra using remembered musical scores painstakingly written out again.
