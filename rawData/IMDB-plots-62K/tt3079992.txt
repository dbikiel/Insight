Lunatique is a sci-fi shortfilm about a lonely woman who fights daily for survival in a post apocalyptic world.
In a post-apocalyptic world that is scorched from end to end, a solitary woman is honing her surviving skills, hoping to have a fighting chance in this endless purgatory. There is not a soul in sight apart from her silent pet companion--any attempts to communicate with the outside world are simply in vain; however, she must venture into this dangerous place sometime. Armed with a lethal semi-automatic sniper carbine, the resilient survivor walks in peril, knowing that this may be her last day on this earth. Is she the hunter or the quarry?
