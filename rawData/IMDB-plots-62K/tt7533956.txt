Antoine, a bachelor party-goer, gets new roommates: Jeanne and her two children.
Antoine is a tough bachelor, party animal and seducer. He lives in a beautiful Parisian apartment with Thomas, his roommate, where the evenings are intense. When Thomas leaves to live in Los Angeles, he finds him a new roommate to replace him - "Jeanne, 1m70, blue eyes". The description makes him salivate, but he does not know yet that the charming Jeanne does not move alone, but accompanied by her two children: Theo, 8 years old, and Lou, 5 years old. Antoine, who is far from being a chicken daddy, will taste despite himself the joys of family life. His life suddenly becomes a nightmare.
