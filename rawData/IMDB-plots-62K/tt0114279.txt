The classic Shakespearean play about a murderously scheming King staged in an alternative fascist England setting.
William Shakespeare's classic play is brought into the present with the setting as Great Britian in the 1930s. Civil war has erupted with the House of Lancaster on one side, claiming the right to the British throne and hoping to bring freedom to the country. Opposing is the House of York, commanded by the infamous Richard III (Sir Ian McKellen), who rules over a fascist government and hopes to install himself as a dictator monarch.
Based upon the famous National Theatre production Shakespeare's story of Richard III (Sir Ian McKellen) is set in a mythical fascist London of the 1930s. Richard seeks to gain the throne from his elder brother, Edward (Christopher Bowen), by any means within his grasp including murder, marriage, and fratricide. But aside from Edward, his other brother, Clarence (Sir Nigel Hawthorne), and Edward's two young sons also stand between Richard and the crown of England.
This movie adaptation of Shakespeare's famous play is set into a hypothetical 1930s Europe. As sneering, leering Richard of Gloucester's (Sir Ian McKellen's) ruthless machinations bring him ever nearer the throne of England, royal blood is mercilessly spilt. Finally, only one foe remains to challenge his grasping claim, valiant Richmond. Will he prevail? Heavy Nazi-like pageantry and iconography color this modern adaptation of a classic Shakespearean History.
