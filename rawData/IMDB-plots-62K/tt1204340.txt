The story of Joseph, a man plagued by violence and a rage that is driving him to self-destruction. As Joseph's life spirals into turmoil, a chance at redemption appears in the form of Hannah, a Christian charity shop worker. Their relationship develops to reveal that Hannah is hiding a secret of her own with devastating consequences to both of their lives.
Joseph is a loner, a bitter, foul-mouthed man who mistrusts relationships. After being beaten up by a gang he flees to a charity shop and meets its sole volunteer Hannah with whom he strikes up a friendship of sorts, asking her to pray for a dying friend and inviting her to the man's wake. However Hannah is a victim of domestic violence and, after receiving a particularly severe beating from her husband, moves in with Joseph. Joseph goes to her house to collect her things, where a shock lies in store for him. Despite the lack of a conventional happy end it is clear that Joseph and Hannah may have a future.
