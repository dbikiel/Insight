Throughout the world, esteemed scientists are assassinated right before a major scientific convention in Dallas. Without a doubt, this killing spree has to do with the upcoming International World Arms Removal project, a sophisticated, state-of-the-art satellite system which has the ability to detect any weapons however big or small, under the most difficult weather conditions. For fear of being targeted, scientist Antonio Morales asks for the Agency's protection while on his way to Dallas, a job for Special Agent Samantha Maxx. As Dr Morales plays a key role in the full operational capacity of the IWAR system, he must be protected at all costs, however, can Agent Maxx stop Black Widow's assassins?
