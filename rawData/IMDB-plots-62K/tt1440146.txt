Ilva runs her stepfather's Eden Palace cinema in wartime Paris against a background of Resistance activities, the frequent sight of less fortunate Parisians being shipped east in cattle-trains and, later, the impact of the D-Day landings. Over time a number of other lives intersect with hers, including a German officer and then two American servicemen. A post-war shooting comes to dominate her story along, perhaps surprisingly, with cinema itself.
