When socialites Julia and Sydney (early 30's) leave their cushy - if stagnant - lives in Chicago to embark on a road-trip, they end up on the wrong side of the law in a tiny town in Wyoming. Forced to serve 30 days community service, Sydney discovers there's more to life than can be purchased with a gold card and Julia learns that her "perfect" life back home might be a sham and what she thought she wanted isn't what she wants at all.
