A DEA undercover agent who works for the biggest cocaine exporter of the region refuses to perform a hit for the drug lord. The assignment becomes personal and decides to strike back before it's too late.
Amid explosive turmoil, corruption, and rampant violence, the dauntless journalist, Marcelo Villalba, forms a political party, intent on stopping once and for all the reign of terror of the powerful Argentinian drug lord, Gonzalo Reyes. Before long, things will take a dangerous turn, when Reyes sends the undercover DEA agent, Cliff Adams, to assassinate the presidential candidate. Now, Cliff's old flame, Janet--who tries to get enough evidence against Gonzalo--finds herself caught in the middle of a brutal conflict, as the ruthless criminal kingpin and his unstoppable personal army will stop at nothing to protect their lucrative business. Can Cliff, the heroic American Scorpion, take down an entire cocaine empire?
Miami DEA agent Cliff Adams is in South America working undercover for Gonzalo Reyes, the biggest cocaine exporter in South America. Cliff's fianc√©e, Janet Meade, is a reporter doing a story about Reyes. Reyes orders Cliff to kill Marcelo Villalba, who is running for his countries position as president, but Cliff can't bring himself to do it, because his assignment from the DEA is to work against Reyes. Reyes is afraid Villalba will put him out of business, and is afraid that Janet's story will do the same thing, so Reyes sends someone else after Villalba, and then Reyes has Janet kidnapped, and Cliff is the only one who can keep Reyes' plans from succeeding.
