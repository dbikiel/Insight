A mother stops at nothing to recover her kidnapped son.
In the US, a child goes missing every 40 seconds. You never think it will happen to you. Until it does. Alone and scared, Karla Dyson (Halle Berry) is unwilling to leave the fate of her son's life in someone else's hands. When she catches a glimpse of the abductors speeding away, she decides to fight back. In a heart pounding race against time, Karla begins a high speed pursuit and will stop at nothing to save her son's life.
Working-class, single mother, Karla Dyson, feels the ground fall out from beneath her feet when a carefree afternoon in the park with her only son, the 6-year-old Frankie, turns into a living nightmare as he is abducted in broad daylight. Fortunately, as the desperate mother catches a glimpse of Frankie being shoved into a beat-up car, the resolute Karla will take matters into her own hands, unleashing a blind and furious chase on the Interstate highways. Promising herself that she will never stop, the pained mother will push herself beyond her limits, nevertheless, is Karla's maternal instinct enough to get Frankie back?
Karla Dyson, a diner waitress, lives a mostly perfect life as a single mother with her six-year-old son Frankie despite fighting a custody battle/court order with her estranged husband. One day, Karla takes Frankie to the local carnival. Upon entering, she temporarily leaves her son, in order to take an important phone call from the divorce lawyer she is working with. But when Karla returns, she finds that her son is missing, leaving his toy voice recorder behind. Frantically searching for her son, Karla sees a woman dragging Frankie aggressively into a green Ford Mustang and, while the car is driving away, she clings at the side of the car trying to stop them, losing her phone in the process. Karla drives her car and chases the other one, with an ensuing lengthy chase.
