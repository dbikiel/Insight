A young boy learns he is part of a powerful race of psionic humans who must fight the normal humans determined to keep them from Earth.
Jomy Mark Shin is a seemingly ordinary boy on Earth, but fate has shown him something different. The authorities learn that he is a Mu, a member of race of psionic humans that are marked for death by the Central computer called Mother Eliza. He is rescued by a rebel group of Mu's lead by Soldier Blue, who shows him that he is of artificial birth in a space colony. Now, Jomy must be the successor to Soldier Blue and fight for the survival of his people and the right to return to Earth. However, the human forces lead by the elite officer, Keith Anyan, are a formidable and deadly threat.
Jomy Marcus Shin and Keith Anyan were childhood friends together, not caring about their world, and accepting whatever life gave them. However, events soon change them: Jomy discovers that he is one of the Mu, a human with psychic abilities that are considered outcasts. This marks him out for death, but he is rescued and taken into an underground society of Mu. He eventually accustoms to being a Mu, and rises to become one of their greatest leaders. Meanwhile, Keith, possessing superior intelligence and ability, also becomes a leader - of the human race. A clash between the former friends is now inevitable, as the Mu decide to achieve their prime goal: to unite with the humans and travel toward the Terra, the home planet they originated from.
