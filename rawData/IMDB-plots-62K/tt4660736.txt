Inevitably, a transfer to a maximum security prison will eventually challenge the integrity and ethics of a young correctional officer on his way to become a chief executioner.
Aiman is a 28-year-old Malay correctional officer who is recently transferred to the territory's top prison. He lives with his older sister Suhaila in a modest housing estate. At his new workplace, Aiman begins to take an interest in a 65-year-old sergeant named Rahim. Soon, it is revealed that the charismatic Rahim is actually the long-serving chief executioner of the prison. Rahim also takes notice of the principled and diligent Aiman. When Rahim's assistant suddenly quits, he asks Aiman to become his apprentice. Aiman tells Suhaila of his new job position, but Suhaila becomes upset, as their father was actually executed by Rahim. Aiman knew this all along. Can Aiman overcome his conscience and a haunted past to possibly take over as the next chief executioner?
Once a troubled teenager himself, young Aiman, a former army regular and a correctional officer for the past two years, driven by his desire to help those who want to change, is transferred from Commonwealth to Larangan's maximum security prison workshop to handle the rehabilitated prisoners. Even though his personal reasons for wanting this transfer are quite ambiguous, before long, Aiman will meet with the prison's chief executioner Rahim, who as a seasoned hangman for more than thirty years, will see a man of discipline and principles in Aiman and take him under his wing. Eventually, when Rahim's assistant unexpectedly decides to resign, the chief will ask Aiman to take over, learn the "ropes" and the tricks of the trade, and ultimately, take pride in the humane methodology used in this horrifyingly repellent profession. As the eager apprentice's macabre fascination draws him closer to the chief executioner, will there be any place left for compassion?
