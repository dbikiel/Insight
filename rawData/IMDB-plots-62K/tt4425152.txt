Nectar from a magic flower allows three girls to live as boys for a while.
Three young girls' friendship is tested after they plant a very special flower; the Nectar from the flower changes their lives - and friendship - forever, as they get a taste of what it's like growing up as a boy. It's a story of how we've created gender, and how to know who you are when society is telling you who you should be, but also a story about young love and lust.
