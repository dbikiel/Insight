Bill Lawrence wins a slew of prizes on a radio quiz program. His happiness is short-lived when he discovers he'll have to sell the prizes in order to pay the taxes on them.
When Bill Lawrence wins a radio-program's $24,000-valued jackpot, the lives of he and his family are turned upside down. They are showered with everything from a pony to a washing machine; a female French portrait painter and a very effeminate interior decorator. The situation turns into a domestic crisis when an internal-revenue agent informs him that he will have to pay income tax on all of the prizes.
