On becoming aware that Sid is their camp counselor, the children quickly realize that Sid may not be qualified for the job.
Sid, the well-meaning and kind primaeval sloth, along with a small group of inquisitive children, go out on a fascinating camping trip, to witness firsthand the infinite wonders of prehistoric nature. With Scrat, the indefatigable acorn-seeker, always trying to find the perfect nut, the team will soon discover that their adult guide is somewhat lacking the basic skills one needs to master to survive the wilderness--and to make matters worse--there is someone out there stalking them. Who is this mysterious follower? What will happen if Sid's clumsiness triggers a geological chain reaction of epic proportions?
