Vida explains her real name is Adeline March and she had a twin sister Emmeline. After the Second World War they are brought up in a large country mansion by their spaced out mother Isabelle and equally unstable uncle Charles, running wild, and Isabelle brings in governess Hester Barrow to - unsuccessfully - tame them, leading to the girls being parted. As Hester elopes with the local doctor and Isabelle and Charles die, the girls continue to live in the - officially haunted - house. In the present, Margaret, who has visited the burnt out house and is starting to believe in ghosts, learns why Vida's most famous book, The Thirteenth Tale only consisted of twelve stories.
