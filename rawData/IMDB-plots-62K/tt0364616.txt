When a group of poachers are found dead in the deep forests of the Pacific Northwest, a mob of revenge hungry hunters pursue the beast while four high school seniors try to save it.
In the deep woods of Echo Mountain, Pine Creek, three poachers are slaughtered by a predator and the survivor, Ed, organizes an illegal hunting with three other hunters. Meanwhile, the teenagers Rich and Jay are assigned by their biology teacher to prepare a seminar together about species in danger of extinction. Jay invites his girlfriend Shea and his cousin Jenny to camp with Rich and him in the forest to research animals for their work. Meanwhile the Indian Ranger John Eagleheart is also in the woods tracking the Sasquatch. When Ed and his men are attacked by the Big Foot, the teenagers try to escape to save their lives.
This is the story of Pine Creek, a town where generations have felt themselves robbed of hope - and glancing nervously over one shoulder - since the infamous Echo Mountain Massacre, a black mark on the town's history, wherein a group of local hunters were mercilessly butchered by a massive, hairy beast comparable to the ancient Indian tales of the Yeti. Many come to doubt the story, and even attempt to dismiss it in their minds as a grizzly bear attack - until the creature resurfaces in the flesh and, refusing to be brushed aside, begins a new rampage that carries the town into a waking nightmare. Now, a pack of thrill-hungry, heat-packing high school students and vengeance-obsessed hunters set out in search of the creature, to bring it home on a slab once and for all.
