The Office of Strategic Services parachutes two Austrian naturalized citizens Fred Mayer and Hans Wijnberg back into the Austrian Alps to strike back at Nazi Germany during "Operation Greenup".
Quentin Tarantino's movie "Inglourious Basterds" centred around a team of Jewish (largely Jewish-American) soldiers who operated behind enemy lines, killing any Nazis they could find. This is a documentary on the real Inglorious Bastards - Jewish agents for the American OSS (Office of Strategic Services), sent in as spies into Nazi-held territories. Some of these spies were German Jews, returning to avenge the wrongs committed against their people and free Germany from the Nazis. Some of their deeds surpass even the fictional feats in Tarantino's movie.
