A hot, young starlet with a flair for bad behavior finds herself stuck in a small New England town with a rigid, yet endearingly traditional police officer. Sparks fly.
Bill Morgan (Jace McLean) is a small town sheriff whose self-imposed rules have kept him in Washington, New Hampshire for his entire life. A stickler for perfection and abiding by the rules, Bills singular ambition is to keep order for himself and those around him.Everything changes when It-Girl movie starlet, Nikki Gold (Mircea Monroe), who has escaped the bright lights and paparazzi of New York City, if only for a brief while, is found passed out in her rental car by none other than Bill Morgan -- who has absolutely no idea who she is. In an effort to avoid the chaos of yet another publicity scandal, Nikki embraces the anonymity for a few blissful days of normalcy.Shot on location in New Hampshire against a picturesque, fall-colored backdrop, 3 Days of Normal follows Bill and Nikki during 3 magical days as they find themselves relying on one another to face their own personal challenges.The film features a great supporting cast including Ajay Naidu (Gods Behaving Badly) as the intrusive entertainment journalist, Alex Anfanger (The Secret Life of Walter Mitty) as the meddling kid out to make a quick buck, Lin Shaye (Theres Something About Mary) as Bills Aunt and Richard Riehl (Bridesmaids) as Bills Uncle and the towns Chief of Police.
