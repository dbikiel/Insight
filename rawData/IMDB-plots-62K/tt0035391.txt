On December 6, 1941, Captain Yamanada of the Japanese aircraft carrier "Hiranamu", orders full steam ahead for Pearl Harbor. His ship encounters and sinks an American yacht and the single survivor, Sue Curry, is rescued by an American submarine, the "Sea Serpent", commanded by Commander Chris Warren. He hears her story and attempts to radio a warning to Pearl Harbor. Yamanada, hearing the signals, orders the airlines jammed, and then sends his son into the air to sink the sub. The attack fails, after the sub makes a crash dive, but they fail in their warning attempts. The next morning, December 7th, the men on the sub hear the story of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and devise a desperate plan to sink the Japanese carrier by letting the carrier know their position. The carrier comes in search of the submarine.
En route to attack Pearl Harbor, the Japanese aircraft carrier Hiranamu attacks and sinks an American registered pleasure yacht, the Vayu. The Captain e en sends out his own son, a Navy pilot, to ensure all aboard are killed. There is only one survivor, Sue Curry, who is rescued by an American submarine on patrol in the area. Hostilities haven't been declared as yet but the sub's attempt to radio information of the yacht attack to Pearl Harbor is jammed by the Japanese ship. After the attack, the sub's commander sets a trap, intent on sinking the aircraft carrier.
