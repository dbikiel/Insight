An action movie about a 7-foot-tall docile man who learns Muy Thai and then uses his new skills to help solve a case of stolen diamonds.
Gentle giant Barney Emerald is drugged and robbed while on holiday in Pattaya. He befriends two Thai sisters, one who can speak English, another who is a muay-thai kick-boxing champion, and stays with them until he can recover his passport. After eating some spicy "somtum" at their mother's restaurant, he accidentally demolishes the place. He vows to find a way to earn the money to rebuild the restaurant.
While visiting Thailand, a large Australian named Barney (Nathan Jones) gets his passport and money stolen. Stuck in Thailand, unable to speak the language or defend himself from local thugs, he is taken in by two young girls, Dokya (Sasisa Jindamanee) and Katen (Nawarat Techarathanaprasert). They cook a spicy Somtum salad for him, which turns him into a big red monster. Barney promises to pay them back for all the damage he caused during his firey rage, and eventually the girls realize that his unusual reaction may help solve their problems.
