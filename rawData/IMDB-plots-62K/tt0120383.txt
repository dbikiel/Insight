A group of crooks, an ex con, his friend and a gun crazy gangster plan a drug heist, but not everything goes as planned.
A drug deal goes wrong causing a foursome, led by a lunatic killer, to go on the run. A couple in a recreational vehicle are initially kidnapped, but soon the male hostage is emulating his kidnappers and wants to stay involved in the chase.
Raymond Lembecke, who was just freed from prison, meets his girlfriend Addy again and plans a robbery of a drug dealer together with Marcus and Curtis. Everything goes awfully wrong and they run out of the city, kidnapping middle-class couple Gordon and Donna in the process. They come to a small New Mexico town, where they try to give the stolen drugs to powerful mob boss Tony Vago and live in the house of former Raymond's cellmate Wayne.
Former inmate Raymond Lembecke has just been released from prison, and, having after met up with his girlfriend, Abby, plans a drug sale to the mafia boss, Tony Vaago, in which they have no idea the drugs belonged to him. After the steal goes wrong, they find themselves fleeing authorities en route to Vaago to make the sale. When they are informed of their situation, the sale goes horribly wrong and they are once again forced to flee, eventually winding up in the middle of a remote New Mexico town, Raymond's brothers house.
