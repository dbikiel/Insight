About men, about women, about essential reality of their relationships in bright and good looking Moscow. The whole film is the lecture about love like it is a child of chemistry and psychology. During this lecture we are watching through five or even more love stories about couples trying to pretend that relationship they have is special and outstanding. But the most valuable words said already at the beginning by the woman from the first couple: 'Let's go home. Will be living'. And these words mean the end of love. And the beginning the same time.
