In order to avoid the death of the husband (the criminal boss Don Vincenzo, "King of the Fish"), Donna Maria sends her henchmen to kill a lookalike (a shoe-seller) and then she sets up a fake funeral, while the husband is hiding in a secret place. But a nurse saw Don Vincenzo alive in the hospital while he was supposed to be dead, as the TV says. To hush the witness up, Don Vincenzo orders to his best trained bodyguards, Ciro and Rosario, to find the nurse and kill her. Ciro finds the nurse: surprisingly she is Fatima, the only girl he ever loved, which he had abandoned when he began his criminal career. To save her, Ciro hides Fatima by his uncle Mimmo, and starts a bloody fight with all his clan, including his best friend Rosario.
