Emmy winner, Linda Yellen, brings together an all-star ensemble cast for Chantilly Lace which received worldwide acclaim for its intimate exploration of the secret lives of women. Seven women friends - including a nun in crisis, an angry divorcee, and an unfiltered, sexually-charged artist - gather in the Colorado Rockies at the upscale vacation home of Val (Eikenberry), to celebrate the surprise 40th birthday of a popular film critic, Natalie (Williams). When Val's offbeat younger sister (Sheedy) arrives with a newcomer, a maverick photojournalist played by Emmy winner, Martha Plimpton, tensions rise as secrets of love, loss and betrayal are revealed. Years of friendship are tested in a pivotal year as the women assemble again for the engagement of another and once more to bereave the shocking death of a third. What began as an experiment at Sundance Film Institute, Chantilly Lace, explores the landscape of contemporary women's issues with humor and honesty 'unlike any American film.'
