In Las Vegas for a quicky divorce, a just-paroled ex-cop and his wife wander into the Top of the World Casino, run by the shady Charles Atlas. They win big, right as the casino is being robbed. The police believe their big win was a staged diversion, and the two of them become suspects. Over the course of the evening and next morning, the two attempt to escape to surrounded casino, and to prove their innocence, as well as to save their marriage.
An ex-cop (Weller) who has just been released from prison where he was sent for absconding with $4000 from the police pension fund gets taken by his wife (Carrere) to Vegas for a divorce. Waiting for her outside a casino where his parole forbids him to enter, he hands a casino hostess money to stick in the slots where he hits a $450,000 jackpot. Meanwhile a gang plots the robbery of the casino which puts the ex-cop in the center. In trying to clear his name, he discovers that the casino owner (Hopper) and his assistant (Pantoliano) actually have plotted the theft.
