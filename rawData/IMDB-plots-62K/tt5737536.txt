A young boy searches a future world wasteland for a rumored cure for his dying mother.
Inside a desert oasis, a queen (Lucy Liu) lays dying as her son Prince (Jeffrey Wahlberg) travels across barren waste lands to find a near-mythical medicine to save her life. After evading violent raiders on motorbikes led by the Warlord (James Franco) and his enforcer (Cliff "Method Man" Smith), Prince meets Ash (Suki Waterhouse), the Warlord's robot sex companion-assassin who's in search of her own soul. As Prince is captured by the Druglord (Milla Jovovich), the Warlord's forces roar in - and Prince fights to save the remnants of humanity.
