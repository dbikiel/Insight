The caped crusaders versus The Wizard, black-hooded mastermind.
Antisocial Prof. Hammil's Remote Control device, which enables the user to take over any motor vehicle within 50 miles (!), is stolen by The Wizard, black-hooded mastermind, and his gang. Batman and Robin (who drive about in a standard convertible) must prevent the Wizard from obtaining diamonds, needed as fuel for the device, and rescue magazine photographer Vicki Vale from periodic perils. Where is the Wizard's base, reached only by remote controlled submarine? Which of several suspicious characters hides beneath the Wizard's hood?
Batman (Robert Lowery) and Robin-The Boy Wonder (Johnny Duncan), whose real identities are Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson, are asked to help by Police Commissioner Jim Gordon (Lyle Talbot)of Gotham City in his search for a Remote-Control machine stolen by a mysterious, cloaked-and-hooded figure known only as The Wizard. The machine was invented by eccentric Professor Hammil ('William Fawcett'), aided by his valet, Carter (Leonard Penn).
