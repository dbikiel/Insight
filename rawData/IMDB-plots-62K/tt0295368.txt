Four unlikely assassins genuinely care about their customers and victims, meanwhile a prosecutor is on their trail.
Guns and Talks: (a Dark Comedy)In the heart of Seoul, Korea, a band of 4 killers-for-hire is slowly making a name for themselves in the business. Two brothers, Sang-yun (Shin Hyoon-Joon) and Ha-yun (Bin Won), and their two friends, Jae Young (Jeong Jae-yeong) and Jung-woo (Shin Ha-gyoon), have attracted the attention of a couple of pesky detectives, Sergeant Kim (Jung Gyu-soo) and Inspector Cho (Jeong Jin-yeong).The assassins style kill the victims the way their clients want them to be killed, no questions asked. For this group to succeed, they need the help of each other and an uncle who designs super cool gadgets in the privacy of his own home. However, the foursome will need more than manpower and an uncle to carry out a new mission they just accepted. Along with an intelligent detective hot on their trail, the killers must accomplish "the perfect crime" or face the consequences. Will their mischievous ways be too much of a burden or will they pull out the crime of the century?
