Peralejos de Arriba, a quiet Spanish village, is a place where nothing ever happens. One day an emigrant called Angelino returns to the village to spend the holidays, driving a magnificent Mercedes and explaining beautiful things about Germany and its women. Pepe, fascinated by the stories of his friend, decides to emigrate also to Munich, but his dream begins at five in the morning, cleaning windows, and ends at midnight by sticking posters or washing dishes.
