A championship wrestling match pits Koji Taguchi against Crush Volcano, the latter no match to Koji's signature move, the Torture Ring Strangler. Koji beams as he clutches the champion belt, only to have it snatched away by a mysterious new challenger in the ring - a giant squid, in fact, who not only evades Koji's key attack, but destroys him with a Northern Light Suplex! Koji's fiancÃfÂ©e Niako watches tearfully, though there's something about this calamari wrestler that seems familiar... The Tentacle Tackler is the hottest story in the Japanese sports news, the President ofthe Cho-Nippon wrestling team proposes a fixed match as a publicity stunt, but the honourable Calamari Wrestler will hear nothing of it. Wrongfully banned from the sport, he retreats to the Monhonji Temple to train and meditate, where a young reporter tracks him down and begins to unravel his enigma. But the Squid's problems are just beginning - treacherous businessmen, unrequited love, and the wrestling ring menace of the Octopus Wrestler and the Insectoid Squilla boxer await.
