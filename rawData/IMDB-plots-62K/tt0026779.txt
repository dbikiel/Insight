Duke Regan is the high-pressure, irresponsible promotions/marketing/press agent at the Ritz Hotel. He gets the taste of the home cooking, done by the mother of Marcia Jaynos, but thinks it was done by her brother, Leopold. Leopold has delusions of being a great chef, and the ability to delude Duke into the same, even to the point of selling him to the Ritz as a famous foreign chef. Sounds like a job for Mama.
