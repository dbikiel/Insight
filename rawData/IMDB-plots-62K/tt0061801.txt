The professional and romantic misadventures of an advertising executive in 1960s swinging London.
Advertising golden boy Andrew Quint (Oliver Reed) is fed up with his fabulously successful life. In very dramatic fashion, he quits his job to return to writing for a small literary magazine. He wants to leave his former life behind, going as far as saying goodbye to his wife and mistresses. He finds, however, that it's not so easy to escape the past.
