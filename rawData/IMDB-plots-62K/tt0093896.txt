Lupin and his gang are called to action when Goemon's fianc√© is held hostage by a mysterious ninja clan.
Lupin (referred to as "Rupan" in AnimEigo's translations) must rescue his companion Goemon's bride-to-be after she is kidnapped by a ninja clan intent on stealing her family's ancestral treasure.
It's Goemon's Big Day as he's about to marry Murasaki, a sweet and innocent girl. Lupin Jigen, and Fujiko came to the ceremony to witness this moment, but the wedding was interrupted by a group of Fuma Ninjas, who are after Murasaki's family's prized vase. They failed to steal the vase so they kidnap Murasaki. As she'll be a ransom for the vase. The reason why they want that vase is because it's the key to uncovering an ancient treasure hidden in the mountains. Lupin is interested in this so called treasure, but Goemon finds Murasaki's life more important than the treasure. So the quest begins as they race to prevent the Fuma from obtaining the treasure.
