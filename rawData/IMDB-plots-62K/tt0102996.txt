Two black friends, one of lighter skin complexion than the other, try to use each other to improve their social and professional positions.
Fun-loving Bobby is a mail boy in a big firm, but he has a trump card, his best friend Waymon, a "white" African-American who is almost a partner in the firm. They make a deal: Waymon will try to move Bobby to the trainee broker programme if he will help him meet Natalie, the girl of his dreams. There's only one problem, everyone will have to change...
Sharp social satire in which the uneven friendship between an ambitious black businessman and his streetwise pal is thrown into still more confusion when the professional falls in love with a mind-numbingly gorgeous waitress.
