A seasoned senior enlisted special operations (spec ops) United States Marine is wounded during combat operations in Iraq. He is retired from the Marine Corps and visits a friend on a ranch in the south west. When he arrives he discovers his friend has disappeared and no one will even admit to knowing of him.
During operation Desert Storm in Iraq, the tough Marine Sergeant of Special Operations MacPherson and his great pal and family man, the Mexican Corporal Miguel Silva, are seriously wounded and retired. Later, the veteran and traumatized marine is insistently invited by Miguel to visit him in his lands in New Lago, a location nearby the border with Mexico. When MacPherson arrives in the town, he does not find his friend and he gets no information from the locals about Miguel. Soon he realizes that the CEO of Halicorp and vigilante, Rhodes, is buying cheap lands, giving infrastructure, constructing buildings, housing and facilities using slave labor from the needy Mexicans and making lots of money. When MacPherson finds that his family and friend have been executed by Rhodes, he promises to bring hell to God's land.
This is a re-make of the much under-appreciated, but classic Spencer Tracy movie Bad Day at Black Rock (1955).
