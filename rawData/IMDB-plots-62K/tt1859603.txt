Before leaving for college, a recently dumped goth girl's life changes forever when she falls in love with a smart and professional college grad who is staying in the family's guest house.
18 year-old Rachel is mature for her age. She s a hip aspiring songwriter and a blue-eyed blond bad girl who often clashes with her single father. Only because she is grounded she is at home for the arrival of dad's new employee, Amy, who is staying in their swanky Los Angeles guest house for the weekend. A wholesome college graduate fresh to California from the cornfields of Iowa, Amy happily confesses her dreams and desires to Rachel over the course of the next few days and the two women gradually fall in love. It seems like anything is possible here. Amy proclaims as they ramble across the city in Rachel's dad's Hummer. Out and about in Los Angeles the two girls can't keep their hands off each other. At home in the guest house their activities are even hotter.
