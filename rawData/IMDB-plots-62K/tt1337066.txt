A group of criminals would like to sell some weapons for an undercover policeman. Johan Falk's team is watching the operation meanwhile Frank Wagner is also in the game. Rydell, the gang leader changes his mind and doesn't sell the weapons 'cause he found someone else for a bigger shipment. Later on Frank got a list what weapons required by the new buyer and there are not just AK's demanded. Some more serious equipments - e.g. automated grenade launcher - are needed, too. Frank wants to quit from the gang so he is forwarding the list to Johan. The mysterious buyer is a mercenary from Serbia.
