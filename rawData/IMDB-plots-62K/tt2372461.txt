'1210' is a shrilly story of a 'small person' seeking justice from the state. All his attempts are bound to fail. He's a superfluous nasty old spot, rejected even by his own family. Going mad is probably the only way out for a totally forgotten war veteran, burgled and miserable. It still remains a question, however, whether the 'crazy' man is really so in our 'normal' world, or it's the world itself which turned crazy from its own indifference. Knocked down by despair, the man resorts to committing a horrible deed. A deed unlikely to be pardoned...
Nikolai Baranov is a retired officer and a veteran of the now forgotten Soviet war in Afghanistan. His son, a soldier in Nikolai's unit, was killed in the Afghan war. And Nikolai still blames himself for his death. On an anniversary of his son's death, Nikolai learns that an anticipated increase in his veteran's pension, one thousand two hundred and ten rubles (equivalent of 37 dollars), is canceled. Feelings of offended dignity, guilt and growing despair push Nikolai to a terrible act.
