Amangol's father cuts her hair and sends her to a village to work as a boy in a carpet weaving shop.
Born into absolute poverty, a young girl Amangol is forced to shave her head, disguise herself as a boy and go to work as the apprentice of a rug weaver to help pay for her desperately ill mother's medication. As her master's cruel brutality and greed becomes progressively clear, her only comfort comes from the companionship of her co-workers, in particular another girl Belghies. Despite the violent and suspicious behaviour of their employer, a deep friendship blossoms between the two girls in this haunting and visceral tale of tyranny and silver linings.
Amangol (Altinay Ghelich Taghani) is the eldest daughter in a poor rural family. To help support them, her head is shaven and begins work as a boy named Aman in an isolated carpet weaving shop. The girls who work there are beaten by the owner, as is Aman, toiling at the loom until their hands bleed. As a male apprentice, he supervises the girls and lives in the shop, locked in and isolated.
