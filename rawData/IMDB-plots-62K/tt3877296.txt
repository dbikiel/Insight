Children who were held hostage in their elementary school tell stories of miraculous things, but many adults are skeptical that the Cokeville Miracle ever truly happened.
On May 16, 1986, in the small, ranching community of Cokeville, Wy, David and Doris Young took an elementary school hostage for several hours before detonating a bomb inside a single classroom that held every teacher and student in the school. In the wake of the madness, Ron Hartley, whose children were inside the classroom, must fight his skepticism and unbelief as he hears eye witness accounts from the students of miraculous, heavenly intervention during the crisis. When tragedy strikes... what do you see?
In 1986, a lunatic and his wife took over the Elementary school in the little town of Cokeville, Wyoming. They lured the entire student body and teachers into one room, holding them hostage with guns and a bomb. Two hours later, the bomb exploded but only two deaths associated with the incident occurred - the mad man and his wife. Though some were burned, all the children and adults got out alive. But the real story began in the days and weeks following the siege, when several of the children began telling their parents that the reason they escaped safely was because of people in the room, dressed in white, who told them what to do and protected them.
