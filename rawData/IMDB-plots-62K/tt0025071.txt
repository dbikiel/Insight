Popeye and Bluto each wants to save Olive as she sleepwalks onto a construction site. But most of their efforts go into preventing each other from being the hero.
Olive goes sleepwalking on the roof of her apartment building. She knocks off a planter, which wakes up Bluto and Popeye, in adjacent rooms one floor down. They fight over who will save her, ultimately ending up high atop a construction site.
Popeye and Bluto see that Olive Oyl is sleepwalking and obliviously putting herself in great danger. She walks along a flagpole, on top of a tall building and finally wanders onto a construction site, where she's in greater danger than ever. "I've gotta save her," cries Popeye, making a melodramatic gesture. However, Bluto is not about to let the little "pop-eyed freak," as he calls him, become Olive's hero. Olive becomes the unconscious object of her two suitors' rivalry. And because neither will let the other rescue her, she may not survive the night. Her one hope is that one of her boyfriends will overpower the other in time. That hope finally comes in the form of a can of spinach.
