Father Frost is preparing gifts for forest animals for the New Year, and Gray Wolf and Crow come up with a plan to steal hares. For this, the Crow distracted Father Frost, and the Wolf stole his festive outfit and a bag of gifts. Having dressed up, the Wolf and the Crow go to hares. Meanwhile, the Father Hare and the Mother Hare went away to get the Christmas tree and ordered the hares to not open the door to anyone. But the Wolf came in the dress of Father Frost, and of course, Ushastik, Fluffy, Bell and Jumper were happy to open to him. They climbed into the bag for gifts themselves.
