As Eastern Anatolian village tradition requires, 27 year old Medine must serve oven-roasted lamb at her five year old son Mert's circumcision feast. Poor but determined, Medine puts the family to work cutting branches to earn something towards the price of the sheep they need.
The wife of the village's poorest family, the 27-year-old Medine, wishes to make her mark in the community by putting on a feast for the circumcision of her 5-year-old son, Ismail. Although she asks for assistance from her circle, nobody seems to be interested in helping her. In the meantime, Banu, a prostitute who recently came to town, distracts her unemployed husband Ibrahim and asks him for money. Thanks to her stubbornness, Medine organizes the feast. During the event, Medine declares that she has served Ismail as the lamb. The guests are terrified to hear that they have eaten Ismail and they became cannibals. They decide to keep this unfortunate event to themselves. One day, Medine return to the village with her children Ismail and Vicdan. Daily life looks normal. However nothing is ever the same as before in the village.
