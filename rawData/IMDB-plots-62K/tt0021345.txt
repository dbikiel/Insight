The West Indies island of Portuga exists mainly for sponge diving. But the best area of collection is frequented by a very large manta ray. Nina loses her brother to the creature and is comforted by a newly arrived minister, who seems very interested in an old poster offering a reward for a convict recently escaped from nearby Devil's Island. More deaths attributed to the sea bat follow before Nina resolves her feelings for her comforter.
Diving for sponges is risky at best and even more so when the best sponge-water is the home of a very large and hostile-to-divers manta ray. On the near-by island, men fight like beasts for the heart of Nina, the flower of the Pacific. The ruler of the island is a drunk who has lost control of the people, so this isn't exactly paradise. Juan is in love with Nina, but Juan is meaner and disposes of Carl her brother by cutting his life line while Carl is out sponge-diving and dodging the manta ray. Then, Sims, an escaped convict, who must have swum all the way around South America if he came from Devil's Island, shows up posing as a minister. Nina takes a great liking to this man-of-the-cloth. Juan has a great dislike for him.
