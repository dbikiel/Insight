A mad farmer falls in love with his pig and has mutant piglets with it. When the "piglets" prefer their mother over him, he hangs them all and the sow kills herself.
An art-house black and white film without dialogue. It's about a man who lives alone on a farm with his pigs. He falls in love with his sow, has offscreen sex with her, and later she gives birth to human/porcine hybrids.
