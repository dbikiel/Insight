Aging wife desperately wants to sexually satisfy her husband, but he's losing interest and cheats. She seeks advice even from prostitutes but nothing helps. Tired from trying, she falls for her husband's son who reciprocates.
Antonio, a rich industrialist, married Laura, a beautiful young woman. When he can no longer satisfy her sexually, a short-term relationship is born with her stepson, Claudio, but it is enough to make her acquire the awareness of her personality and her rights. When Claudio leaves, she also leaves. Her husband searches for her, begs her to come back to him. The woman, who finally feels free, refuses. Antonio can not accept the prospect of being alone forever, and decides to kill her.
