A flapper who's secretly a good girl and a gold digging floozy masquerading as an ing√©nue both vie for the hand of a millionaire.
Diana is outwardly the hit of the party but inwardly virtuous and idealistic. Her friend Ann is thoroughly selfish and amoral. Both are attracted to Ben Blaine, soon-to-be millionaire. He takes Diana's flirtations with other boys as a sign of disinterest in him and marries Ann. Big mistake.
