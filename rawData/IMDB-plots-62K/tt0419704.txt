A story of don Quijote told by a donkey of Sancho Panza...
This is a true adventure comedy. The donkey, Rucio, tells the true story of Don Quixote and defends the idea that he wasnt mad, but in reality, Quixote was a very intelligent, passionate and enthusiastic fellow. We then follow Don Quixote, his squire, Sancho Panza (Quixotes best friend and the wealthiest man in town), Sanchos donkey, Rucio (who wants to be a horse) and a real horse, Quixotes faithful steed, Rocinante (who hates leaving his stable) on their adventure to duel the Knight of the Moon where, if Quixote wins the duel the true identity of Dulcinea will be revealed.
