Patrolling a popular tourist destination of steep cliffs that plummet into the Sea of Japan, a retired police officer vigilantly intercepts troubled souls looking to jump, his count of lives saved now over 500.
Yukio Shige, a retired police detective, has dedicated his life to preventing deaths at Japan's famed suicide cliffs, providing not just immediate assistance but counseling and shelter with his impossibly small team. Meanwhile the cliffs are becoming a tourist attraction specifically for their notoriety as a popular suicide destination.
The Tojinbo Cliffs are a popular Japanese tourist destination known for their rugged beauty. The sheer cliffs are also a favored location for those wanting to jump to their death. Retired police detective Yukio Shige has patrolled the area for more than a decade, hoping to spot troubled souls before it's too late. Though Shige has saved over 500 people, he's still haunted by the loss of an elderly couple. As tour buses arrive with local sightseers keen to absorb nature's wonder, a darkness hangs over those wishing to make it their final resting place. Award-winning director Yung Chang eloquently observes the picturesque town through one man's thoughtful vigilance. In a country with one of the highest suicide rates in the world, Shige's compassion and generosity have made him a lifeline for those with nothing left to lose.
