After meeting her in Paris, a penniless marquis relentlessly pursues a famous actress.
Rene is broke and Kay is a rich actress visiting Paris. They meet, share a cab and dinner. He is smitten by her, but she leaves for London and he follows. At her house, when he cooks the dessert, the chef quits and he takes the job, unbeknownst to Kay. By the next day, the scandal is all over London about him living in her house and that upsets Philip, who wants Kay for his wife. Kay tells Rene to leave, but Rene plans to get rid of Philip.
Donning a brunette wig to cover her famous blonde hair, American movie actress Kay Winters, incognito, is in Paris for the first time on a weekend break from filming her latest movie in London. Once a wealthy marquis, Rene Vilardell, a Frenchman, has lost all his money, he needing to pawn all his material possessions, including his good suits of clothes, to live. Only his best friend Dewey Gilson and the pawn shop owners know about his current poor financial situation. Kay and Rene have a slightly antagonistic initial meeting, but they end up falling for each other, Kay not knowing that he has no money, and Rene not knowing her true identity. It is also despite the fact that she is traveling with her boyfriend, stuffy insurance salesman Phillip Chester who wants her solely to hobnob with high society, such as with pretentious Lady Paula Malverton and her equally pretentious niece Jill, so that he can strengthen his business connections. By happenstance, Lady Malverton courts Rene's friendship as part of Paris society. Based on circumstances, Rene decides to locate Kay in London and tell her the truth about his poor financial standing, pulling a stunt in order to be near her, but which may ruin her respectable good name in the process. His goal remains to get Phillip out of the way and end up with Kay, especially as he believes she too loves him despite the problems he is causing her.
