A dramatization of Nazi Germany's final Western Front counterattack of World War II.
In the winter of 1944, the Allied Armies stand ready to invade Germany at the coming of a New Year. To prevent this occurrence, Hitler orders an all out offensive to re-take French territory and capture the major port city of Antwerp. "The Battle of the Bulge" shows this conflict from the perspective of an American intelligence officer as well as from a German Panzer Commander.
This is a novelisation of the German counter-offensive in the Ardennes, Belgium in the last months of the WW II. The German plan consists in a fast attack of a secret panzer division, unknown by the allies, at command of col. Hessler, a brilliant German officer. But as the Germans are short in fuel, a crucial movement in the plan is to capture a huge allied fuel deposit. It seems not to be difficult, but...
Fictionalized account of the battle of the Ardennes in December 1944. An intelligence officer, Lt. Col. Dan Riley, is convinced that the Germans are amassing tanks and troops for an attack but he can't get anyone to believe him. When the attack is finally launched, he correctly deduces that a shortage of petrol will lead the tanks to a massive Allied fuel depot. Along the way, we encounter a number of characters including a green Lieutenant in his first battle, the grizzled American tank commander who is worried about his black market operation and a group of German soldiers posing as American MP's.
