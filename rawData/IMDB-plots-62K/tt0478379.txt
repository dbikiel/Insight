The Lion was the king of beasts, the Jackal was his "right hand". But one day a Bull came into the Lion's territory, having lost his master. The Jackal tried to set the Lion on the Bull as an uninvited guest (apparently hoping that they would kill each other), but the Lion was smarter and much more noble than a Jackal. The Lion and the Bull became friends, which did not like the Jackal.
