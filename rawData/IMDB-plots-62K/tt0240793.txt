A warlord must fight a bloody battle in order to regain his kingdom.
In hopes of avenging his father's death as well as of liberating the kingdom from Turkish annexation, Vlad III Dracula, renowned as Vlad Tepes (Vlad the Impaler), raises an army and sets a bloody revolution ablaze that hastily sweep throughout the land. As war rages on, he becomes all the more murderous and sadistic, growing particularly fond of impaling his victims and publicly display their bodies by hanging them alongside walls and from trees. In response, the Church spreads rumors about him, saying that he, apart from being a cold-blooded killer, is, amongst other things, a blood-sucking vampire. But neither does the rumors hardly concern him nor do they weaken his aim to settle a score with his traitorous brother Radu, who, despite that Vlad rescues his peoples from oppression, sides with the enemy.
