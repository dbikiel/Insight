Set 5 years in the future. After years without rain fire engulfs the entire city.
New South Wales (Australia), 2012. Global warming caused temperatures to rise 2Â° worldwide. Australia suffers permanent drought. Ever scarcer potable water has become the main contraband. The fire department is the key service coordinating other branches, even the police, in emergencies. Now a storm threatens the vast suburbs of metropolitan state capital Sydney, coordinate David Langmore is given emergency powers. Alas water supply is insufficient, and the fire knocks out the electric power, hence everything else. Even devoted medical and public professionals are distracted by loved ones in urgent danger. A TV reporter is on the trace of a corrupt deal between useless state PM Angela Boardman and the power company.
Sydney (Australia), five years from now. There has been no rainfall for over 200 days. The city has nearly run out of water and is fast becoming reliant on its de-salination plant. During a severe heat wave the city is ringed by bushfires which simultaneously break their containment lines leaving Sydney under siege and without sufficient water to defend itself. Stars Cameron Daddo, Vince Colosimo, George Parker, Les Hill and Rachael Carpani.
