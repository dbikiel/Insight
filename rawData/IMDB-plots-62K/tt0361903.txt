Calm of the mountain village is disturbed by the investigation on stray sheep.
Four shephards, living in Armenian highlands, cut a stray sheep for a dinner. Revaz, their neighbour and owner of the sheep, soon appears. Shephards even manage to agree on "ransom" but novice police lieutenant interferes with the deal trying to start an official investigation.
