On December 8, 1995, at the age of 43, Jean-Dominque Bauby, editor-in-chief of ELLE Magazine, suffered from a stroke and fell into a coma. When Bauby awoke he found himself completely speechless and paralyzed. In Locked-In Syndrome, director Jean-Jacques Beiniex follows Bauby's efforts to write The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, which was later adapted into a critically acclaimed film.
