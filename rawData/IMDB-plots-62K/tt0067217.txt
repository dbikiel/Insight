An over-burdened doctor struggles to find meaning in his life while a murderer stalks the halls of his hospital.
Dr. Herbert Bock (George C. Scott), the chief of medicine in a New York City teaching hospital, is contemplating suicide. He's impotent, his wife has left him, and his children aren't speaking to him. His hospital is also suffering from a recent spate of inexplicable deaths. In the midst of these setbacks, Bock is romantically drawn to the much younger Barbara Drummond (Dame Diana Rigg), whose father is a patient. As Barbara restores Bock's will to live, it turns out that the hospital deaths are murders.
Dr. Herbert Bock (George C. Scott) is chief of medicine in a major teaching hospital. His wife has left him, he is impotent, and his children have disowned him. He is toying with the idea of suicide when patients begin dying, not from complications, but from the erroneous treatments the Hospital is giving them. People in the wrong beds are given wrong medicines, sent to operating theaters for incorrect surgery, and found in waiting rooms dead of natural causes. Barbara Drummond (Dame Diana Rigg) has come to take her comatose father back to the Sioux reservation, where he operates a clinic, and they each reach out to each other for emotional support, as a shadowy figure stalks the patients and staff of the hospital.
