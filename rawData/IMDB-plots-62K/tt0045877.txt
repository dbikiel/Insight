Two fishermen pick up a psychotic escaped convict who tells them that he intends to murder them when the ride is over.
Two friends on a fishing trip pick up a stranded motorist who turns out to be a psychotic escaped convict. This sociopath has already murdered other good Samaritans in his efforts to evade authorities. He sadistically taunts and threatens the two men and perversely delights in telling them that he has them both marked for death sometime before the end of the trip. His destination is a ferryboat in Baja, California, which he hopes will help him get to the mainland. The hostages hope to stay alive long enough to escape or be rescued by Mexican authorities.
While traveling in a fishing trip to San Felipe, the draftsman Gilbert Bowen and his friend, the garage owner Roy Collins give a ride to a stranger. Sooner they learn that the man is the psychopath serial-killer Emmett Myers, who has escaped from prison and wants to reach Santa Rosalia in Mexico. The sadistic criminal also tells them that he will kill them in the end of the line.
Two old friends, Roy Collins and Gilbert Bowen, are driving south into Mexico for a one week fishing trip. They'd been there once before as young men and there's some nostalgia attached to the trip though family man Bowen admits early on that he already misses his wife and kids. When they see a car broken down by the side of the road, they offer its occupant a lift. It doesn't take long before they realize they've picked up the notorious Emmett Myers, who is desperately trying to evade authorities and get to Mexico. He's left a trail of good Samaritans who have given him a lift and are now dead. While the police chase them down, Collins and Bowen will be driven to the breaking point by the madman.
