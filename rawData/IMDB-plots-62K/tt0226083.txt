When this picture opens, you see a large book mounted on an easel. An old student is seen poring over old manuscripts when he advances toward the book, and by the aid of some mysterious power he causes an old man, a clown and a pretty girl to emerge therefrom, turning the page each time and taking a different person from the page in view. Each tries to make love to the maiden, when they are immediately returned to the place from whence they came. Marvelously mystical.
