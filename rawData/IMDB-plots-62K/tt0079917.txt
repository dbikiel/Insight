Nineteen year old Angela Bailey has self esteem issues based on comments by her overly critical mother, with who she lives and who absconds with whatever money she makes working as a hairdresser. Her mother would be satisfied with Angela just keeping this job and marrying her ex-boyfriend Daryl Whipple, who operates his own ice cream truck. Angela hates Daryl, who is following her in an effort for her to get back together with him. As such, Angela dreams of getting away literally and figuratively from her life, preferably somewhere overseas. One of her hairdressing clients, famous model Madeline Stone, thinks that Angela would make a good model and introduces her to a fashion photographer named Linsey. Although she doesn't fully trust Linsey, Angela agrees to pose for him, topless, for a possible advertising campaign, as she can't pass up what looks to be a lucrative opportunity. This opportunity leads to Angela living in Linsey's compound and hanging out with other models while she waits for her next big break. But Angela learns that there are some in her new life who have ulterior motives in their actions toward her. And concurrently, Daryl seems to be stepping up his intimidation tactics in stalking her. So when Angela sees an opportunity for her dream, she leaps at it, unless someone stops her altogether.
