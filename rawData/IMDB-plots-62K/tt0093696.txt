London in the early 1960s. The life of a couple is upset by the coming of a British Secret Service Agent who moves in across the street.
How well do you know your neighbors, your close friends? What if the FBI asked you if they could use your home to spy on them? This is the premise behind "Pack of Lies." Based on a true story, during the Cold War, a British family is asked by the British Secret Service (MI-5) if their home might be used to conduct a surveillance operation on the neighbors across the street. The family across the street is anything, but what they seem. Instead, they are an intelligence conduit for the KGB spying on the British navy. The stress on the family becomes palpable as they deal with the taciturn officers of MI-5 and must face the fact that their friendship is based on something completely false. How will they deal with it? What will it do to their own family?
