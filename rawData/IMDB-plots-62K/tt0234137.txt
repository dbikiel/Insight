Kate's fired from a women's magazine for writing about BJs, based on own experience as requested. She gets a last chance - 2500 happy, perky words on finding/keeping that perfect man. She tells about her relationships.
When her rather explicit copy is rejected, magazine journalist Kate is asked by her editor to come up with an article on loving relationships instead, and to do so by the end of the day. This gets Kate thinking back over her own various experiences, and to wondering if she is in much of a position to write on the subject.
