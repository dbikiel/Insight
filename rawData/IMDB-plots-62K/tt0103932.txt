At 22, Céline receives several shocks: her father dies and she learns she was adopted; she rejects her inheritance, so her fiancé jilts her. She's suicidal. A nurse sees her weeping in public and takes her home. Her mother hires the nurse, Geneviève, to care for Céline; Geneviève imposes the same work and meditation regime she herself used to recover from similar depression two years before. The film plays out the resulting dynamics: Céline has mystical success in meditation, and neighbor children discover she has healing powers. Yet life remains painful. Meanwhile, the friendship is now the center of Geneviève's life. When Céline leaves, Geneviève must cope anew with loss.
