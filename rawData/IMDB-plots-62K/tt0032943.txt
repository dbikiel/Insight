Mr. and Mrs. Bennet have five unmarried daughters, and Mrs. Bennet is especially eager to find suitable husbands for them. When the rich single gentlemen Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy come to live nearby, the Bennets have high hopes. But pride, prejudice, and misunderstandings all combine to complicate their relationships and to make happiness difficult.
In the early 19th century in the English village of Meryton, the arrival of wealthy bachelors, most notably Mr. Darcy, stirs up the families with single daughters. Among those is the Bennet family, with five eligible daughters, including the spirited Elizabeth and her pretty older sister, Jane. As Mrs. Bennet aggressively tries to pair off her girls, Elizabeth crosses swords with the imperious Darcy.
