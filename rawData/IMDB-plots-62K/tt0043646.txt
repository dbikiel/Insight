During the 1950s Hollywood, an independent producer unwisely opens an old can of worms when he decides to make a movie about the 1929 unsolved murder of a famous silent-film director.
Hollywood 1950: The successful producer Larry O'Brian arrives in Los Angeles to found a motion picture company. He buys an old studio which was unused since the days of silent movies. He's shown the office where the famous director Franklin Farrara was shot. The case hasn't been solved until now, although there were many suspects. O'Brian becomes fascinated by the subject and wants to shoot a movie about it. He investigates himself and soon gets into danger himself.
Stage producer Larry O'Brien comes to Hollywood with the intentions of getting into independent-film production. While looking for story material he comes across a deserted film lot which, it appears, was last used by a director who was mysteriously murdered many years ago, in the silent-film era. He thinks the story would make a good film and, while tracking down details of the long-forgotten mystery, finds himself involved in the mystery as the director's killer also tries to put O'Brien out of the way in order to silence the investigation. A lot of old names---some real, some not---from Hollywood history---some real, some not, some close---are dug up until the mystery has been solved. Semi-based on the unsolved murder of director William Desmond Taylor.
