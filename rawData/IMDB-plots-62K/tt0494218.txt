This is one VIP list you don't want to be on! LA club people have a 'killer' party on a private yacht, except the boat is haunted by the original owner Samantha who died on the maiden voyage.
In the LA Club scene, everybody's somebody if you're on "the list". A hot club promoter plans a killer yacht party but strange things start to happen when his girlfriend turns up dead and they suspect the boat is haunted. On the yacht's maiden voyage, a millionaire's wife died in a tragic accident - and now it appears she doesn't like people on her boat. As the night goes on, more of the club goers meet tragic and suspicious deaths. Infidelity, secrets and murder have turned this excursion into anything but a party boat.
