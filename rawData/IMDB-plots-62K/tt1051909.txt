In 1907, a group of men climb an unconquered peak in the last unmapped region of Japan.
It is early twentieth century and two groups are setting out to scale and map Mount Tsurugidake in Toyama Prefecture of northern Japan. It is the last peak to be climbed by man. One group is from the Japanese army, while another group is comprised of amateur climbers and enthusiasts. The two have the same purpose and direction, but the climbs soon become a race.
