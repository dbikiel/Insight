This is the story of child psychologists Dr. Laurie and Joseph Braga and their involvement in one of the worst child sex abuse scandals in the U.S.
Horrendous acts of sexual abuse were discovered at Miami's Country Walk Day Care Center in 1984. The ensuing investigations required unprecedented work and a pair of University of Miami psychologists were called upon for assistance. This case paved the way for a successful legislation in the protection of children during court proceedings and mandatory finger printing of adults who work with young children.
