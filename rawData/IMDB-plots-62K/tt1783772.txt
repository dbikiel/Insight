Stand-up comic Ricky Gervais has his second HBO special.
Taped in Chicago in front of a live audience, Ricky's second HBO stand-up special is, just like his first, a compilation of his best material from his previous UK specials, but presented to the American audience. He talks about God and religion, the recession, addiction, famine and plenty more.
