An editor offers Reese (actress/bartender) $100,000 for her recently dead mom's letters from her novelist dad. She heads home from NYC to get them. Her dad lives in the garage while two strangers live in the house.
Actress Reese Holden has been offered a small fortune by a book editor if she can secure for publication the love letters that her father, a reclusive novelist, wrote to her mother, who has since passed away. Returning to Michigan, Reese finds that an ex-grad student and a would-be musician have moved in with her father, who cares more about his new friends than he does about his own health and well-being.
