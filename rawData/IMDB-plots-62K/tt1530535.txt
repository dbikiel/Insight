"Magnetic Rose" is about what happens when a deep space corporate freighter is called upon to investigate a distress signal from what ought to be a derelict space station. The space station is run by the deranged AI imprint of a lovelorn, jaded opera diva, who controls the station's functions, including its life support systems and (to more dramatic effect) its VR holography and supporting nano-technical systems.
