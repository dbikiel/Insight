The daughter of a desert chief kidnaps a member of the French Foreign Legion in the hopes of wooing him.
Born of a Spanish mother and an Arabian father, Zaida, granddaughter of Sheik Yusiff Ben Hamad, insists that she will have only a Christian husband, and as a result the sheik anticipates trouble from Kada, a desert renegade, who warns that he will have her at all costs. When Kada threatens Jerry and Joe, two American showmen who project movies at desert carnivals, Zaida vanquishes him at the point of a rapier. At a desert garrison where she and her grandfather are guests of the major, Zaida meets Captain Colton and has him abducted; when all her feminine wiles fail to win him, she almost succeeds with jealousy when Kada's tribesmen attack the garrison. Jerry and his pal save the day by projecting a film of attacking Arabs that terrorizes the tribesmen.
