Seven women approach the age of 50, but despite personal setbacks, they do not intend to give up their ambitions and dreams. During their annual cycling holiday through France, their friendship is put to the test. Beforehand there are already problems to get together, but the journey continues. What should be a nice cycling holiday in Normandy soon develops into personal problems and quarrels. One of the friends has cheated with the husband of another friend. The happiest appears to be the woman who is the worst, but her friends find it difficult to involve her because she has cancer. The women maintain themselves during the trip by making cynical jokes.
