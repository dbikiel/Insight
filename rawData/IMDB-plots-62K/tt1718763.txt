An inspired experimental chemist, wakes up in a New Orleans jail, accused of arson that's linked to an illegal drug-manufacturing ring. Suffering from amnesia, he's unexpectedly released on bail, determined to find his missing girlfriend.
The dreams that occurs are linked to the future and past. In the dreams, it's like a passage to a realm of travel. That takes the person forwards or backwards in time. Being able to know what is about to happen to yourself. Like the person dies and is re-born or brought back to life in a different time and as a different person. The underlying story is the same, MORALITY. Should you/me/they take a certain path or if they choose the other option, they live a different way... All based on MORALITY and goodness
