A troubled young Glaswegian woman dreams of becoming a Nashville country star.
Fresh out of jail, after one year, for narcotics possession, Rose-Lynn Harlan (Jessie Buckley) is a twenty-three-year-old working-class girl from Glasgow, Scotland, who tries to rectify her chaotic life: foul-mouthed, streetwise, rebellious, and free-spirited, Rose-Lynn reunites with her children, older Wynonna (Daisy Littlefield) and younger Lyle (Adam Mitchell), cared for during her imprisonment by their grandmother Marion (Dame Julie Walters), who openly despises her daughter's lifestyle. A worker in the bakery of a shopping center for twenty years, Marion struggles to understand her daughter, who becomes determined to travel Nashville, Tennesse to become a famous country singer. Due to a lack of resources and her low-rate academic studies, Rose-Lynn tries to return to her former job as a singer in the Grand Ole Opry, a country bar, having been fired by owners Jackie (Janey Godley) and Alan (Craig Parkinson) after they learn about her conviction. Thanks to Marion's good name, Rose-Lynn gets a job as a cleaning lady in the house of Susannah (Sophie Okonedo), an upper-class woman married to James, and mother of little Rory (Ryan Kerr) and Nell (Nicole Kerr). Gifted with a powerful talent, charisma, cheek, and voice, one day, Rose-Lynn is discovered singing in her daily work by Susannah, who befriends Rose-Lynn and decides to help her to travel to Nashville by throwing a fund-raising party especially for her. Therefore, troubles are around the corner: Wynonna and Lyle are time and time again neglected by a mother unable to reconcile with them who hides their existence to Susannah, James mistrusts Rose-Lynn by the way that Susannah is interested in her, and Marion sends an ultimatum forcing her to make a choice between her dream to be singer, or her reality to be mother. Troubled, auto-destructive and badly influenced by her friend and occasional lover Elliot (James Harkness), a fan of alcohol, night and partying, Rose-Lynn finds herself trapped in a crossroad struggling against her worst enemy: herself.
