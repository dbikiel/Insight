A young, frustrated woman is married to a famous choreographer. She has everything material she wants. clothes. a fancy home. jewelry. servants. except one thing: her husband refuses to have sex with her because she wants to get pregnant and have a child. Her husband does not want to have children because he feels they'd be too much responsibility and will interfere with his career.
