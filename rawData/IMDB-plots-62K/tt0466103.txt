The genre of the film DUST could be called fantastic realism or existential drama with elements of the fantastic. Dust means the haste in which people live. Dust is a common misconception, the natural clogging up of the brain. Specks of dust how scientists perceive people, scientists who think they know more than anyone else about the universe.
