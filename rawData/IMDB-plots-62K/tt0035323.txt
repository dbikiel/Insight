A crook dressed as Superman commits a series of robberies. The real Superman must work fast to counter the bad publicity.
"Friend turned foe" reads the newspaper headline. But Lois Lane suspects there's more to the story of Superman turning into a jewel thief and bank robber. And, of course, Clark Kent, knows it can't be true. But someone is out there committing crimes--and he's doing it dressed like Superman. Clark Kent finally meets the impostor at the opera. And that's where the impostor meets the real Superman. Catching the low-class crook is easy. But behind the cheap gangster is a powerful crime boss. And he proves more resourceful than his stooge.
In this animated short, someone is impersonating the Man of Steel and committing a series of robberies. Lois Lane is dubious but when Superman steals jewels while she and Clark Kent are at the opera, Superman is well placed to get to the bottom of it. His impersonator leads him to the criminal mastermind behind it all and quickly overcomes his foe.
