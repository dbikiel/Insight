A reindeer boy named Niko dreams about flying like his father, whom he has never met. Despite constant mocking from others, he sneaks out of his home valley to take flying lessons from Julius, a flying squirrel.
This is a movie about Niko, a reindeer boy in Lapland, who has heard that his father is one of the famous flying reindeers of Santa Claus. Niko dreams of being able to fly. His friend and mentor Julius, a squirrel, tries to keep an eye on the boy. One day Niko overhears how a pack of wolves plans to go to Santa's place on Korva-fjell and eat all the reindeers there. Niko and Julius have a near escape from the dreadful pack and are joined by Vilma, the beautiful weasel. Chased by the wolves and their leader, the gruel Black Wolf, the three manage to get to the top of the mountain, where Santa resides. The Flying reindeer squad does not believe Nikos tale about the wolves nor that he is the son of one of them. But when the wolves finally arrive, Niko proves that he is fearless and therefore able to fly. Niko meets his proud father. The wolves are beaten and Santa leaves for his big ride on Christmas eve. He invites Niko into his troops of flying reindeers, but he refuses. Family and friends comes first.
