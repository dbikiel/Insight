Ken Maynard, Hoot Gibson and Bob Steele, the Trail Blazers, have been summoned to Death Valley to apprehend the gang robbing the stagecoaches of gold shipments. Arriving in town they learn from the Marshal that Jim Kirk, the town;s most-respected citizen has opened is is operating profitably a new gold mine, and learn that none of the stolen gold has ever been recovered. Bob spies an escaped convict and makes him introduce Bob as an outlaw so Bob can join the gang and learn who the leader is. Complications arise when his first assignment is to kill Maynard and Gibson.
After losing several gold shipments to stagecoach robbers, a local businessman calls in the Trail Blazers (Ken, Hoot and Bob) to halt the robberies and find out how the perpetrators have gotten the stolen gold out of town without a trace.
Gold shipments have been stolen but the gold has not reappeared so the Trail Blazers have been called in. Ken Maynard and Hoot Gibson are known and arrive as themselves. But Bob Steele is not known and he works his way into the gang by posing as an outlaw. His first job is to kill Ken and Hoot which he appears to do. Ken learns the gold bars are reformulated back to gold ore but then the outlaws learn that Ken and Hoot are not dead and that Bob is their partner.
