Based on the novel by Graham Greene, this is a story of a French advocate Chavel (Sir Anthony Hopkins), who, while imprisoned by the Germans during the occupation, trades his material possessions to another prisoner in exchange for his life when condemned to the firing squad. At the end of the war, Chavel, posing as one of the other prisoners, returns to his house, which is now occupied by Therese (Dame Kristin Scott Thomas), the sister of the prisoner, to whom he traded his possessions, and who bitterly awaits the return of the man who had indirectly caused the death of her brother. His real identity unknown to Therese, Chavel is invited to stay as a caretaker, and to identify Chavel should he return to the house. The relationship between Chavel and Therese develops until one night, someone calling himself Chavel (Sir Derek Jacobi) turns up at their doorstep.
After willing his estate to another man's family in order to save his own life in a Nazi prison, Chavel (Sir Anthony Hopkins) returns to his erstwhile home in disguise, where he meets Therese (Dame Kristin Scott Thomas), the sister of the man who died in his place. Taking a job as a groundskeeper, he begins to fall in love with her. When a mysterious man (Sir Derek Jacobi) arrives claiming to be Chavel, the real Chavel must discover the man's true identity while preserving his own relationship with Therese.
