A lesbian bachelorette weekend goes awry when one of the brides admits she's never had an orgasm.
When a group of friends gather in a woodsy cabin to celebrate the marriage of Andi and Lu, it starts off like any other similar gathering. Distant friends catch up, drinks flow freely, and spirits soar. It's all well and good and fun until, mid-drunken-mumble, it comes out that Lu's never had an orgasm. That news comes as a wee bit of a shock to Andi and things take a drastic shift. Preexisting personal issues creep in, emotions run high, friction wears away the jovial surface, and crap gets all kinds of real. Secrets come out, tensions mount, and relationships across the board are put to the fire. Thet all deal with real, relatable problems in real relatable ways. Over the course of the weekend, and sandwiched between foul-mouthed outbursts, they reflect on trust, honesty, desire, and the various tricky things that so often trip up relationships. It all paints a funny, poignant portrait of female friendship, romantic entanglements, and life in general.
