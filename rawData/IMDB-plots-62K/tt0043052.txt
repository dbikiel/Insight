A former war hero and midget car racer meets his match in a feisty reporter who blames his reckless tactics for an accidental racing death.
Mike Brannon is a former war hero turned midget car racer. His ruthless racing tactics have made him successful but the fans consider him a villain and boo him mercilessly. Independent, beautiful reporter Regina Forbes tries to interview him but is put off by his gruff chauvinism, and when Brannon's daredevil tactics cause the death of a fellow driver, he finds himself a pariah in the sport thanks to her articles. When she finds him earning money as a barnstorming daredevil driver hoping for a comeback, they begin to become mutually attracted.
This is a good solid story about an aggressive race driver trying to make it to the big times. The cars are midgets, and you get a great tour of the racing business, the ups and downs of a driver in 1950. If you are a racing fan, you will feel as if you were transported back in time to the post war years of America. There are scenes of engine assembly. The pit crews, sponsors and many other areas of racing, fans, sponsors and the tracks themselves are all on display the director really does a great job of recording for all time this snap shot of America and her race cars. Clark Gable battles his way all the way up to the Indy 500, even in 1950 it was The Race the fastest and longest race in the world, and Irony, Morality, romance, thrills and spills are all part of this classic film. This was done in black and white and the absence of color does not hurt the performance of the King of Hollywood and his first lady Barbara Stanwick in her prime strong confident and very sexy with a wardrobe that would make any woman envious even today. I loved the shoe scene where she is conducting the papers business and trying on shoes at the same time. This is are great movie and well worth your time to see, racing and two Hollywood greats at their best.
