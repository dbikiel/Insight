The life of pioneering singer Chavela Vargas, from her birth in Costa Rica in 1919 to her death in Mexico in 2012.
Through its lyrical structure, Chavela will take viewers on an evocative, thought-provoking journey through the iconoclastic life of game-changing artist Chavela Vargas. Centered around never before-seen interview footage of Chavela shot 20 years before her death in 2012, and guided by the stories in Chavela's songs, and the myths and tales others have told about her - as well as those she spread about herself - the film weaves an arresting portrait of a woman who dared to dress, speak, sing, and dream her unique life into being.
Known as a raucous, entertaining raconteur, Chavela chose the stories she liked best, breathed life into them and made them manifest. In her amazing journey from a 14-year-old rejected runaway from Costa Rica to world renowned, Grammy winning Mexican icon, this dream weaver took bits and pieces of who she was and who she wanted to be and wove them into reality. Although she didn't officially "come out" until she was 81 years old, Chavela carefully crafted a public persona as a powerful, rebellious, free spirited outsider, a sexy sexual outlaw who blazed her own unique trail until she left the physical plane at the tender age of 93.
The singer Chavela Vargas won a name for herself first in Mexico and later throughout the world mainly for her performance of traditional ranch eras. These songs were composed mainly of men and mostly spoke of unrequited love for women, fatigue of the world and loneliness. Chavela interpreted them with his own rhythm and his rough and vulnerable voice.
