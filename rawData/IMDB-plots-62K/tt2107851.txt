Having experienced mad youthful hopes, people usually agree to a role of the participant of a mass meeting. But some all life feel in themselves a force and mission from above.

They go, play a performance, go, play, fly, play, drink, quarrel, go, are reconciled, drink, love, hate, live, live, play, live.
