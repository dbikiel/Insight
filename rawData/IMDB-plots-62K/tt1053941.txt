An intelligent middle-aged couple (lecturer Varzumov and philologist Lera) live in a one-room apartment in a provincial town. Their routine existence is boring and monotonous. Not a trace is left of their once tender relationship. Their cheerless life is overturned by an extraordinary event when their cramped flat is occupied by a group of special service policemen who are waiting for the terrorist from the flat opposite. Only then the main characters finally understand: things are never so bad that they can't get any worse!
