In 1950s Connecticut, a housewife faces a marital crisis and mounting racial tensions in the outside world.
Cathy is the perfect 50s housewife, living the perfect 50s life: healthy kids, successful husband, social prominence. Then one night she stumbles in on her husband Frank, kissing another man, and her tidy world starts spinning out of control. In her confusion and grief, she finds consolation in the friendship of their African-American gardener, Raymond - a socially taboo relationship that leads to the further disintegration of life as she knew it. Despite Cathy and Frank's struggle to keep their marriage afloat, the reality of his homosexuality and her feelings for Raymond open a painful, if more honest, chapter in their lives.
Frank and Cathy Whittaker are, as far as the outside world can tell, the perfect couple. Young, attractive and well-off, they represent all that middle-class America is supposed to be in the 1950s. Below the surface however, all is not as it seems. Cathy feels unfulfilled and begins to realize that her marriage is not what it should be. When she discovers her husband making love to a man in his office late one evening, she begins to understand why. She also begins to develop an interest in Raymond Deagan, their African-American gardener. Raymond is intelligent, witty and an art lover. In many ways, Cathy has found a soul-mate. Trying to support her husband as he tries to "cure" his homosexuality and the social taboo of having been seen in public with a black man does not augur well for her however.
