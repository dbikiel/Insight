Inside a box full of curio, a puppet who is recently freed from his strings explores a dusty and forlorn commercial area. The explorer becomes ensnared into miniature tailor shop by baby-faced dolls.
Adapted from Polish writer Bruno Schulz's book, Stephen Quay and Timothy Quay's cornucopia of eerie enchantment portrays a dark underworld which envelops an emaciated puppet. Little by little, a stringless marionette wanders more and more into this desolate realm of strange mechanical rituals, only to be devoured by a horrible and carceral isolation, as a triplet of sinister female figures watches his every move from afar.
A man closes up a lecture hall; he reaches into a box and snips the string holding a gaunt puppet. Released, the puppet warily explores the darkened rooms about him. Screws twist out of objects and move about. A boy doll catches light with a mirror, shining it around: he spotlights the gaunt explorer. An adult female doll stands with breasts exposed. Mechanical spools and wheels turn. The gaunt man investigates. Four doll men surround him, dress him in colorful clothes, invite him to look inside displays that include drawings of penile skeletons. Female dolls awkwardly rotate their arms from broken shoulders. The gaunt man watches. Bruno Schultz is quoted.
