A young boy tries to get a pair of Christmas shoes for his dying mother, while a lawyer tries to deal with the break-up of his marriage.
Two separate stories mesh - in the first, a young music teacher, Maggie Andrews, begins dying of a heart condition and her son Nathan tries to get a pair of Christmas shoes for her before she dies. In the second, lawyer Robert Layton and his wife Kate are slowly drifting apart and the matter comes to a head during Christmas when Kate takes over for Maggie for the school choir and declines a job in Robert's firm. When Robert's mother passes away, he begins to reconsider things and his and Nathan's paths cross on Christmas Eve as Nathan tries to raise the money for the shoes and Robert tries to get a present for his daughter.
The plot interweaves two different stories:One story involves Maggie Andrews, a young music teacher who is terminally ill (the result of heart failure), and her son Nathan (who tries to get a pair of Christmas shoes for her before she dies, and who collects empty cans to raise the money). The other story involves Robert Layton, a lawyer who's marriage to his wife Kate is failing (the matter comes to a head during Christmas, when Kate takes over for Maggie for the school choir and declines a job in Robert's firm); when Robert's mother passes away, he begins to reconsider how his life is going. Robert's and Nathan's paths cross on Christmas Eve at a local shoe store. Nathan learns that he is five dollars short of the money needed to buy his mother the shoes. Nathan begins crying, whereupon Robert gives Nathan the money needed to complete the purchase. Nathan is thus able to buy the shoes for his mother and give them to her before she dies.
