After local grocery clerk rescues a baby from an escaped lion, a circus owner builds him into an attraction but balks when he falls in love with his sister.
A lion escapes Nick Coster's carnival and is captured by grocery clerk Matt Varney whom Nick brings into the show and eventually makes chief lion tamer. When Nick finds out Matt has fallen for his convent-bred sister Mary he makes him go into the cage with the insane lion Caesar.
Nick Coster runs a traveling carnival on a marginal basis and supplements its income by having pickpockets work the crowd. Because of his disdain for carnival life, he has pledged to keep his innocent younger sister away from the carnival and its workers. He does have warm feelings for Flo, the show's gypsy fortune teller, who takes offense to his derogatory view of the way they make a living. The show's top attraction is lion tamer Hoffman the Great, whose drinking and cruelty to his big cats is problematic. When one of the lions escapes and threatens a baby, small town grocery clerk Matt Varney is able to stand up to the beast and captures it. Nick realizes Matt's worth and grooms him to replace the unreliable Hoffman. However, when Matt and Nick's sister fall in love, Coster's feelings toward the sincere young man sour quickly.
