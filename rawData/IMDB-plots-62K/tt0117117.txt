The deportation of 4000 Jews from Budapest to Auschwitz in July 1944, as told by George Tabori, and how the narrator's mother escaped it, owing to coincidence, courage and some help from where you'd least expect it.
From the director of The White Rose and The Nasty Girl, comes this stunning adaptation of Hungarian author George Tabori's autobiographical, somewhat surreal novel. Shifting between Nazi-occupied Budapest and present-day Berlin, the film artfully depicts the true story of how Tabori's mother Elsa escaped deportation to Auschwitz.
