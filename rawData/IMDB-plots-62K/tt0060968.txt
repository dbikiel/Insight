A sleazy evangelist makes a play for a small town's local tramp, but is shocked to learn that she prefers a local black kid over him. Furious, he stirs up the town against the couple.
On a hot night in Dixie, the local shanty tramp heads out for adventure and leaves disaster in her wake. The lust she excites in the local men leads to fights, murders, lynch mobs, ruined reputations, and broken homes.
