Carmen's caught in a virtual reality game designed by the Kids' new nemesis, the Toymaker. It's up to Juni to save his sister, and ultimately the world.
Under-age agents Juni and Carmen Cortez set out on their newest most mind-blowing mission yet: journeying inside the virtual reality world of a 3-D video game designed to outsmart them, as the awe-inspiring graphics and creatures of gaming come to real life. Relying on humor, gadgetry, bravery, family bonds and lightning-quick reflexes, the Spy Kids must battle through tougher and tougher levels of the game, facing challenges that include racing against road warriors and surfing on boiling lava, in order to save the world from a power hungry villain.
Juni Cortez has now retired from being a spy and is trying to live a normal life. But he gets thrown back into the spy world, when his sister Carmen Cortez is kidnapped by the Toymaker. Carmen is trapped inside the Toymaker's video game, and the only way Juni can reach her is by going into the third dimensional world himself.
This is the third movie of this series. The premise of the movie is one that Alexa Vega (Carmen Cortez) is caught in a virtual reality game and Daryl Sabara (Juni Cortez) her brother must get her out. The spy kids go into this video game to fight the Toymaker played by Sylvester Stallone. If you remember the movie `Tron', you will see about the same thing in this one. The characters in the game have a certain number of lives, and they must fight to get to the fifth level to win. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy)
