The film chronicle of the legendary 1969 music festival.
An intimate look at the Woodstock Music &amp; Art Festival held in Bethel, NY in 1969, from preparation through cleanup, with historic access to insiders, blistering concert footage, and portraits of the concertgoers; negative and positive aspects are shown, from drug use by performers to naked fans sliding in the mud, from the collapse of the fences by the unexpected hordes to the surreal arrival of National Guard helicopters with food and medical assistance for the impromptu city of 500,000.
The original "Woodstock" documentary film, with added elements including performances by bands who were not included in the original film, bonus footage of those who were, and a post-credits tribute to activists, performers, and organizers who passed on since the original release.
This definitive footage of 1960's hippie counterculture and its music is reprised and transcended once more via the medium of cinema. This documentary in an vibrant attitude of youth and rebellion and it also brings together super groups and artists such as The Who, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Ten Years After, Jefferson Airplane and many, many more over a three day period of drugs, rain, peace and love. This film starts with the concerts conception and the first foundations laid to its finish and its inevitable dismantling. Entwined with interviews from the local townsfolk to hippie talk from the red-eyed flower people in this split-screen musical montage of some 300,000 laid-back, groovy star children.
