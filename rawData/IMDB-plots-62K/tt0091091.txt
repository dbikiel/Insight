Multi-genre flick (western, martial arts, comedy, adventure, etc.) with an all-star cast about a man who returns to his home town, buys everything in sight, and tries to improve its municipal (and his personal) profits by sabotaging a train so the passengers all have to stop in his town and spend lots o' money! Throw in various subplots involving some Japanese swordsmen, some bungling bankrobbers (one of whom is the head of security), and a gang of no-goods who try to mess up the town.
A Far East meets Western adventure with an all-star cast, former outlaw Foon-Tin Ching (Sammo Hung Kam-Bo) tries to make amends for his past by attempting to return prosperity to his home town of Han Shui. He plans to sabotage an express train boarded by wealthy merchants on their way to Shanghai, cut their journey short and invite them to his town to spend money on its amenities. However, a large group of ruthless bandits want to infiltrate the train, ultimately aiming to steal a treasure scroll in the possession of three Japanese samurais who were on board the express.
The maiden voyage of a glamorous new express train from Shanghai, called "The Millionaires Express", has a little more excitement than was planned for the high government officials, wealthy merchants and their wives, who make up most of the passengers.
