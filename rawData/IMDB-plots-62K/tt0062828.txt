Is there a link between the murder of five foreign sailors from the East whose bodies have been found on the San Pedro waterfront and the issue of one million counterfeit dollars in the USA? Don Owens, an undercover agent, assisted by Angie, a beautiful but embittered widow who has fallen for him, does his best to untangle the knot...
A man is found dead in a sleazy dockside bar. It happens that he was an Olympic Swimming Champion.
On the other side of town police discover that counterfeit dollars are being passed in the central areas, drugs are pushed without hindrance.
A hit man is hired to fulfil an important contract.
Another murder is committed on the dockside, one thing is certain, all the evidence on each count is connected. The conclusion being that the mobsters have hired a Crackshot.
