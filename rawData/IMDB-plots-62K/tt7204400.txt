The effect of dark matter colliding with the earth is the opening of this film.
A family in Los Angeles finds themselves separated during a convergence of history's greatest disasters: a super volcano, a mega earthquake and a massive twister. While the world endures this near apocalyptic event, our heroes must persevere on their own skills and wit to reunite and survive.
