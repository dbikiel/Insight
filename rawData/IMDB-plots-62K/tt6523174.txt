Emma le Roux just wants to go home for the holidays. Gentle, beautiful, pacifist Emma. She's made the trip to her father's farm a thousand times. Piece of cake. But not today. Today she will cross paths with Bosman and Baz and Jay. And Boela and AJ and Piet. Bosman is the mastermind of the drug syndicate. A violent psychopath. Baz and Jay are his henchmen - violent dogs on a short leash. AJ and Boela, spoiled brats looking for validation, are on board to make a quick buck in the criminal underworld. And then there's Piet, the weakling, who is willing to do just about anything for his cousin Bosman. Emma witnesses the murder of a policeman at their hands. And they see her seeing them. Now they're hunting her down like an animal. She's easy prey, after all - it'll all be over soon. The problem is, Emma is the daughter of Jacques le Roux. And Jacques le Roux was a Special Forces soldier. The hunt isn't going according to plan. Everything starts falling apart, and fast. At first they were driven by hate and revenge. Suddenly, it's survival.
