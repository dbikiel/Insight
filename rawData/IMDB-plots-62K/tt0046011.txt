The Bowery Boys find themselves in London, in an old mansion complete with a dungeon, an ominous bell tower and the ghost of an old hangman.
Word comes to the Bowery that titled, great, great grand-uncle of Horace Debussy Jones, better known as Sach, is near death and has provided transportation to summon relatives from around the world. Sach and the Bowery Boys, Slip Mahoney, Butch Williams, Chuck Anderson and Soda Shoppe owner Louie Dumbrowsky, trade Sach's pre-paid first class ticket for lesser (much lesser) accommodations and embark for ye olde London towne. There, they find the old man, the Earl of Walsingham already surrounded by sinister Sir Edgar Whipsnade; Reggie, the obligatory Fop; the spinster Aunt Agatha; the young and seductive Lady Marcia; moronic Cousin Herbert, and Hoskins, the Butler. They, of course,are assembled in a plot to slowly poison the old Earl and to get rid of Sach and his pals.
