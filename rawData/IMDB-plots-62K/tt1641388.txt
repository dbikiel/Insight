Jack, a writer who goes to a remote meat cooler, where his agent has set it up for him, to be locked in for five days so he can meet his deadline while he writes the ending to his book.
Based on true events, BELOW ZERO is a thriller with a 'Fargo' feel. It is the story of 'Jack the Hack', a less than average, but once successful screenwriter who now faces writer's block. Desperate to meet a career-saving deadline and lock out the distractions of his troubled life, Jack arranges to be left alone and locked inside a meat cooler, with only vegetarian meals and his imagination to inspire him. As the temperature drops, the lines between reality and fiction blur, and Jack's script comes dangerously to life. Will he make the most important deadline of his career? Or is Jack 'just a hack'? While writing the script, the actual screenwriter and producer of BELOW ZERO, Signe Olynyk, arranged to have herself physically locked in the meat freezer of an abandoned, remote slaughterhouse. That's partly how this story developed. It was filmed at the same location.
This movie is based on a true story. It's about Jack, a writer who goes to a remote meat cooler where his agent has set it up for him to be locked in a meat locker for five days so he can meet his deadline while he writes the ending to his book, at Jack's request mind you. But while there the lines are blurred between reality and imagination as you see what he see's while writing his book. Are the people he met on the way there really who they say they are or is his imagination playing tricks on him? Are people dying a grizzly death by the way of the 'butcher' he wrote about?
