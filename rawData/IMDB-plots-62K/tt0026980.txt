Haworth is a show biz producer who has a number of ex-girlfriends that he has beaten over the years. He is now engaged to two girls- Lisa and Trenna. After drinking and starting a fight with Sim, Haworth is found dead in his apartment. Everyone has a reason to kill him, but most of the blame is falling on Sim and his love Trenna. If they are to be cleared, it is up to Aunt Melissa to find the killer - and she thinks she knows who is was.
