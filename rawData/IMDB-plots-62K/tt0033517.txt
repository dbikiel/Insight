Gay Lawrence, aka The Falcon, is about to depart the city to marry his fiancée, Helen Reed, when a mystery girl, Rita Mara, asks for his aid in disposing of a secret formula for making synthetic diamonds. He deliberately allows himself to be kidnapped by the gang for which Rita works. His aide, "Goldy" Locke, trails the kidnappers and brings the police. But the head of the gang escapes, and the Falcon continues the pursuit.
Detective/adventurer Gay Lawrence (a.k.a. The Falcon) gets embroiled in a case that puts a hold on his marriage to beautiful fiancée Helen Reed. Inventor Waldo Sampson has developed a formula for manufacturing synthetic diamonds that are virtually indistinguishable from real ones. The scientist only wants them used for industrial purposes, but the formula becomes the maguffin pursued by Lawrence, the police, and a greedy bevy of crooks including attractive femme fatale Rita Mara. After Sampson is apparently murdered and his formula stolen, the Falcon is not only pursued by the villains but also the police, who suspect him of the crime.
