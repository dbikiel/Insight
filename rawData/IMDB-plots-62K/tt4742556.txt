When unsuccessful actress Clarissa returns to her hometown for a wedding and tries to impress her old friends by claiming she's dating big time celebrity Chas Hunter, she suddenly finds herself in a comically false engagement when her lies go public Chas decides to join the festivities in a stunt to escape bad press.
Handsome, popular Chas Hunter, a star since childhood, wins another series lead at auditions where would be-actress Clarissa Byers is duly sent off for clumsily spilling hot coffee all over him auditioning as waitress. Frustrated to return home for her best friend's wedding, still single and without career success, she pretends to have landed a fine role and fiance: Chad. Paparazzi get wind of her lies which might compromises Chad's reputation, so his bossy ex and publicist decides he should play along and then dump her after the best friend's wedding. Charming Chad soon gets along with the party guests, even bonds with Clarissa, who starts realizing he's her kind of prince charming, until the publicist arrives to break them up for maximal publicity.
