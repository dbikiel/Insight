Photo-animated feature documentary, uniquely narrated by the 10 people who knew Bill best.
During his short life, Bill Hicks was more than just a stand-up comedian. He was a satirical icon, shocking audiences out of their comfort zones and pulling them into discussions about religion, society, consumerism and the mythical nature of the American Dream. While considered unpatriotic for his scathing commentary on American society, Hicks found huge success in the UK and Ireland. After his tragic death from pancreatic cancer at age 32, Hicks legacy lives on. In "American: The Bill Hicks Story," producers Matt Harlock and Paul Thomas artfully combine performance footage, personal photographs and powerful interviews with Hicks' family and friends, bringing this legendary and complex icon to the screen. If you don't know Hicks now, you will understand his cult following by the end of this brilliant film.
