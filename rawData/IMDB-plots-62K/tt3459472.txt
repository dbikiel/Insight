Two Belgian brass bands compete for the European title. One is Flemish (Sint-Cecilia), the other Walloon (En Avant). Sint Cecilia loses their soloist in dramatic circumstances and to ensure their participation in the contest they try to steal the very talented soloist from En Avant. The ball starts rolling and not everything will happen as planned.
At the Belgian qualification for an European brass bands competition, the Flemish (Dutch language) Sint-Cecilia is granted an exaequo as consolation prize for the death on air of its soloist and main asset. So hey go on with their stronger Walloon (francophone) compatriots En Avant. Unwilling to accept inevitable defeat on air, they device to lure away their soloist, Hugues. he can use the cash, is ambitious as a composer and can't resist the charms of his host-chairman's daughter Elke, who cheats with him on her wealthy fiance Renaat. Things starts going pear-shaped as Hugues realizes he's being used and Renaat he's cuckolded before marriage.
