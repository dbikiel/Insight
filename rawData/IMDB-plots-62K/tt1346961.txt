In a seaside Irish town, a widower sparks with a visiting horror novelist while he also begins to believe he is seeing ghosts.
Having lost his beloved wife to cancer, the dejected widower and father of two, Michael Farr, is still struggling to find his feet in the Irish seaport town of Cobh. To keep his mind occupied, Michael volunteers for the picturesque town's annual literary festival, transporting famous authors such as the self-centred American novelist, Nicholas Holden, and the quiet British ghost-story writer, Lena Morelle, to various events. Once, those two polar opposites had a meaningless fling; however--even though Nicholas is still eager to pick up where they left off--more and more, Lena finds herself attracted to the sombre Michael, whose father-in-law's eerie ghost haunts him in the dead of night. Is this dreadful apparition a tangible manifestation created by a wounded soul?
