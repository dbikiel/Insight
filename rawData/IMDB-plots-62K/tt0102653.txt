In a private school in the U.S. South, Mr. Sanders, a new choirmaster tries to reduce some of the prejudice and hostility of some of the students in his choir. Paul, a bully who feels he should be lead boy, is the worst offender. Taylor Bradshaw on the other hand is impressed by the music of Landy, a black boy, grandson of Zeke, the school caretaker. Zeke joins in some of the activities of the black community known as River Town. Sanders is also impressed by Landy's abilities and attempts to get him involved with the choir. A tragedy in the community brings the race issue to a head.
When a new teacher named Mr. Sanders begins to teach at Blanton Academy, a private school in the south, it stirs thoughts in the mind of one boy, Taylor Bradshaw, while stirring prejudice in most of the other students. After meeting Landy Allen, a Negro boy his age, Taylor begins to explore the music and lives of the "colored" people who live in Rivertown despite knowing that it could get him expelled or rejected. Landy and Taylor teach each other his own style of music as they try to get others to see past the racial barriers. A tragedy leads to a great awakening in the minds of those who still remained prejudiced at the school.
