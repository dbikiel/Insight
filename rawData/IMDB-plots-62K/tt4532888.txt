A writer which stolen his friend's work is forced to write another sad novel on the behalf of him while he is in the middle of a family fight.
In this energetic black comedy, a stone thrown through a window becomes the catalyst for a family feud between two sisters and their families. Azar's son, Babak, is to marry Mahshid, Azadeh's daughter. However, things don't quite go to plan, and what begins as tension between the two factions becomes an all-out war. When kidnapping and attempted murder are added to the mix, it is unclear if the family will ever see eye to eye. Narrated by Azar's writer son, Fahrad, the film's eclectic cast and episodic nature is reminiscent of the work of Wes Anderson.
