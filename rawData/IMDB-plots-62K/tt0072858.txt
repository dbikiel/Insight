Martial arts legend Ron van Clief stars in this action thriller about rival gangs in search of a lost "finger fighting" manual written by Bruce Lee. From the heyday of 1970s Blaxploitation and kung fu flicks, this movie demonstrates much of the same crude dialog and cut-rate film techniques usually found in those genres but succeeds by having a legitimate bad ass like van Clief in the lead role.
Three rival gangs embark on a search for Bruce Lee's handwritten "finger gifhting" manual. (Josiah Howard, "Blaxploitation Cinema: The Essential Reference guide.")
