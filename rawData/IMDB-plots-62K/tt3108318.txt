When twins attend university, their parents join them too.
Money can't buy happiness for career-driven mom Megan Mills (Kristy Swanson) or her family.

When Mike leaves her and joins Sean and Zoe in college, Megan realizes she must take drastic measures to bring her family back together. In order to save her marriage and reconnect with her children, she enrolls alongside them as a college undergrad.

Despite her attempts to help her children adjust to college life, the kids are not pleased to have their mom as a classmate. Megan only wants what is best for her family, but begins to question if she still has a part in it. With a tempting job offer waiting for her back at home, will Megan decide to drop out of campus life or does she have what it takes to graduate with family honors?From HallmarkChannel.com
