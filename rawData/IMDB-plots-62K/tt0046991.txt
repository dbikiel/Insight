In postwar London, young graduate Tony (Sir Dirk Bogarde) and his girlfriend Anne (Susan Stephen) decide to marry. Her well-to-do parents are not convinced, but they agree once he has got a Â£5.10.0 job and a 30/- a week single-room flat. The newlyweds find money fearfully tight, the flat cramped, the neighbors a trial, and her parents always hovering. Can faith conquer all? Is there some way of getting rid of tea leaves, except down the sink?
