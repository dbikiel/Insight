Gangsters kidnap the prospective son-in-law of a politician in order to secure the release of an imprisoned gang-member.
After Bade falls out of favor of Member of Parliament, Verma, he is arrested, held in a cell without any trial, and is humiliated and beaten everyday. His brother Chhotte and others conspire to secure his release by kidnapping Verma's to-be son-in-law, Shyam Singhania. Things do not go exactly as planned and Priti, Shyam's girlfriend, also gets abducted. In order to ensure Shyam's safety, she agrees to liaise between Verma and the gangsters - not knowing that she has an admirer who will do anything for her. She meets with Shyam's father as well as Verma but may end up endangering everyone's lives especially after Verma makes it clear that he will not negotiate Bade's release under any circumstance.
