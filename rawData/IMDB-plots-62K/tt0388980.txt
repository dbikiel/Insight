In the 1913 US Open, 20-year-old Francis Ouimet played golf against his idol, 1900 US Open champion, Englishman Harry Vardon.
Near the turn of the twentieth century, young Harry Vardon becomes a champion golfer but learns that his amazing skill is no match for the class boundaries that exclude him from "gentlemanly" English society. A dozen years later, a young American, Francis Ouimet, fights against the same prejudice, as well as his own father's disdain, for a chance to participate in the U.S. Open against his idol -- Harry Vardon. The struggles of both men for acceptance provides the background for an amazing contest of skills.
Long shot amateur Francis Ouimet competes in the 1913 US Open golf championship all while proving he is a winner.
