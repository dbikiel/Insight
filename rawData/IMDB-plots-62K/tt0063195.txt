All the insects on Earth become wild and attack humans, causing Armageddon.
A hydrogen bomb is lost on an Island south of Japan after the bomber carrying it flies into a huge swarm of insects and crashes. Three crew members eject, but two of them are later found dead of strange wounds while the other is found to be in a coma. A local man named George is blamed for the deaths and quickly taken into custody - scientist Nagumo travels from mainland Japan to try and help prove his innocence. Military men from the United States appear and hinder Nagumo's efforts in their ruthless search to find their lost H-bomb. But there are communist agents working on the island who want the bomb as well - soon both they and the American's are vying for possession of the weapon. Meanwhile, a lone female scientist and survivor of Nazi concentration camps, convinced that man's destructive tendencies must be put to an immediate and permanent end, plots the destruction of all mankind through the release of swarms of new and deadly insect species. In the end, the bomb is detonated and the island is destroyed along with all who know about the deadly insects, which escape into the skies.
