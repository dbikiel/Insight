The usually absent father of a chubby kid shows up to take him on a road trip.
Based on the best selling children's novels this adorable film for children and adults alike, has attended numerous international film festivals including The Berlinale where it got Special Mention by the Jury. The film has become one of the hits of 1999 with over 1 million admissions at the Spanish box office. This is a hilarious look at contemporary Madrid from the point of view of ten year old MANOLITO. Witty, funny and moving, the film has crossed-over from Spain to become a family entertainment.
