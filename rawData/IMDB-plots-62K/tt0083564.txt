A young orphan girl's adventures in finding a family that will take her.
In the depths of the 1930s, Annie (Aileen Quinn) is a fiery young orphan girl who must live in a miserable orphanage run by the tyrannical Miss Agatha Hannigan (Carol Burnett). Her seemingly hopeless situation changes dramatically when she is selected to spend a short time at the residence of the wealthy munitions industrialist, Oliver "Daddy" Warbucks (Albert Finney). Quickly, she charms the hearts of the household staff and even the seemingly cold-hearted Warbucks cannot help but learn to love this wonderful girl. He decides to help Annie find her long-lost parents by offering a reward if they would come to him and prove their identity. However, Miss Agatha Hannigan, her evil brother, Daniel Francis "Rooster" Hannigan (Tim Curry), and a female accomplice, plan to impersonate those people to get the reward for themselves, which puts Annie in great danger.
