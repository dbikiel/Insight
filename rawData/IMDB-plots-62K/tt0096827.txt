Two brothers separated at birth meet as adults and settle old scores with the killers of their father.
Appu and Raja are twin brothers who were separated soon after their birth. Years later Appu, a dwarf, has become a circus clown and is loved by everyone while Raja is a car mechanic. When Appu's love is rejected as he is a dwarf he tries to commit suicide. His mother comforts him and reveals to him that while she was pregnant with her twins their father Sethupathy was killed by four criminals Francis, Dharmaraj, Nallasivam and Satyamoorthy and also poisoned her which is the reason he turned a dwarf. Appu now decides to take revenge against the criminals but his lost twin brother Raja is framed for his crimes by mistake.
Honest police officer Sethupathi (Kamal) arrests four high profile crooks Dharmaraj (Nagesh), Francis (Delhi Ganesh), Nallasivam (Nasser) and Satyamoorthy(Jaishankar). They get out of jail, kill Sethupathi and poison his pregnant wife. She somehow gives birth to twins, who are separated and grow up as Appu (Kamal), a circus clown, and Raja (Kamal), a mechanic. Eventually Appu finds out about his father's death and plots his vengeance.
