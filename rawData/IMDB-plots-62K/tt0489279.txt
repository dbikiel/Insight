The concept is based on a true story concerning an exotic species of eels that are released in the southeast from Asia. They breathe air and can survive on land.
Two prisoners escape through the swamp land in Everglades and the search party is attacked by a giant mutant eel and is considered missing. The Animal Control agent Delmar Coates is searching a missing dog with his ex-wife Sheriff Ruth Gainey-Coates and he discovers the remains of the animal. Meanwhile members of a canoe club organize an expedition through the swamp. When Sheriff Ruth organizes a manhunt to capture the criminals, Delmar informs that his former friend, Dr. Soren Abramson, who is chasing the eel with a group of college students, is the responsible for mutant species. Sheriff Ruth organizes two teams to hunt the prisoners and the eel.
Four college students travel deep into the Florida Everglades to earn some extra credit for their biology class. Little do they know, the reason they're there is not to research eels; their professor has created a genetically modified super-eel, and they must capture it, or kill it. Meanwhile, Dr. Soren's old friend, Delmar, is also on the trail of the eel, while Delmar's ex, the sheriff, is chasing after two escaped convicts. When all of these groups converge, the results are exciting... and deadly!
