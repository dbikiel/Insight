A man who loses a very personal part of his body to cancer decides he wants it back in this offbeat black comedy.
When Martin Schwartz discovers a tumour on his testicle, he is told he will need to have both removed, but he opts for chemotherapy instead. This black comedy looks at Martin's journey through chemotherapy and the friendships he makes with the other cancer patients in his ward. Based on director Robert Schwentke's own experience.
