Before the vastness of the Siberian Taiga, at the shores of the frozen Lake Baikal, a Parisian executive fleeing from the city, will find everything he has ever dreamed of: to profoundly experience the silence, the solitude and the space.
Fed up with the hectic, senseless world he lives in, Teddy decides to settle down alone in Siberia, in the midst of winter, in a hut by the shore of Lake Baikal. After an initial period of elation in front of the splendor and magic of unspoiled nature, Teddy soon finds himself confronted with the less glossy side of things : solitude, extreme cold, the necessity to find food, danger... One night Teddy gets lost in a blizzard and would be doomed to a certain death, were it not for Aleksei, a Russian convict living hidden away in the forest nearby, who rescues him in extremis. Friendship soon blossoms between the two men...
In the ends of the world, at the end of electricity, before the vastness of the Siberian Taiga, right there, at the shores of the frozen Lake Baikal, there lie hidden all that Teddy, a Parisian executive, has ever dreamed of: to desperately flee from the urban life's void existence and profoundly experience the silence, the solitude and the space. Inexperienced and in the middle of the harsh Siberian winter, Teddy will soon need to fight with the omnipotent elements of nature, alone and insignificant against the relentless truth of the extreme cold, the hunger and the ever-present danger, with his sole refuge a weathered and humble hut. When unexpectedly, Teddy strays from his cabin amidst a severe night blizzard, he would undoubtedly encounter death itself if it weren't for Aleksei, a Russian fugitive on the run who's been living as a hermit for the past twelve years in the unwelcoming forests of Siberia. Eventually, as the two fugitives from the world embrace life's freedom, an unforeseen friendship will gradually develop, however, when Teddy ultimately realises that he's been alive inside an empty shell, what would he be willing to trade to unconditionally live a lifetime of experiences in a single year?
