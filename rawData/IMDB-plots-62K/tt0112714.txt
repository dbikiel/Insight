The year is 1952, in Quebec City. Rachel, 16, unmarried, and pregnant, works in the church. Filled with shame, she unburdens her guilt to a young priest, under the confidentiality of the confessional. In the present year of 1989, Pierre Lamontagne has returned to Quebec to attend his father's funeral. He meets up with his adopted brother, Marc, who has begun questioning his identity and has embarked on a quest for his roots that would lead them to the Quebec of the 1950s. Past and present converge in a complex web of intrinque where the answer to the mystery lies.
The film plays n two different times: One part in the past, Quebec in 1952 when Alfred Hitchcock filmed "I confess" in the in these times isolated city. And the other part in the presence, Quebec in 1994. Two brothers, Pierre and Marc, want to know their real origin and begin to discover a lot of lies and intriges. The film switches between the two plots in the present and the past in kind of flashbacks.
