This documentary follows a few groups of Furries, as a social commentary of this fandom, its stigmas and how it is perceived through sensational media coverage.
Of modern fandoms around, few are newer and least understood in mainstream Western culture than furry fandom: the fandom of anthropomorphic fantasy characters aka funny animals. This film interviews various devotees to this interest, such as their personal lives and their personal opinions on their hobby, whether it be simply an appreciation of the artistic products or wearing elaborate furry costumes complete with alternate personas. Furthermore, the internal conflict of the fandom is explored between those who struggle to maintain a carefully positive public image of the community for outsiders and those esoteric souls who insist on enjoying their hobby their way, not matter how extreme. Against the looming fear of the mainstream media determined to exploit the most sensational examples they can find, this conflict is bound to make the fur fly.
