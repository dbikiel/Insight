Biopic of Brazilian singer Tim Maia, from his childhood in Rio de Janeiro until his death at age 55, including his passage by the US, where he discovers a new style of music and is arrested for theft and drug possession.
The movie tells the story of Sebasti√£o Rodrigues Maia, one of the greatest names in brazilian music, from delivering food up to his greatest moments of fame as Tim Maia. Narrated to us by one of his closest friends, the plot tries to be as faithfull to his biography as possible, honestly displaying his highest and lowest points, remembering us how life hardly goes as we'd like it to. All that, with his beautiful music as background.
