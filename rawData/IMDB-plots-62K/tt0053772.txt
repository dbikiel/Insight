Don Juan is sent from Hell to Earth with a mission - to seduce a 20 years old virgin in order to spoil her pure wedding. The mission becomes crazy when Don Juan falls in love for the first time in centuries.
The devil has a stye in his eye, caused by the purity of a vicar's daughter. To get rid of it, he sends Don Juan up from hell to seduce the 20 year old Britt-Marie and to rob her of her virginity and her belief in love. She however can resist him and things get even turned around when Don Juan falls in love with her. The fact that he feels love for the first time now, makes him even less attractive to her and Don Juan returns to hell.
An actor presents a comedy in three acts. That story involves Satan who has developed a painful sty, which is the result of something tumultuous happening on earth. He learns from his advisers that that tumultuous thing is the pure chastity of twenty year old Nordic beauty Britt-Marie, the daughter of a vicar, she who is soon to be married to her longtime beau, Jonas. To get rid of his sty, Satan knows he has to get someone to defile Britt-Marie before her marriage, or else her purity could cause a ripple effect which would be disastrous for him beyond the sty. Satan pulls out the big guns in the form of Don Juan, who has been in hell for three hundred years and who Satan has punished with continually performing the act of seduction on women but never being able to complete the seduction to the actual act of love. Beyond Satan reducing his punishment, Don Juan agrees only if his longtime servant Pablo can also be sent to earth with him on this assignment. While Pablo can't help but try to indulge in some of earth's forbidden pleasures, Don Juan may find a slightly different soul in Britt-Marie than he anticipates and thus a slightly different challenge.
