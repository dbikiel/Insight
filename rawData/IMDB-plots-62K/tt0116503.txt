The "head" of the family is literally that - a giant head on a tiny body, who psychically controls the rest of his even weirder family.
Lance and Loretta are having a torrid affair behind her husband Howard's back. The problem is that Howard is brutal thug who is bound to catch the cheating pair sooner or later. To solve this problem, the lovers hatch a plan involving the Stackpoole family: a collection of misshapen freaks who waylay unsuspecting travellers and dissect them in gruesome experiments. Unfortunately, things don't go quite according to plan.
