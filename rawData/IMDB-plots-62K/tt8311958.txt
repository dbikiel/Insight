A woman uses her bureaucratic job to convince divorcing couples to stay together is utterly committed to getting pregnant by her husband in a future of dance parties, ritualistic orgies and fundamentalist Christianity.
Brasil, 2027. Joana, a forty-year-old civil servant, works as a notary at the divorce registration office, but her fervent Christian faith drives her to go beyond her job in an attempt to reconcile separated spouses. In order to do so, she has a secret weapon: she persuades them to join Divine Love, a group of which she is a member with her husband, Danilo who creates flower bouquets at their home. Group readings of holy writings, sermons, purifying immersion: Divine Love has everything you'd find in your average run-of-the-mill evangelical community, except that this group also likes to get involved in a bit of swinging - on the sole condition that the man's seed is reserved for his legitimate wife because "supreme pleasure comes from the divine desire to procreate life within the family. But Joana and Danilo are unable to conceive, because he is unable to reach a climax, despite his best efforts (swinging upside down on a machine being one of them). As a result, she has entirely dedicated her existence to God in the hope of a miracle (going up to pray regularly at an astonishing religious drive-in). But when the miracle becomes a reality, everything begins to get a little complicated.
In a Brazil where the Evangelical church has been integrated into all aspects of daily life, Divine Love accompanies the journey of a 42 year old woman who uses her position in a notary's office to advance her mission to save struggling couples from divorce. Whilst waiting for a Sign in recognition of her efforts, she is confronted with a crisis in her own marriage that ultimately brings her closer to God.
