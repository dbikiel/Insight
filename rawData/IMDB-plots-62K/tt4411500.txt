Dreaming of fame and fortune, a local Denver performer hires two indie filmmakers to come to town and make a film with him as the star.
Being in show business is tough, but being an actor in Denver is tougher, so when performer and full-time computer repairman, Arthur Martinez, hires two indie filmmakers to make a feature film with him as the lead, he realizes he's in over his head. "You guys have ruined my life," Arthur says one moment immediately following with, "This is the best film I'll ever be in." The filmmakers scrap the genre film Arthur had intended them to make - instead quickly designing an entirely new project based around his real-life persona, which becomes more and more elusive as the production steams ahead. Once Arthur realizes what the filmmakers are up to, his protective measure is to hide behind a mask, keeping the filmmakers questioning: are any of Arthur's moments on camera truthful or is it all just a performance in the end?
