In London, three otherwise law-abiding good men and their unscrupulous leader are about to commit a serious crime, but for different reasons.
Three good men - a broken boxer, an American veteran trying to win back his mother-dominated wife, and an Air Force Sergeant married to a faithless actress - are corrupted by Miles "Rave" Ravenscourt (Laurence Harvey), an amoral "gentleman". Because they need money, they let Miles lure them into his scheme to rob a postal van with a large cash cargo.
