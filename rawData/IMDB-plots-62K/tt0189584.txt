Two veteran salesmen dissect a sales pitch to a particular client, through their young protégé.
On the last evening of a convention two seen-it-all industrial lubricant salesmen and a youngster from the research department gather in the hotel's hospitality suite to host a delegates party. The main aim is to get the business of one particular big fish. When it becomes apparent that it is the lad who has developed a direct line to the guy, his strong religious beliefs bring him into sharp conflict with his older and more cynical colleagues.
Three sales representatives attend a trade show in the American Midwest to sell industrial lubricants. Larry Mann and Phil Cooper are two longtime friends, while young Bob Walker is a newcomer, lent by the company's R&amp;D team to help in the booth. The three hope to meet a business executive Larry refers to as 'the Big Kahuna, el Kahuna grande' in the hopes of landing an account. As their hotel stay proceeds, the gap in life experience between young Bob and his two colleagues grows ever more apparent. That gap threatens to become a chasm when the executive invites Bob, and only Bob, to meet with him.
