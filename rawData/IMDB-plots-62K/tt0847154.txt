In 2002, 12-year-old Maria, living in dire poverty with her family, is sold by her fisherman father to prostitute recruiter Seu Tadeu, who takes her to a low-class brothel in the Amazon region. While she suffers innumerable abuses, Maria only thinks of escaping the horrible conditions she's faced with.
Maria, a 12-year-old girl, is sold by her parents, believing she was going to work as a maid at some rich family's house. But the people who bought her have other plans: they'll force her to work at brothels all around Brazil, as many poor girls her age.
