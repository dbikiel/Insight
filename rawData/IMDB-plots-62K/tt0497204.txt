A documentary film crew arrive at a Latvian garbage dump to investigate reports of a giant mutated worm living in the garbage. When the worm story proves to be a myth, rather than waste their trip, they decide to film the dump itself. Far from being a lifeless wasteland, the dump proves to be home to a multitude of birds and animals and a handful of people, all struggling to survive in an endless cycle of death, decay and rebirth. Insects and snakes, beavers and deer, men and machines play out their roles against the backdrop of an expanse of gently steaming garbage which, thanks to deft camera work, at times seems surreally beautiful.
