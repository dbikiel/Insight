Lupin and Jigen face off with an assassin who has marked Jigen as his latest target.
Lupin and Jigen sneak into the country of East Doroa to steal its valuable treasure the Little Comet. The country has fortified its border after a singer named Queen Malta got assassinated in the neighboring country of West Doroa upon visit. Despite the civil war brewing between East and West Doroa, Lupin and Jigen still go ahead, but during the heist Jigen almost gets killed by a renowned sniper named Yael Okuzaki. It is said that Okuzaki prepares graves for his targets before executing his kills - and he has prepared a grave for Jigen.
