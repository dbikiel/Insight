A successful writer, home-schooled in his youth, masquerades as a student at a secondary school to experience all the fun and pranks he missed out on.
Hans Pfeiffer and some of his friends are drinking "Feuerzangenbowle". Talking about their school-time they discover that Hans never was at a regular school and so, as they think, missed an important part of his youth. They decide to send him back to school to do all the things he never could do before.
