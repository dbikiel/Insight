Now the descendants of that race - known as the 'Ghen' - control the planet Earth from advanced underground cities. An entire new universe has risen inside the remnants of our world known as Hollow Earth. Humans now work the surface in factories as slaves in the New World Order with pockets of resistance carrying on the fight. As rising Ghen Politician Crecilius Pryme takes power he urges his people to annihilate the remaining human population unleashing a shocking secret that will change the world forever.
