Two outlaws, Rio and Esqueda, raised together as stepbrothers, have a showdown over the issue of whether to evict new settlers from their territory.
Esqueda, an outlaw, attempts to force settlers King and Cordelia Cameron out of his territory. Esqueda's mother raised Rio as her own. Rio has loyalty to Esqueda but also feels the settlers should be able to stay. A showdown between the two raised as brothers is unavoidable.
It's the post-Civil War era in southwest Texas. Jos√© Esqueda is a bandito, who has among his men Rio, who does his job quietly and efficiently. Those in the area have no idea of Rio's background, including from where he came and what he did before arriving and becoming part of Esqueda's band of men. Esqueda resents anyone who he feels invades what he considers his rightful property in the grand sense, even those who acquire it by lawful means. As such, he is trying to run newly arrived King Cameron off the land, where Cam hoped to eke out a life as a rancher with his bride, Cordelia. With the sheriff feeling powerless to do anything against Esqueda - Esqueda killing him which would only have him replaced by another sole sheriff who would face the same predicament - a war ensues between Esqueda and Cam. Cam, in turn, also understands that killing Esqueda, if he is able, will not solve the problem with another bandit rising to take his place. Cam believes he stumbles onto an opportunity to co-opt Rio, willingly or unwilling, on his side which he hopes would only be the beginning of an uprising against the lawless bandits. Further complications ensue when deep emotions develop between Rio and Cordelia.
