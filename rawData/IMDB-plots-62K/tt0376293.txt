A trip to Africa is edited into a brief documentary without continuity between sound and image or story and time.
Kubelka was asked to do a documentation group of Europe's hunters in Africa, working on it for hours and do the editing very extreme so film live leaving only 12 1/2 minutes, Kubelka also did a revolution in sound synchronization in which he called the "sync events," and also done editing to create an illusion of continuity for a moment, one of the most important experiment film of all time.
