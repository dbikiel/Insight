An adult Martin Roy reminisces about his life in the 1966/67 school year. At fifteen years old and in his last year of junior high school, he breathed, ate and slept hockey. He collected hockey cards, played street hockey with his friends, tried skating and ice hockey for the first time in his life, but was most fascinated with his local national league team, the Montréal Canadiens, and its star player, Henri Richard. He dreamed of growing up and working for the Canadiens franchise. But a more immediate goal was to get tickets to one of their games, using M. Richard and his banker father, Hervé, as possible conduits to that goal. He also remembers his school life from that year, with the arrival of pot smoking free thinking hippie Ron Richardson as the new English teacher, and dreading home room with strict Mlle. Chouinard, who he eventually learned too had a human side. But he learned that there may be a couple of things more important than hockey: family, and the opposite sex.
