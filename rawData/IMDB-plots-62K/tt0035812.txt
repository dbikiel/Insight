Woody Woodpecker sneaks in to see the circus as an usher attempts to stop him. Both of them end up on the trapeze and the high wire.
Woody Woodpecker visits the circus. Singing "I Went to the Animal Fair," he strolls through a tiger's cage. As Woody looks at a rhinoceros, the nearby lion eats Woody's hot dog. Woody gets revenge by putting the lion's tail in the bun; the lion eats his own tail. Woody next tries to sneak into the main tent, and the run-ins with the guard take up the rest of the cartoon. First, the guard tells Woody he can work for his admission by watering an elephant, but he's not pleased when Woody ties the elephant's trunk to a hydrant. The chase is on, leading into the lion tamer's cage, onto the trapeze, and bicycling across the tightrope. Both Woody and the guard end up as targets in the shooting gallery.
Woody Woodpecker is enjoying himself at the circus, thanks partly to his reckless indifference to danger. He blithely walks through a tiger's cage, and steps out just as the tiger leaps for him and hits the bars of his cage instead. Later, a lion steals Woody's hot dog, and Woody is fearless enough to seek revenge. Woody's foolhardiness comes in handy when he wants to sneak into the main tent and see the show. A burly usher is determined to stop him; but circumstances conspire to put him and Woody high into the air, performing on the high wire and the trapeze. Woody scat sings during this new experience as the usher quakes in terror.
