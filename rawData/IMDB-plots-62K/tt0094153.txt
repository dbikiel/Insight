Three bumbling morons accidentally stumble into a cryogenic freezer and end up in the future, where monkeys populate the Earth.
Time of the Apes is a strung-together movie made from several episodes of a Japanese TV show. Big-hipped Catherine and her two charges, Johnny (who "doesn't care") and Caroline, are sent to some alternate time-line by being frozen in cryogenic tubes during an earthquake. They end up on a planet where apes rule humans but are ruled themselves by a supercomputer named "UECOM", which is a malevolent artificial being created by humans.
A scientist and two kids cryogenically freeze themselves. Several thousand years later, they are revived in a strange future where monkeys live as humans and where the only human left is Gono, some sort of hunter. With a vengeful monkey and the rest of the ape government on their tail, the gang must find a way to get home.
A woman takes her children to see their uncle, who is a scientist working on cryogenics experiments. They are using monkeys and other primates in their experiments. There is an earthquake, and the woman and her kids are trapped in cryogenic chambers and are somehow transported into a _Planet of the Apes_ type futures. They are captured, escape, return to the present and are eventually given an explanation of what happened to them that is incomprehensible. Also, this is really a re-edited Japanese TV series, so there's some odd continuity bits, especially near the end.
