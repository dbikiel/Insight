Traveling from France to Tangiers, a man looks to reunite with his former love, though their romance ended some 30 years earlier.
Connections and personality: France and Morocco, sisters, mothers and sons, husbands and lovers. Antoine arranges a job in Tangiers so he can reconnect to Cécile, his first love, unseen for 30 years. Sami, her son, comes from Paris with his friend Nadia and her son to see his mother and his Moroccan boyfriend. Nadia wants to see Aïcha, her twin, a devout Muslim unwilling to see her pill-popping sister. Antoine harbors romantic fantasies; Cécile lives in the real world of an empty marriage to Natan, a Jewish doctor who's broke, drinks too much, and wants to move back to Casablanca. Cécile is a follower. Dogs and mud present dangers, as does complaisance. Will the earth move?
