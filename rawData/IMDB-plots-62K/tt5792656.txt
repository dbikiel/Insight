The CEO of an international conglomerate sends two of his most regarded executives to investigate why shipments of cocaine are being hijacked and over cut somewhere on the supply chain.
A large batch of cocaine smuggled from Mexico to Canada through the United States is mysteriously lost along the way. The head of the drug cartel instructs his two assistants, Cook and Man, to figure out where and what exactly went wrong. Cook and Man must check the entire chain of international drug trafficking, crossing borders while trying to slip away from the feds.
