Based on a true story, the impossible love between a prison director and one of its female inmates.
Already incarcerated for four years, the rebellious teenager, Anna Amari, is transferred to a women's correctional facility, where right from the start, she will catch Jean Firmino's eye, the detention centre's director. But even though Jean is over twice Anna's age, in a seemingly good marriage, with a young daughter and a good job, his dangerous and powerful obsession for the sultry inmate will soon drag them both into an all-consuming and passionate love affair. Trapped behind the prison's thick walls, Jean will do everything to snatch a brief moment with the object of his desire, taking incrementally bigger risks despite gossip and consequences. Under those circumstances, is there a future in their reckless affair?
