The tragic life of a self-destructive female rock star who struggles to deal with the constant pressures of her career and the demands of her ruthless business manager.
Bette Midler plays The Rose, a female rock star strikingly similar to Janis Joplin. This movie follows Rose's career during her last tour, as she's determined to return to her Florida hometown. Although a success, she's exhausted and lonely, but continued working by her gruff and greedy manager. Though loud and brassy, Rose is an insecure alcoholic and former drug user who seems to crave approval in her life. She begins a romance with a limousine driver, who's actually an A.W.O.L. Sergeant from the United States Army. Her rock and roll lifestyle of sex, drugs, and rock and roll, and constant touring, lead her to an inevitable breakdown.
