Five teenagers violently escape a reformatory school in an Argentinean province. They must journey a hundred kilometers on foot, across the hills, for the promise of a home to continue their days. They hunt to feed, rob houses they come across, do drugs, bathe in the river, fight with each other and make love: A progressive voyage into the wilderness, that soon becomes a mystic fable about courage and grace.
