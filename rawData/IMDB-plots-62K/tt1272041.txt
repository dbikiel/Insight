Nine-year-old Karo grows up with her parents in an Amsterdam commune in the Seventies. She leads a carefree existence in this utopia-for-adults. Everything is shared in the squat, but not everyone is able to honor these ideals. Karo gets confused because of the internal conflicts that start to divide the group. Karo slowly realizes that nothing can stay the same forever.
Hardcore hippie Raven raises his daughter Karo in a mixed Dutch-Belgian squatters commune in 1970s southern Amsterdam, stealing by anti-capitalist principle. Karo's biological mother and her father's present lover share motherhood, while other couples and their kids all grow up together. Disputes about practicality versus revolutionary principles get out of hand, especially when confronted with outsiders, such as Karo's pseudo-siblings's bourgeois father.
