Gene and Frog, out to stop a bunch of cattle rustlers, assume the identities of what they believe to be dead bandits, which soon gets them in big trouble.
The ranch owned by Gene Autry (Gene Autry) and Buffalo Brady (Hal Taliaferro) has been hit by cattle rustlers. Gene and Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette) take off after the rustlers as does Brady and the ranch cowhands in a separate party. In a total comedy of errors compounded by coincidences, Gene and Frog come across the clothes of two notorious outlaws, Jed the Apache Kid (Max Hoffman Jr.) and Jim Black (Charles King), who have swapped clothes with two deputies they have killed. In what they thought was a good idea at the time, Gene and Frog don the clothes of the two outlaws. A sheriff's posse that is chasing Jed and Jim catches them and, based on the clothes they are wearing, conclude they have their men. But local rancher Joe Stafford (Monte Blue) , in reality the head of the rustling gang, gets them off. Gene and Frog end up at Stafford's hacienda where also in residence are his cook Ynez (Nina Campana), his niece Rosa Montero (Armida) and his step-daughter Mary Ellen (Ann Pendleton). And Jed and Jim show up, as does Brady and the singing cowhands (Al Clauser and His Oklahoma Outlaws.)
Chasing rustlers, Gene and Frog find that two of them have killed two deputies and changed clothes with them. Hoping to find the gang leader they change into the outlaw's clothes. This puts them on the right track when the big boss Stafford saves them from a posse. But the two outlaws now posing as Deputies arrive and Gene and Frog soon find themselves prisoners.
