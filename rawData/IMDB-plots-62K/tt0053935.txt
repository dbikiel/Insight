During World War II in North Africa, a medical field unit must cross the desert in their ambulance in order to reach the British lines in Alexandria.
A group of Army personnel and nurses attempt a dangerous and arduous trek across the desert of North Africa during World War II. The leader of the team dreams of his ice cold beer when he reaches Alexandria, but the problems just won't go away.
Transportation unit personnel and two nurses are compelled to try a journey across a part of the desert that is dangerous and also made more perilous by enemy unit actions. The idea is to reach Alexandria, where one of the rewards might be an ice cold lager. However, the journey, carried out in an ambulance of less-than-perfect state of maintenance and with the complications of a mysterious "hitchhiker" is really not just a drive down the block. With natural obstacles and the complications of a war situation, it becomes a hairy undertaking where all involved are tried to their limit.
North Africa, World War II. Four British medical staff, a medical unit C.O., the unit's Sergeant Major, and two female nurses, are separated from their unit while trying to evacuate from besieged Tobruk in an ambulance. Along the way, they pick up a South African infantry officer. With the Germans taking capturing most of their intended escape destinations, their options are few, and fraught with danger. Plus, the South African officer doesn't appear to be who he claims.
