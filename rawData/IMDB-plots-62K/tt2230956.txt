A couple realise their dream of retiring to the South of France. Their life changes dramatically when they meet another, younger couple.
Joseph and Brenda have done what many only dream of and retired to the South of France to live out the rest of their days as if they were permanently on holiday. But retirement is not what Joseph imagined, and when he meets a young, attractive woman, Suzanne, everything he thought he knew about himself and his world is turned upside down.
