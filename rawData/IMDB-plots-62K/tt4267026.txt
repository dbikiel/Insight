Five years after an unexplained malfunction causes the death of 15 tour-goers and staff on the opening night of a Halloween haunted house tour (Hell House), a documentary film crew visits the scene of the tragedy to investigate what really happened that night.
The tragedy of that horrible October back in 2009 during a Halloween haunted house tour is still surrounded in mystery. Sadly, what led to the death of fifteen people, both crew and customers alike who paid to experience original scares in a controlled environment, remains small town Abaddon's greatest secret. However, as both the locals and the authorities claim that the harrowing incident was a result of an unprecedented and unfortunate malfunction, in the meantime, a documentary crew determined to dig for answers in the derelict hotel where it all started, gathers testimonies, photographs and amateur video material; all fragments of an intricate, yet gruesome puzzle. Eventually, five years later, that night's sole survivor, Sara, will provide the documentarists with personal raw footage but is the crew prepared to witness the terror firsthand?
