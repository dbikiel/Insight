Shishio has set sail in his ironclad ship to bring down the Meiji government and return Japan to chaos, carrying Kaoru with him. In order to stop him in time, Kenshin trains with his old master to learn his final technique.
Kenshin wakes up to find himself at his master(Hiko Seijuro)'s house after getting washed by the waves to land while he was unconscious at sea for 3 days.

Meanwhile in Tokyo, Prime Minister Hirobumi Ito attends a meeting with Makoto Shishio who forces him to declare Kenshin a wanted outlaw and have him publicly executed or else Shishio will destroy both Tokyo and the government.
