Angel Express is a film about people restlessly seeking for the ultimate experience. Set in late nineties Berlin, it shows images of radical change: Young urban heroes in the glare of flashlights; an environment in which coldness and affection or lust for power and friendship go hand in hand. Types like the hooker Liv, or the top photographer Iris von Than with her cool and calculating manner and a tendency to go too far, zig-zag like pinballs through the neon jungle on an aimless search for their identity and social contact. There is the striking character of N.K. apparently a respectable businessman of slick and unscrupulous means and a gunrunner on the side who finally unveils himself as a corrupt policeman. And the hauntingly eccentric and insecure Patrick, Iris von Than's young business associate who constantly is in pursuit of something and whose motto is to survive by luxury. The protagonists, united by their common mood, feelings and attitude to life, are sucked into a deadly whirlpool of events.
