A CIA assassin attempts to break out of the contract killing business to try to lead a normal life. But when "the system" tracks her down and frames her for the death of her husband, she embarks on a path of revenge that leads her back into the life she tried to hard to abandon.
At dinner, Jane's husband collapses and dies, poisoned. She barely maintains consciousness as police and FBI arrive surrounding her house. She escapes and must try to find her would-be killers before they find her. Jane is a contract killer for the CIA with a non-official cover (a NOC). She quickly discovers discrepancies that lead her to believe she's a loose end in a rogue CIA operation. She heads for Trinidad, enlists the help of a tourist (at gunpoint), and enters a bank. Meanwhile, CIA operatives are on her trail, other government figures are involved, and a shadowy West Indian is following her too. Is there any way out?

Anthony Joseph, is partially filmed in Trinidad.The movie, which features young Swedish actress Frida Farrell in the role of Jane, takes viewers on a roller-coaster ride as Jane is on the run from the company she once worked for as she has evidence of them being involved in fraud.The company, knowing their secret is out, tries to frame Jane who ends up in the popular and prosperous caribbean island called Trinidad. They later hire Joseph, (who portrays Monoven) a highly-trained contract killer from the island, to eliminate her.
