A straight police detective is unnerved when ordered to go undercover with a gay police clerk, as a couple, to solve a series of murders in the gay community.
Sergeant Benson (Ryan O'Neal) is a Police detective. After a series of murders in the gay community he is ordered to go undercover with a gay Police clerk named Kerwin (Sir John Hurt) as his partner. In order to be noticed, they have to be flamboyant enough to attract attention, which Benson finds rather disturbing. Can an uptight heterosexual and a mousey homosexual form a meaningful relationship?
