A widower's daughter accidentally brings her doll to life while trying to cast a spell to resurrect her mother.
11-year-old Casey is despondent after her mother's death. As she and her father Ben drift apart, she finds a book of magic spells and tries to use one to bring her mother back to life. But the plan backfires and she finds that she's animated Eve, a fashion-plate dress-up doll. Eve is excited to be both alive and nearly six feet tall, but she has much to learn about living in the real world--and Casey doesn't think she has the desire or the patience to teach her.
