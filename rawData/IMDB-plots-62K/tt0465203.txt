Lucas and Clementine live peacefully in their isolated country house, but one night they wake up to strange noise... they're not alone... and a group of hooded assailants begin to terrorize them throughout the night.
Clémentine, a teacher in a French School in Bucharest, lives with her husband, Lucas, in a remote real estate in Snagov. During the night, Clémentine is woken by weird noises outside their house, and Lucas sees their car being stolen. The lights are turned off, the phones are disconnected and they see that they are no longer alone. When weird lights appear outside, they hide in the cellar and try to ask for help from what could be a dreadful night of pure terror...
Somewhere in Romania; Clementine is finishing her day of teaching the local kids French. On her way home she spots an abandoned vehicle beside the road. She continues on unaware of what happened to its occupants, a mother and her teenage daughter, the night before. Not that it matters, as tonight, along with her writer beau Lucas, she'll find out first hand. They're awakened during the night by strange phone calls and the TV downstairs being turned on--but this is only beginning of their night of terror as the phone lines go dead, the power goes out and their car goes missing, as they're stalked and set upon by THEM!
