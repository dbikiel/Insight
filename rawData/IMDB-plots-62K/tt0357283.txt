1979. A village in Pakistan. A widow sees her 17 years old son being attracted to Islamist militants. It brings her past back...
Set in 1979 Pakistan, General Zia-ul-Haq has imposed martial law and, within a few months, the country is decreed a Muslim state. Aicha, a well-adjusted woman in her forties, devotes her life to the education of her eighteen-year-old son Salim, in the little village of Charkhi, in the Pakistani Penjab. Salim is a quiet dreamer, but the fast moving political situation fills Aicha with anxiety, since her son is changing out of all recognition.
Widowed Ayesha Khan lives a poor lifestyle in Charkhi, Pakistan, along with her teen-aged son, Saleem. Their only income is her late husband's, Afsan, pension. She hopes to get Saleem a job near the Gurdwara, and then married to his sweetheart, Zubeida, the daughter of Amin and Shabnam. Then two bearded men, Rashid and Mazhar, arrive from Rawalpindi and attempt to impose Islamic law and awareness in Charkhi. Saleem gets involved, and shortly thereafter Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto is hung by Military General Zia-Ul-Haq. With reports of Russia attempting to attack Afghanistan, there is uncertainty and anger in Pakistan with militants calling for 'Jihad' against India and non-believers. To make matters worse, Sikh pilgrims are permitted to visit the local Gurdwara - including a Sikh stranger who attempts to meet with Ayesha.
