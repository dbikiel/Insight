During the exhibition of a Picasso Yellow-margin Triggerfish painting at a Parisian museum, the businessman and undercover Agent, Alejandro Felipe Salazar aka Picasso Trigger is assassinated. It seems that behind his murder is none other than Miguel Ortiz, a ruthless world-class crime lord with a grudge against the L.E.T.H.A.L. Agency, the one responsible for the death of his brother. Determined, Ortiz will stop at nothing to get his revenge, and before long, Agents Donna and Taryn will be on his target as he will attempt to eliminate them with a radio-controlled scale model plane loaded with explosives.
