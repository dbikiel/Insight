While in a nursing home visiting relatives, she meets Ninny Threadgoode, an outgoing old woman, who tells her the story of Idgie Threadgoode, a young woman in 1920's Alabama. Through Idgie's inspiring life, Evelyn learns to be more assertive and builds a lasting friendship of her own with Ninny.
Fried Green Tomatoes is a 1991 film directed by Jon Avnet. In this directorial bebut, Avnet cast four women to play the lead roles. Kathy Bates as Evelyn Couch, an unhappy housewife depressed with her life; Mary Stuart Masterson as Imogene Louise (Idgie) Threadgoode, the local tomboy who swears, smokes, drinks, gambles and never goes to church; Mary-Louise Parker as straight-laced Ruth Anne Jamison of Valdosta, Georgia. A preacher's daughter and only child in charge of the BYO activities and the young people at the church. And Idgie herself! And Jessica Tandy as Virginia (Ninny) Threadgoode, sister-in-law to Idgie. Idgie and Ruth lived back in the 1920's and 1930's in Whistle Stop, Alabama. Ninny did as well, and regales the two women's adventures to Evelyn, who takes these stories as inspiration for her own life. Fried Green Tomatoes is based off of the book "Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe" by Fannie Flagg. The book was released in 1987. In Britain, the movie has the exact same title as the book. Note: There are very few differences between book and movie for whom it may concern.
