Although the men object to her at first, she soon charms them all, especially the handsome young head of the company. Their romance gets sidetracked when she becomes involved in the Women's Suffrage movement.

At a time when respectable women did not work outside the home, Cynthia struggles for acceptance at a shipping company in Boston.
