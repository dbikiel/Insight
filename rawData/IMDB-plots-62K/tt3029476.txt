A group of men are trapped in a small pod on the sea bed, after diving down to fix an oil pipeline and becoming separated from their ship.
In the Somalia coast, the veteran divers Engel, Mitchell, Hurst and the rookie Jones are assigned to repair an oil pipeline on the bottom of the sea by the Vaxxilon representative Karsen. They are advised that a storm is coming, but the Diving Support Vessel Lorimer lowers the bell with the team. They succeed to weld the pipeline but the storm comes and the vessel sinks, killing the whole crew. Short of the oxygen, the divers try to communicate with the surface and the leader Mitchell keeps the hope that they will be saved. But will the oil company send another vessel to rescue them?
