Poor Milton can't get any respect. He works at an evil corporation called Initech and his "office" has been shoved into the basement. He talks to the camera, picks his nose, and threatens to burn the building down. Occasionally, his boss Bill Lumbergh comes in to further complicate Milton's life. Animated short that the film "Office Space" (1999) is based on.
