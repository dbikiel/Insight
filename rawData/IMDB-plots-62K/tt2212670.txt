When a woman is wrongly accused of the death of her ex-husband, she sets out to solve the murder mystery and find the real killer before the day of the funeral, when she is to be taken into custody.
On the night of their thirtieth wedding anniversary celebration, Michael Brandon, who owns and runs a research firm, tells his wife, Audrey Brandon, that he wants to leave her for another woman, his colleague Christine Boll. This news comes as a shock to Audrey, who never thought there was a problem in their marriage let alone infidelity. Several months later on the eve of their divorce being finalized with Michael long having moved out, Audrey finds Michael stabbed to death in her kitchen. Audrey becomes the police's chief suspect, they having enough evidence to charge her with his murder, which they plan to do following Michael's funeral. As such, Audrey, donning a disguise, decides to go on the run so that she can discover who really killed Michael. Although Michael was generally an up front kind of man, Audrey knows there are others out there who may have had motive, such as Christine, and Michael's former business partner, Artie Green. Beyond those with motive, Audrey also has to decide who she can and cannot trust to help her. Among those in the category that she would trust with her life are her and Michael's son, Alex Brandon, and her two best friends, neighbors Anita Dixie and Phyllis Dietrichson, which may be contrary to their respective husbands, Ted Dixie and Carter Dietrichson, who were friends with Michael. The one person she wants to trust is her college boyfriend, now married David Larabee, who had business dealings with Michael, whose wife Joan Larabee was a close, personal friend of Michael's, and who Audrey admits to herself is the one person who she would have even remotely considered cheating with herself if the opportunity ever arose.
