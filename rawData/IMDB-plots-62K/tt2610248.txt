An ill Dutch woman visits her family in Norway in hopes of reconnecting with her estranged mother.
'Disappearance' takes place in the remote winter landscape of Norway. The Dutch photographer Roos travels to a snow-covered corner in Norway to visit her mother and half-brother. Last time she left with a fight. This visit also promises to be dramatic, because she has something to say; she is suffering from an incurable disease, but it seems difficult to start a sensitive conversation with her mother. Old pain and numerous reproaches keep her from sharing anything with her mother. Aided by her half brother and her old flame, the two women reconcile and she is able to make her next and inescapable step. She refuses to use medication and eventually she faces the self-chosen death.
