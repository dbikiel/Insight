Tomorrow is an important day for Amir. He had participated in an international architecture competition to win the competition with foreign companies. His wife ,Tahereh (Hengameh Ghaziani), followed him to make their home in a quiet environment, but ...
The film depicts a day in the life of Tahereh who is a devoted housewife, a helpful neighbor and an attentive person. Tahereh feels that she is unnoticed by everybody especially by her own family . This is a film about the inner emotions of a simple Iranian woman.
'As Simple as That' is the touching portrait of an under-appreciated and unfulfilled woman's loneliness. Tahereh goes about her day, quietly attending to the demands of family and neighbors while her own low spirits go unnoticed. As her sense of isolation becomes more profound, even the brief glimpses of happiness she catches through her children seem to mark her search for meaning in her own life. The film captures Tahereh's emotional state with an understated finesse. Celebrated at multiple film festivals across the world, this is a film of great poignancy and beauty.
