A collector comes into possession of the skull of the Marquis de Sade and learns it is possessed by an evil spirit.
A collector of esoterica, Dr. Maitland, buys an unusual skull from his ordinary source of artifacts. The skull is what remains of marquis De Sade. Much too soon he discovers how the skull affects him: by turning him into a frenzied killer.
Dr. Maitland knows Anthony Marco is as disreputable as they come. Certainly his wife dislikes the man coming to the house at late hours. But Dr. Maitland finds that Marco is indispensable when it comes to finding the kind of morbid curios he requires for his research. One night, Marco arrives with something quite special: a book bound in human skin. It was the creation of the notorious sadist, the Marquis de Sade. But Marco means the book only to whet the curious doctor's appetite. The next night he brings de Sade's own skull. The trouble is, the skull is reputed to be possessed by a spirit, which in turn possesses the minds of those who own it. The skull's former owner, Sir Matthew Phillips, is certainly glad to be rid of it. Dr. Maitland tries to dismiss the stories about the skull, but then come the nightmares. And then his nightmares become real.
