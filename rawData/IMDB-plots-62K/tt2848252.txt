After a programmer working on a top secret surveillance program snaps in a murderous rage, a notorious code wizard with problems of his own moves into the startup offices to figure out what went wrong and deliver the final product. But the deeper he delves into the code, the more the code takes on a malevolent life of its own.
Nightmare Code is an independent sci-fi thriller about computerized behavior recognition, behavior modification and 24/7 surveillance. It takes place in a troubled start-up where a young programmer with a troubled past of his own is brought in to finish the company's product on a tight deadline, in the wake of the murderous rampage and suicide of the previous programmer. The deeper he probes into the code, the more his own behavior changes as the code takes on a life of it's own. Utilizing surveillance camera, PC cam, videochat and eyeglasscam, for more than half the movie the viewer watches four images at once, but often out-of sync as if someone - perhaps the software program itself - is telling the story.
