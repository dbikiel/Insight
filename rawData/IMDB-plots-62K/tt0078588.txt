Follow James Burke through the history of science and technology in this collection of 10 1-hour episodes, starting with "The Trigger Effect."
This series explores the various paths of how technological change happens and the social effects of these changes on Western society. To illustrate this, James Burke follows various timelines of how one innovation lead to something seemingly totally unrelated in the future such as how a 17th century Dutch cargo ship design lead to development of plastic in the 20th century.
