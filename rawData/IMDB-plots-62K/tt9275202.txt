The story of New York City journalists Jimmy Breslin and Pete Hamill lauded in their time as the voice of New York.
Two men defined newspaper reporting in late 20th century New York. They understood the streets, the people and events that shape their lives. Jimmy Breslin and Pete Hamill mark the end of a tradition, city reporters telling the story of their city while presiding over the death of their trade. They were more than writers. This film is a history of their work and their lives told in their words because no one else is qualified to tell the tale.
