A young girl named Mitsuki receives a ticket for a bus tour from her uncle. The tour appears to be normal (expect that everyone appears to be quite somber) but Mitsuki learns its true purpose. All passengers and the tour manager have a suicide pact to send the bus over a cliff so the families can collect the insurance money.
