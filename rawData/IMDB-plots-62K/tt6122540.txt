A camera crew follows two "undecided" voters along the actual campaign trail, and no Presidential candidate - on either side of the aisle - is spared.
The 2016 Presidential campaign just got even crazier. In this unprecedented comedy, a camera crew follows two "undecided" voters along the actual campaign trail, and no Presidential candidate - on either side of the aisle - is spared. But when the producers of their show conspire to drive the undecideds apart, they have to band together or risk becoming pawns in a sinister plot that could change the course of the election. Using actual footage from real-world interactions with all the major Presidential candidates - including Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush (and many more!) - "Undecided" gives the 2016 election the unforgettable comedy it so richly deserves.
