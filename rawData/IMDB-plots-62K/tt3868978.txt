John Whitmore wakes to find his wife, Anne, disappeared from their bed overnight and a recorded ransom message now remains in her place.
John Whitmore wakes one morning to find himself in the midst of a real-life nightmare. His wife, Anne, disappeared from their bed during the night and a recorded ransom message now remains in her place. This mysterious recording instructs Whitmore to contact a man named David, who will escort John and his life savings to a cabin deep within the woods, where he will be reunited with his wife. He does as directed, but not before calling a life-long friend for help. David forces the men into a rusted RV and the three hit the road. John attempts to calm himself by piecing together the events of the previous evening, but instead he finds himself questioning David's motivation and, eventually, the entire situation. It becomes obvious he will need to take a stand to save his wife...and, quite possibly, himself. Told through fragments of the past that shatter the present, "Dusk" explores the darkest recesses of the mind through a night of chaos, deceit and paranoia.
