In a future postapocalyptic America ruled by a fascist televangelist, young thief Joe and his brother agree to help pretty Mila and her sister find an ancient artifact that could change everything.
The year is 2099. The United States is ruled by the Reverend Jimmy Joe II, in a dictatorship where big guns and fundamentalist religion are used to keep the masses in control. The Reverend's troopers patrol the streets and the slums with assault rifles, ready to prevent any trouble from the revolutionary Kropfelders. Joe Gage and his brother Artie are petty criminals, involved in illegal vitamin trading and smuggling refugees into Mexico. Their business takes a downturn during Joe's stay in prison, and they find themselves without gainful employment. During an altercation in a flophouse, they meet up with Mila and Blaise Hart - two antique hunters who are looking for muscle to protect them while they do a little freelance archeology. With the promise of valuable memorabilia from the Twentieth Century, the Gages go with the two sisters as they follow their treasure map. But they cannot avoid attention from the Reverend's troopers - and after a while, Joe begins to suspect that there is more to the sisters' hunt than they have been told...
