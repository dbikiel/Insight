Dr Calgary returns home from an expedition and goes looking for a hitchhiker whom he gave a lift to two years previously in order to return the man's address book. He discovers the man has been executed for his mother's murder.
Paleontologist Dr. Arthur Calgary visits the Argyle family to give them an address book that belongs to Jack Argyle. But he is told that Jack has been executed for the murder of his wife. But the address book can prove that Jack was innocent, so Dr. Calgary starts the investigation all over.
