The story of three close friends who are involved in a love-triangle.
In a story interspersed with interview tales of romantic pitfalls, friendship turns to romantic rivalry for gay man Francis and straight woman Marie when a veritable Adonis named Nicolas enters their lives. Sexual tensions mount as Francis and Marie await Nicolas' show of preference.
Two best friends--the straight retro-chic young woman, Marie, and her equally fashionable gay companion, Francis--find themselves entangled in a silently bitter romantic rivalry, when the curly-haired Apollo, Nicolas, enters their lives. Utterly infatuated, both fashionistas will compete against each other for the blonde narcissus' attention; however, no one seems able to decipher Nicolas' intentions. But, before a tantalisingly impossible love triangle, can there be winners?
