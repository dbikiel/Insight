On the eve of his wedding, a successful writer travels across the country to meet up with ex-lovers in an attempt to make amends for past relationship transgressions.
Based on his play by the same name, Neil LaBute's script follows a nameless and successful but misanthropic and narcissistic writer who, on the eve of his wedding, travels across the country to meet up with ex-lovers in an attempt to make amends for past relationship transgressions. Crisscrossing from Seattle to Boston, he reunites with high school sweetheart Sam in Seattle, sexually free-spirited Tyler in Chicago, married English college professor Lindsay in Boston, his best friend's little sister Reggie in Seattle, and "the one that got away" Bobbi in Los Angeles. A modern-day Candide stumbling through a landscape familiar to most men-messy breakups.
A humorous retelling of lost love through the eyes of not the heartbroken, but the heart breaker. Following a young, successful writer on his journey to find out, once and for all if he had indeed instilled a sense of lasting devotion, in any of the ex girlfriends he felt had most definitely instilled their own unforgettable impressions upon his own heart in an attempt to find a little clarity and maybe something worth writing about.
