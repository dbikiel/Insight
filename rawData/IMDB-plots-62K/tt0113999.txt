When a man's wife and family are murdered, he plots revenge only to find out that the killer is under Federal protection and he must exact his own form of justice.
Cool wacko cop, Karl Savak wants to steal and sell prototype military weapons. But, while he was stealing ammo, one of his comrades kills the family of John North. He is a military combat expert, who soon after starts his own investigation. But, it's not easy to take down one of most decorated FBI officers.
Master Sergeant John North is a Solider who has a wife named Darlene and a daughter named Marianne. When Darlene and Marianne are killed in a hostage situation following an arms deal, John walks into the situation and gets shot. John lapses into a coma, and wakes up after 8 weeks. After recovering, John is furious to discover that corrupt FBI agent Karl Savak has enrolled his henchman Marcus, who is the killer, in a witness protection program. John turns vigilante and stumbles upon a conspiracy that involves Marcus, drug kingpin Dexter Kane, and a stolen-military-weapons mastermind, who turns out to be Savak. Meanwhile, ghetto kid Mikey prepares to avenge the murder of a schoolmate. Since North knows Mikey's mother, he befriends Mikey while using Mikey to infiltrate the city's drug couriers in hopes of taking down Marcus and Savak.
