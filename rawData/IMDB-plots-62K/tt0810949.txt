Four characters living in one neighborhood in London - all living dramatically different lives, all of them on the edge - see their stories unfold.
London banker Mark has just made a fortune in a financial deal. Feeling stifled by his pregnant wife's material expectations and guilty after facing some abused homeless, he becomes a shelter benefactor. Trying his hand as volunteer, he takes a personal interest in runaway teenager Zoe, whose expectations prove even worse. Also in the shelter is recently released violent repeat-offender Robert. He takes a romantic interest in runway pregnant Michelle and her preteen daughter Danielle, while looking for his mother Margaret, who forbade him to see his beloved late dad. Mark's noble intentions lead to unexpected dramas.
