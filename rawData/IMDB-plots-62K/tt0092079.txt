A wealthy yet depressed architect and his sympathetic wife strive to conquer their life issues in anticipation of Harvey's 60th birthday party.
Harvey and Gillian Fairchild face a very difficult weekend. Harvey, celebrating his 60th birthday, is stressed and depressed. Gillian is awaiting the results of a throat biopsy. Their lives are further complicated by their three grown children, a ditsy neighbor, a fortune teller, and an alcoholic priest.
Married Harvey and Gillian Fairchild, an architect and singer respectively, have a busy upcoming weekend in celebrating Harvey's sixtieth birthday, first with their three adult offspring - Josh, Megan and Katie - and each's significant other descending on the family ocean-side Malibu estate for a Saturday night family dinner, with Katie and her boyfriend Steve flying in from New York, topped by a Sunday afternoon leading into night garden party with all their friends at the estate as the primary fÃªte. In not wanting to take away from the weekend festivities, Gillian is not going to tell Harvey or the rest of the family that she has just gone in for a biopsy for a lesion in her throat which may or may not be cancerous, the expedited test results available on Monday. Gillian's stoicism over her real health scare is tested by Harvey who has been going through not only some work issues with difficult client Janice Kern, but an end of work life moving into senior age emotional crisis, at times his behavior bordering on a nervous breakdown in dealing with that crisis. What Harvey does this weekend is affected by Janice's latest unreasonable requests, running into an old Notre Dame college rival and former roommate now Catholic priest Tony Baragone, and consulting Madame Carrie, a fortune teller who has set up shop in Malibu. These problems at the Fairchild estate are only exacerbated by the arrival of the three offspring and Gillian needing to deal with their respective issues.
