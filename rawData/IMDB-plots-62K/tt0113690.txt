During a routine case in L.A., NY private investigator Harry D'Amour stumbles over members of a fanatic cult, who are waiting for the resurrection of their leader Nix. 13 years ago, Nix was gunned down by his best trainee Swann. In the meantime Swann is advanced to a popular illusionist like David Copperfield and is married to the charming Dorothea. She hires D'Amour to protect Swann against the evil cult members. A short time later Swann is killed by one of his own tricks and the occurrences are turning over, and it crackles between Dorothea and D'Amour.
As a twelve-year-old hostage, Dorothea assists in the brutal murder of her captor, Nix, an evil cult leader with supernatural powers, by his former protege, Philip Swann. Thirteen years later, she seeks the assistance of a detective specializing in the occult when former cult members associated with Swann, now a prominent illusionist, are threatened by Nix's most loyal and sadistic disciple.
