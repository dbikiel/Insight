Old Hui runs a restaurant specializing in roast duck. His secret duck recipe is very tasty, but customers and staff alike have to put up with the filthy shop and Hui's cost-cutting way of doing business. When ''Danny Fried Chicken'' (an American-style fast-food restuarant) opens up across the street, Hui receives a rude shock and is forced to lift his game to compete. He might even have to supply clean chopsticks.
