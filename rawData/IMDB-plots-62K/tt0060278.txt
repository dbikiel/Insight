The Daleks' fiendish plot in 2150 against Earth and its people is foiled when Dr. Who and friends arrive from the 20th century and figure it out.
Based on a story from the BBC TV serial "Doctor Who". Dr. Who and his companions arrive on Earth in the year 2150 AD, only to discover that the planet has been invaded and its population enslaved by the dreaded Daleks. The time travellers assist human resistance groups to foil the Daleks' plan to mine the Earth's core.
Policeman Tom Campbell stumbles into the TARDIS on a normal day and ends up being taken to 2150 A.D, by Dr. Who. The future seems to be deserted, but the group soon finds out that the world is currently being controlled by the evil DALEKS. Those who have still survived are in hiding, to prevent them from being turned into Robomen. Dr. Who teams up with the survivors in order to take down the Daleks.
When there is a heist of a shop, policeman Tom Campbell runs to a police station that is indeed the TARDIS. He encounters Dr. Who, his niece Louise and his granddaughter Susan that are departing to the year 2150. They find London completely destroyed and discover that the Daleks have invaded Earth. There is a resistance movement but most of the survivors have turned into soldiers called Robomen or have been forced to work in a mine for the Daleks. What will happen to the travelers?
