Two pairs, each married for quite a long time, are living in a small east German town. The film focuses on the relationships between each of the four people and what happens when an affair takes place between two of them who are not married to each other and logically betraying the two remaining characters. This event leads to deep thoughts about marriage, friendship, relationships and last not least life itself.
Chris, a radio DJ, and his wife, Katrin, who works at a truck stop, are friends with Uwe, who owns a snack bar, and his wife, Ellen, who sells perfume. Chris initiates an affair with Ellen; Katrin walks in on them while they are bathing together. Each of the principals has a radically different way of dealing with it. Meanwhile, Chris's radio horoscopes seem oddly personal, and the street musicians outside Uwe's restaurant keep getting more numerous.
