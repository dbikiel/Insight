A terrifying tale of survival in the mangrove swamps of Northern Australia
While on vacation on Northern Australia, Gracie, her husband Adam and her younger sister Lee decide to take the Blackwater Barry tour in the swamp for fishing. Their guide Jim uses a small motor boat and takes the tourist along the river to a remote spot. When they stop, they are attacked by a huge crocodile that capsizes their boat and immediately kills Jim. The three survivors climb a tree and when they realize that help would never come to rescue them, they decide to try to find a way out of their sheltered location. However, in the muddy water, their boat is flipped and the crocodile stalks the trio under the water.
Based on a true story, Black Water is a thriller thats sounds a now familiar warning that Australia can be dangerous place for a holiday.Its DNA goes back to the taut, tight thrills of Spielberg s Duel, then traces a line through the classics of Jaws and Alien, past the guerrilla film making of Robert Rodriguez and mutates into the same gene pool as quasi-real horrorsurvival such as the Blair Witch Project and Open Water Black Water is based in realism. It stalks the line between horror and psychological thriller, a tale or true survival, that begs the question what would you do? How would you get out alive?
