Jonathan leaves the office everyday at noon. When he gets home, he goes to sleep. Every morning he wakes up and there is a breakfast prepared for him along with a video telling him about the second part of his day.
Jonathan and John are brothers, yet they share the same body. Life was routine for both of them; Jonathan gets the first half of the day (7:00 AM to 7:00 PM) and John gets the other half (7:00 PM to 7:00 AM). Everything starts to shift when Jonathan realizes that John has a girlfriend and now wants so much more than this shared life.
