A dog leads its master to his kidnapped baby.
Rescued by Rover is a film about a dog. Not only is it a film about a dog it is also a film about the kidnaping of a young baby by an old woman. With these two classical Hollywood ingredients and some stunning dialogue, (It's silent!), Rescued by Rover really hits a nerve. The repeated shots provide some interest in what, surprisingly, is an entertaining example of early cinema, canine heroics and a man wearing mascara.
An elderly woman approaches a young woman walking with her son in the stroller. The young woman ignores her and, in revenge, the old woman, when the other is distracted, kidnaps her son. The dog sniffs where the child has been brought and accompanies the master there.
