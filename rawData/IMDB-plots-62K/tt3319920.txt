Based on her handwritten letter of unsubstantiated statements, the prime suspect and Angela's father, John, confesses to the hideous crime, even though he has no recollection of his action. With the aid of the expert British psychiatrist, Professor Kenneth Raines, Kenner starts to delve deeper and deeper into the foggy landscape of fluid memories, as the doctor's regressive therapy unearths terrifying traces of occultism. Will John remember what truly happened? Is Bruce the next victim?
