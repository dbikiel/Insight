A documentary about the myth of clean coal. The film reveals the true, hidden environmental and social costs of the 'cheap' nineteenth century technology that still provides more than half the electricity powering today's digital age. DIRTY BUSINESS exposes Big Coal's propaganda campaign to convince the public that renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, are not ready for prime time - and that clean coal already exists.
