Yazi Tura (Toss Up) is the film of two stories taking place in 1999. Stories of two young men... One is "Ridvan the Devil", a young football player from Central Anatolia, Cappadocia / Goreme, and the "Cevher the Ghost", a young man who is living with his father in Istanbul. Both went to the army together, and fought in the Eastern Anatolia. Both had dreams and expectations for their civil lives back home. After their military service Ridvan goes back to his village with his right leg missing, the leg that he would score goals with, due to a mine explotion. Neither his fianc√©e nor his friends treat him the way before. What Ridvan has been through during the war actually brings him down with time. In the same mine explosion Cevher also lost his hearing ability of his right ear, but he is going to go through a greater change after he rescues his father from the wreckage of the Marmara Earthquake.
Toss-Up sets up in two locations: a Central-Eastern Anatolian town where veteran "Seytan Ridvan," named after the great soccer star, resides and Istanbul, where veteran "Hayalet Cevher" does. The first half of the film tells the story of Ridvan (Olgun Simsek), who feels alienated upon arriving home from military service to find out that people don't value his doings in the military and his wife-to-be is distancing herself from him. The second half of the film tells the story of Cevher who has turned into a sort of a brigand, a mob member whose only dream is to open up a buffet but who is also shook up with the experience of military service and the earthquake on August, 17.
