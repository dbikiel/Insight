In the European village of Gudenberg in 1890, Prof. Mayer and his assistant Isabel have created a powerful ray machine. One of the powerful rays is shot into space and attracts a flying saucer. The alien pilot decides that the ray poses too great a threat to the universe and must be destroyed. Sex murderer Thomas is possessed by an alien intelligence and infiltrates Mayer's household; Mayer himself is later taken over by an alien mind. Paul Rosten, a young scientist who is in love with Mayer's niece Laura, arrives. The alien "Mayer" and "Thomas" rig the ray gun to explode, killing all who know its secret. Thomas kills Isabel, but before he can murder Laura, Mayer throws off the alien intelligence and she is saved. Mayer realizes that the ray is too powerful for human use, and he destroys it. The flying saucer departs.
In the late 1800's, Boris Karloff has discovered a way to use nuclear power. He creates a beam weapon and blows up a big rock. Outer space aliens are scared and one alien who looks a lot like James Cameron with a big fake nose only this one isn't fake lands and brings other aliens who take over the bodies of Karloff and his assistant. The assistant is a Jack the Ripper style killer who has done a few nasty murders which have riled the townsfolk. The body-snatched bodies become radioactive and start killing flowers and other stuff (but don't die themselves) and some stuff happens and in the end Karloff destroys the beam weapon equipment (and his lab and house), then the aliens leave and warn us that if anyone ever does it again there will be trouble.
