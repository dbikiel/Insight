Pressured by his deceased mother's ghost to return home to the family he abandoned, a former addict grabs a bag of pills and a sack of marijuana and hits the road to Louisiana.
Years ago, Scott left common lover Katherine at the altar to become a hedonistic junkie. She married his brother William, a successful Louisiana workaholic, who sired a daughter but probably not bright nerd son Charles and is serially adulterous on his many business trips. Now Scott returns on horseback, having lost his drivers permit, inviting himself and proving a popular, yet unreliable uncle for Charles. Making up with father is impossible due to Alzheimer. As Scott keeps surprising his family, his sad secret emerges.
