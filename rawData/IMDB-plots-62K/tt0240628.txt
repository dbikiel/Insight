A biopic about the actor James Dean, whose stardom of the ultimate teenage rebel as well as the premature death made him a legend. His roles are depicted having much in common with his personal life, most notably the difficult relationship with his father.
Starting with his childhood in Santa Monica, this biopic explores the tumultuous life and early death of James Dean. Dean makes his Hollywood debut in Elia Kazan's "East of Eden (1955)," opening the floodgates for his film career. While enjoying his newfound success, Dean embarks on a relationship with Italian actress Pier Angeli. His success, however, is overshadowed by his father's reluctance to bridge a painfully deep gap with him.
