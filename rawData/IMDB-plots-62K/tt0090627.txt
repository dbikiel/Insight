An epic from the dark ages about the legendary lost tribe of warrior women. The girls fly into danger, come up against fierce tribes, fall prey to sorcery, put to rest a family rivalry of centuries past and battle to victory.
Lost for centuries, the legendary Sword of Azundati--a magnificent blade imbued with an unlimited magical power--is the only thing on Earth that can defeat the dark necromancer, Kalungo, and his demonic minions. After surviving a devastating attack on the emerald city of Imbissi, the untamed Amazon warrior, Queen Dyala, embarks on a peril-laden quest to retrieve the mystical artefact, along with the equally fearless sisters-in-arms, Tashi and Tashinge. However, treachery, sorcery, and betrayal stand in their way. Will Dyala, the dauntless Amazonian defender, thwart the evil sorcerer's plans for world domination?
