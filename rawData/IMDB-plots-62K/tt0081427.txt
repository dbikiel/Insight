Gaetano, a young Neapolitan, decides to leave home, work and friends, to look for other moments of life and meet other people. He goes to Florence, to his aunt's home. In a clinic, where he goes by chance, he meets Martha and falls in love with her. After a series of funny situations (an old friend from the relentless chatter coming from Naples and the mature aunt and her elderly lover, a young American priest who wants to involve him in his visits to evangelical force, the encounter with Riccardino, a young man frustrated by an oppressive mother and the father waiting for the miracle of re-growth of an amputated hand, etc.) Gaetano decides to stay in Florence and to act as father to Martha's incoming son, even if the girl does not want to disclose the exact name of the father .
