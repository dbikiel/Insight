The 'Two Tymes', Joe and June, need to change up their dogeared vaudeville act - fast. Cue their son Buster; a cocky hoofer who bolts from boarding school and joins them, propelling the trio into the big time. But success brings trouble.
A married couple who have a song-and-dance act in vaudeville are in trouble. Their struggling act is going nowhere, they're almost broke and they have to do something to get them back on top or they'll really be in trouble. They decide to put their young son in the act in hopes of attracting some new attention. The boy turns out to be a major talent, audiences love him and the act is on its way to the top. That's when an organization whose purpose is to stop children from performing on stage shows up, and they're dead set on breaking up the act.
