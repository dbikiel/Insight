Kir returns home from the war in Chechnya, missing a leg, but still alive. Kir had enlisted to earn enough money to marry Tatyana. But, now that he has returned, he feels distant from her, and all that he had known. Kir is still haunted by his experiences in Chechnya, and the tragic deaths there of his two friends, fellow soldiers Nikich and Igor. Unable to adjust to civilian life, Kir begins to get into trouble. He impulsively commits a robbery, then a more horrible crime. After a traffic accident on a lonely stretch of road, the ghosts of his two fallen comrades begin to appear to him. Can Nikich and Igor reach out from the grave to help their friend Kir come to terms with his past and find forgiveness in his heart for himself and others?
