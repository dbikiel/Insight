In World War II, the island of Malta, strategically located and vital to supply lines in the Mediterranean Sea, is fiercely attacked by the Germans, but staunchly defended by the British.
In 1942, Britain was clinging to the island of Malta since it was critical to keeping Allied supply lines open. The Axis also wanted it for their own supply lines. Plenty of realistic reenactments and archival combat footage as the British are beseiged and try to fight off the Luftwaffe. Against this background, a Royal Air Force reconnaissance photographer's romance with a local girl is endangered as he tries to plot enemy movements.
On Malta while in transit to Cairo, Flight Lieutenant Peter Ross, an aerial reconnaissance specialist, finds himself assigned to duty on the beleaguered island. Located only fifty-seven miles from the coast of Sicily, Malta was a key Naval and Air base during World War II. During one of the frequent air raids, he meets a local girl and wants to marry her. Life is precarious however and the local population in particular suffered severe hardships. Apart from the daily bombings, they faced severe food shortages with only limited access to the island by Allied convoys. In 1942, King George VI awarded the island the George Cross, the civilian equivalent of the Victoria Cross.
