On Christmas Eve, Shannon McManus (Andrea Roth) is stuck driving around a wealthy and eccentric client (Howard Hesseman) who is giving away large sums of money with the secret hope of reuniting with his long lost daughter.
It's Christmas Eve, and divorced Shannon McManus-Johnson is having troubles making it a Merry Christmas for her adolescent son, Trevor McManus-Johnson, due to their tight financial situation since the divorce. While working as a driver for a limousine service, Shannon is working toward getting licensed as a CPA to make a better life for her and Trevor. In what is already a difficult enough situation in making it a Merry Christmas for Trevor, Shannon is forced to work on Christmas Eve, she driving for wealthy businessman Fred Nickells. What Shannon is initially unaware of is that Fred, who has never met her, specifically requested her to be his driver due to a shared history about which Shannon is further unaware. On this day, Fred seems determined to make it a Merry Christmas for anyone he encounters by spreading his wealth freely to others. Into their midst comes television reporter Peter Archer, who hears about Fred's actions and thus who wants to get an exclusive as to Fred's story. Partly from Peter's intervention, Fred and thus Shannon's story slowly comes to light in bits and pieces, and which may include Fred actually being crazy. Peter has to decide how much he will actually put on their air, especially if what he discovers is potentially explosive or sensationalistic in nature, as in competing priorities he feels he needs that one big story to secure his promotion to the national bureau in Washington DC, he one of two in the running, while he slowly starts to fall for Shannon who he may not want to hurt by making any of the information public.
