Sid, Eddie and Crash get in trouble with Santa and have to get their names off of the naughty list.
When Sid accidentally destroys Manny's heirloom Christmas rock and ends up on Santa's naughty list, he leads a hilarious quest to the North Pole to make things right and ends up making things much worse. Now it's up to Manny and his prehistoric posse to band together and save Christmas for the entire world.
Of all the Christmases, the usually careless but well-meaning primaeval sloth, Sid, picked this particular one to ruin entirely, now that Manny's young daughter, Peaches, has grown up. With the family's precious heirloom smashed into pieces and a place in Santa's long list of naughty kids rightfully earned, Sid along with Crash, Eddie, and Peaches set out on a journey all the way up to the frozen North Pole, to make things right again; however, Sid is bound to do more harm than good. Will Manny and his team pull off a real miracle to save Christmas?
