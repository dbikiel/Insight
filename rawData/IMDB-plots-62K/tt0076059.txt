When an upwardly mobile couple find themselves unemployed and in debt, they turn to armed robbery in desperation.
Manager Dick Harper and his attractive young wife Jane are used to a comfortable lifestyle. They just build a swimming-pool when Dick is fired very unexpectedly - leaving him with $70,000 debt on the house. They try to hide this from the neighbors and just cut down their expenses, but soon it's obvious: living from unemployment bonus drives them crazy, it's uncertain if they can keep the house. Dick doesn't see another way out than robbing drug stores - but this takes more skill than expected! Only as a team Dick and Jane can succeed.
When the executive engineer Dick Harper is unexpectedly fired by the president Charlie Blanchard of the Taft Aerospace, company where he works, his wife Jane Harper and him get completely broken, full of debts including the mortgage of their house and without means to support their lifestyle. Dick unsuccessfully tries to find a new position, while Jane looks for a job and cuts their costs to the minimum. While using the insufficient unemployment paycheck of the social security to survive, they contract a loan in a bank. There is a heist in the bank and Jane accidentally steals some money from the thieves, and the couple decides to steal to survive and maintain their social status.
