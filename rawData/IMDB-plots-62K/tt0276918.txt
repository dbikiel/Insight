At the Winter Olympics of 1980, after two tense weeks amidst growing Cold War fears, the U.S. Olympic hockey team found themselves playing improbably against the legendary unbeatable Soviet Army hockey team for a chance at Olympic Gold. From the live footage taken at Lake Placid, NY, and through interviews beginning with the team's assembly through the experience of winning the gold medal, we meet the young hockey legends Jim Craig, Mike Eruzione, Jack O'Callahan, Coach Herb Brooks, Manager Craig Patrick, and Russian players Vladislav Tretiak and Boris Mikhailov, with commentary by ABC Sports broadcasters Al Michaels (who yelled, "Do you believe in miracles?" as time expired) and Jim Lampley.
