Mikko, an exchange student from Finland, arrives in Kansas City. He is expecting to spend a year in the centre of the big city but the plans have already changed. He has a new host family, who live on a farm far outside the city. The life in the countryside becomes much more exciting when he gets to know the sheriff's daughter and falls in love. Too bad that the father doesn't allow it. When the harmless trip to the out-of-town bar goes terribly wrong, Mikko has to face a very serious reality. The concealed hatred between certain characters doesn't make the situation any easier.
