A boy (Jake T. Austin) begins a grand journey to return Babe Ruth's baseball bat before the deciding game of the 1932 World Series comes to a close.
A young boy named Yankee Irving finds himself at an extraordinary crossroads: He has a chance to be a hero - and make a difference against incredible odds - or he can play it safe. With faith in himself instilled by his family, he teams up with a sassy young girl and some off-the-wall sidekicks and embarks on a sometimes perilous, often funny, cross-country quest. In the process, he restores his family's honor, befriends the world's biggest sports superstar, and reveals the hero within.
"Everyone's Hero" is a heartwarming comedy-adventure, telling the story of a young boy's thousand-mile journey to help Babe Ruth and the New York Yankees win the World Series. The project's theme of perseverance against all odds was inspired by the film's originating director and executive producer, Christopher Reeve.
