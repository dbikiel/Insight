A feudal village in Southeastern Turkey in 1970's. A poor peasant, Feyzo returns from military service dreaming about getting married to GÃ¼lo, the love of his life. However, he has to face many obstacles. According to tradition, a man has to pay a lot of money to the bride's father in order to get the bride's hand. While Feyzo is trying to deal with the greed of Gulo's father who is asking for an astronomical amount of money, he has to also convince his mother, who wants to buy an ox instead of a bride. Feyzo overcomes all these difficulties, but he gets kicked out of the village on his wedding day by the landlord, Maho Aga, who is eager to protect his status against any threat. However, Feyzo goes to the big city on exile only to bring back more problems for Maho.
