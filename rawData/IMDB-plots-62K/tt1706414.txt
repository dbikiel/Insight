The action takes place shortly after the end of the Second World War in the Siberian hinterland, among Russians and Germans with damaged personal stories and a strange transformation: the victors seem to be crawling into the skins of the defeated, and vice versa.

The heroes set up an almost fatal race in the Siberian forest, risking their own lives and those of others.
