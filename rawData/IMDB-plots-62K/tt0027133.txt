Angela Twitchell is the daughter of a tooth-paste manufacturer, Rufus K. Twitchell, who has monopolized the business for many years that he has grown conservative, and his rivals have begin to cut into his sales. Angela wants to enter the business but he thinks women have no place in a man's world. Inventor, Elmer Niles, tries to interest Mr. Twitchell in his line of toothpaste with various cocktail flavors, but is shown the door. Angela sees the possibilities in the idea; while retaining ownership she licenses it to one of her father's business rivals under the stipulation she will go on the road for a year and sell the product. She steals her father's customers right out from under the nose of her father's best salesman, Pat O,Connor, whom she falls in love with. It's whoopee at night and all-business during the day. Claudette Ruggles, a drug-store owner, also has designs on O'Connor.
