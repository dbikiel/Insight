LA police captain attempts to appease Sunset Strip businessmen objecting to hippy youths hanging out, by setting a curfew. The cop also thinks the kids have a right to be there, until his estranged daughter joins the counter-culture crowd.
A police captain (Aldo Ray) is caught between businesses operating on the Los Angeles Sunset Strip who don't like the punks hanging out, and his belief in allowing the kids their rights. But when his daughter (Mimsy Farmer) gets involved with an unruly bunch, his attitude starts to change.
Restless kids want to hang out in Hollywood clubs, smoke a little pot and do a little underage drinking. The local businessmen want to crush them, but the LAPD sergeant in charge wants to help them out, extend the curfew a bit and work with them. The kids break their side of the bargain and have a party at a mansion they have broken into, and a girl (conveniently the chief's estranged daughter) is given acid and taken advantage of by five different guys. When the chief roughs up some of the rapists there is reaction on the street. Despite his earlier reaction, the sergeant goes on the street to make sure that rioting kids are treated with kid gloves. His daughter agrees to reunite with him based on his integrity in handling the riot.
