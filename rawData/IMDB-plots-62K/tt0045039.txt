Trials and tribulations beset the one hundred odd settlers that journey to Virginia in 1620 including unexpectedly arriving in Plymouth, Massachusetts.
The story of the voyage of the "Mayflower" in its historic voyage across the Atlantic to the New World. The passenger list includes John Alden and Priscilla Mullins among those who made the 96-day storm-filled crossing. Along the way the Captain has an ill-starred romance with the wife of a religious fanatic that ends in a sudden, dramatic way off the coast of Cape Cod.
In 1620, Capt. Christopher Jones and his ship the Mayflower are contracted to carry a group of religious non-conformists to Virginia in the New World. The travelers are looking for a land where they can worship according to their beliefs. Jones however is simply a businessman interested to make a profit. Before the ship leaves, he is offered a tidy sum to ensure the settlers are landed in New England, not Virginia. The voyage is long and hard and owing to a late departure, arrives in New England at the outset of winter. Jones becomes attracted to Dorothy Bradford, the wife of Charles Bradford whose diary provides the chronicles of their voyage and early settlement. After tragedy strikes, Jones' attitude changes from one of a hard-hearted businessman simply transporting goods to someone who genuinely wishes to help the settlers succeed in their new home.
