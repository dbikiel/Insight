Phone technician Cezars Kalnins in his free time composes songs and performs in a band created with his friends. However getting the band to perform in public has to go a long way in getting permissions.
Set in Riga in 1967, the film deals with the challenges faced by creative young people under an authoritarian regime where artistic freedom is restricted and national culture under assault. In his free time, phone technician Cezars Kalnins (Uldis Pucitis) writes songs and plays in a rock band called 'The Optimists'. While the band is trying secure permission to perform in public, Anita Sondore (Dina Kuple), a member of the Youth Aesthetics Education Committee, writes a report criticising Cezars' lyrics as 'frivolous' and 'unsuitable'.
