Amidst the rain in a singing city, two umbrellas - one blue, one not - fall eternally in love.
It's pouring with rain in the bustling city during rush hour and the wet citizens crowd on the pavement, holding tightly their umbrellas. But in this sea of crammed and almost identical black canopies, one red and one blue umbrella set a strikingly refreshing contrast, and, who knows, maybe the stage for a beautiful and heart-warming love story.
