Harkin Banks heads to skiing championships in California. A teen runaway tags along as he parties and competes with friends and foes.
Harkin Banks is a young Idaho farm kid who is also an ace at skiing. He is headed to the freestyle skiing championships in Squaw Valley, CA along with runaway Sunny. He meets his adversary in the form of Rudy, a self centered European skier who doesn't take a liking to Harkin or his new found friends, The Rat Pack, led by veteran Dan O' Callahan. Harkin has many misadventures with Dan and his buddies, but doesn't lose focus in his attempt to get the World Cup.
Harkin Banks is a naive, skiing-obsessed, young man from Idaho who travels to Sqwak Mountain, California to compete in the FIA International Skiing Competition. Along the way Harkin picks up wild and outgoing teenage runaway, Sunny, who decides to tag along with him. Then Harkin meets skiing professional Dan O'Callahan and his group of misfit skiers to compete against the arrogant, three-time FIA Austrian champion Rudi Garmisch. While Harkin squares off with Rudi by day, he and Dan go partying by night with their friends which includes hot-tub and steam-room making out with various women, including Rudi's former bombshell flame Sylvia.
