A single and lonely woman finds the seemingly perfect man to date, but soon regrets it when his deranged and possessive other personality emerges and worst still, she cannot convince anyone else of his Jekyll/Hyde true nature.
Martha is a single woman working at a television talk show. When her younger sister gets married, everyone's wondering when Martha is going to meet Mr. Right and tie the knot. When by chance, Martha meets a handsome stranger named Whitman, the two fall madly in love with each other. But soon Martha discovers little quirks in Whitman... little quirks that become horrifying nightmares. But by the time Martha realizes that she must break up with him, it'll take more than subtle hints to make him go away -- she'll have to get into the most outrageous predicaments to rid herself of Mr. Wrong.
