Fun, disarming and musically provocative, the Topp Twins are New Zealand's finest lesbian country and western singers and the country's greatest export since rack of lamb and the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy.
If you see only one documentary about lesbian, country-singing, comedian twins from New Zealand, make this the one! Jools and Linda Topp have become phenomenally successful among the Kiwis for the sprightly combination of comical characters and catchy ditties, and this exuberant film captures the joy they bring both to their performance and to their daily lives. If you aren't already a Topp Twins fans, you'll be one by the end of this delightful doc.
