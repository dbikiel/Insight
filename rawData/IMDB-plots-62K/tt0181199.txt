To cure a Prince's murderous madness, Scheherezade tells him a series of wonderous stories.
Long ago, the Sultan Shahryar (Dougray Scott) has gone mad after his traumatizing near assassination, in which his wife collaborated and died at his hands as a result. Now he has a paranoid suspicion of women which he plans to express in a diabolical plan, and that is to marry a woman from the harem and then have her executed the next morning. To prevent this, the Grand Vizier's daughter and a childhood friend of the Sultan, Scheherezade (Mili Avital), offers herself to be that bride. Now, she must gamble that her plan will work as she tries to cure his madness by telling him story after wondrous story, which include the tales of Ali Baba (Rufus Sewell) and the Forty Thieves and Aladdin (Jason Scott Lee) and his Wonderful Lamp. All the while, the Sultan's villainous brother is making plans of his own, and Scheherezade's stories are more useful against him than anyone can anticipate.
