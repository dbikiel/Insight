A single mom plays in the local ice hockey team. She plays pretty well - for a girl. Provoked, she bets that a woman's team can beat the local team of men. Can she build up a winning team in 4 weeks?
The story takes the battle of the sexes into the hockey arena, as Paula Taymore - who almost once made the Olympic team - finds herself drawn into a challenge match against an irritating local men's squad. Fresh from a painful divorce, and doubting herself, Paula must make a winner out of an explosive, irreverent crew of women hockey players who flock to her town, Red Deer Alberta, to assemble the team.
