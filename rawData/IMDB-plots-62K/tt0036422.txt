Two producers are putting together a wartime charity show with an all-star cast but the egotism of radio personality Eddie Cantor disrupts their plans.
Two producers are putting together a Calvacade of Stars for a wartime charity show. Along with a list of well-knowns they promote the work of an unknown singer and songwriter.
Eddie Cantor insists upon being chairman of the Cavalcade of Stars benefit show, in return for the use of his vocalist, Dinah Shore. Cantor disrupts the producers' plans with his own egocentric ideas. When they discover a talented bus driver named Joe Simpson, who can't get an acting job because he too closely resembles Eddie Cantor, a scheme is hatched to put the show back on track.
