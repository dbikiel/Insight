Former acclaimed dancer Na Young-sae (Park Keon-Hyeong) attempts to make a comeback after his opponent, Hyun-soo (Yoon Chan), purposely injures him at a dance competition. At the suggestion of dance studio manager Ma Sang-doo (Park Won-sang), Young-sae then brings to Korea Jang Chae-rin (Moon Geun-Young), an ethnic Korean from China whom he presumes is a renowned, talented dancer. To his surprise, Young-sae learns Chae-rin knows nothing about dancing and her soon-to-be married older sister, Chae-min, is the talented dancer. With only three months until the national dance championship, Young-sae trains Chae-rin, vowing to turn turn her a world-class dancer.
