Dr. Peter Carey is a pathologist at a Boston hospital. The daughter of the hospital's Chief of Staff dies after an illegal abortion goes wrong, and Carey's friend and colleague Dr. David Tao is accused of performing the abortion. Carey doesn't buy it, and so he digs deeper, angering the girl's father in the process. Questions abound: Who performed the abortion? Was the girl really pregnant? And what does it have to do with stolen morphine, blackmail attempts, and a mysterious and dangerous masseur?
Dr. Peter Carey's a pathologist at Boston Memorial Hospital. His friend, Dr. David Tao, has just been implicated in the murder of 15 year old Karen Randall, the daughter of the hospital's chief of staff, Dr. Randall. At the time of her death, Karen was 4 months pregnant, and had gone to Dr. Tao to perform an abortion. She bled out, and as she lay dying, blamed Dr. Tao to her mother. David admits he does perform the service, and that Karen did come to him, but he refused to help, due to her advanced stage. Dr. Carey doesn't fully believe his good friend, and starts his own investigation, angering the girl's father in the process. As things unfold, questions appear; what's the connection between the abortions and stolen morphine, blackmail attempts, and a mysterious and dangerous masseuse?
