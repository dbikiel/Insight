A mad doctor puts together a new body by using body parts he steals from a mortuary at the hospital where he works.
Dr. Bob Frankenstein (Mark Blankfield) is the great-great grandson of Victor. Unlike Victor, however, he is working at a Los Angeles General Hospital as an intern under the name of Dr. Robert Frankenheimer. What his coworkers do not know, however, is that he has a laboratory, which is in B&amp;W while everything else is in color (because it has been "drained of color", Bob says) and along with his dimwitted, two left-legged hunch-back Iggy, he intends to create the perfect human to succeed where his ancestors failed. However, as usual, the experiment goes wrong when Iggy steals the brain of a sex and food starved teenager instead of a brilliant mind, and the resulting Monster (Irwin Keyes) wreaks havoc through General Hospital.
