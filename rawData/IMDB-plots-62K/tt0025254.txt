Two salesmen try to market a flavored lipstick.
To help a girl keep her job, two small time salesmen, Andy and Dudley, talk her boss, a lady head of a cosmetics firm, into selling their line of flavored lipsticks. They become business partners and romantic interests. After a promotional campaign on a musical variety radio program, the lipsticks are a big success. The boys accidentally misplace a bag with the company's securities, which in turn is secretly stolen by their crooked manager. Andy and Dudley, now charged with embezzlement, are on the run when they get themselves into an auto race, where their car is sponsored by their company and their business competitor backs the rival car in the race.
Todd stars as Amelia Frisby, the owner of a beauty supply business. Andy Williams (Wheeler) and Dr. Bob Dudley (Woolsey) convince her to hire them as salesman to promote her new flavored lipstick, and hilarity ensues. The film features Etting singing "Keep Romance Alive" and Bert Wheeler and Dorothy Lee singing "Keep On Doin' What You're Doin'" by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby.
