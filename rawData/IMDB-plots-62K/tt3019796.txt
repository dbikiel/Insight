The summer holidays begin, Nicolas and his family travel to the seaside where a whole new series of adventures await them.
It's the end of the school year. The long-awaited moment of summer vacation has arrived. Little Nicolas, his parents, and Grandma head to Hotel Beau-Rivage by the seaside. On the beach, Nicolas quickly makes a new set of friends: there's Blaise, who isn't on vacation because he lives in the area, Fructueux, who likes everything, even fish, Djodjo, who doesn't speak like them because he's English, Crépin, who cries all the time, and Côme, who always wants to be right and who is very annoying. But Nicolas also gets to know Isabelle, a little girl who always looks at him with big, round and worried eyes, and who Nicolas believes his parents want to force him to marry. Misunderstandings accumulate, blunders begin. One thing's for sure: for everyone, this will be an unforgettable vacation.
Finally, school's out for summer--and after the traditional annual argument--Nicolas' parents decide to go to the ocean for a change, at the seaside Hôtel Beau-Rivage. This time, the cranky grandmother has to come along; however, Nicolas' new friends are always around to lend a hand or to make things worse. They are a lively beach gang of holidaymakers: the young glutton, Fructueux; the little Englishman with the heavy accent, Djodjo; the opinionated, Côme; the cry-baby, Crépin; the rich boy, Blaise, and the sweet girl, Isabelle. This year, love is in the air. Is this going to be the best summer ever?
