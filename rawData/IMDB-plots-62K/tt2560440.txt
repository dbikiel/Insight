A sixteen-year-old boy gets wrapped in plastic, and lowered into a tank truck full of crude oil. That's how Hisham Zaman's long awaited feature film debut begins.
BEFORE SNOWFALL is a road movie that becomes an odyssey from East to West for young Siyar, a village-boy from Iraqi-Kurdistan. His journey begins when his older sister, Nermin, flees her wedding. Siyar's father is dead, and as the eldest son, he is obliged to set out to find his sister and restore his family honour in the local village. In Istanbul he meets the young girl Evin. They travel together. Their journey through Greece, Germany (Berlin) and Norway makes Siyar's search for his sister a search for dignity and love.
