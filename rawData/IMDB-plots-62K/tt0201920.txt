On their new adventure, the old friends intend to protect nature from unscrupulous poachers.
Crocodile Gena and Cheburashka go to sea rest by train, but Shapoklyak steals their tickets and wallet. Therefore, friends are disembarked at the first station 200 km from Moscow. Crocodile Gena and Cheburashka were only 1 km (up to 199 km to Moscow), getting out of the way and passing things that are picked up by the Shapoklyak on the trolley. Then friends together fight with tourists-poachers and for ecological cleanliness of woods and small rivers of Moscow suburbs.
