Deeply affected by a personal tragedy, an office drone comes to realize his sense of hearing has taken on extraordinary capabilities that could drive him insane.
Larry Pearce is a dour office worker in a phone answering company who is having problems getting over the recent death of his young son from a rare brain disorder. Larry's grief has somehow triggered his acute sense of hearing 20-fold which he can hear a whispered conversation from hundreds of feet away. But his ability soon affects his sanity as he learns he cannot control it and all efforts to block out sound are futile, which puts a strain on his long-suffering wife Brenda, who unlike him, cannot stand quiet. As as result, Larry's slow slide into insanity because of his gift/curse of sensitive hearing and inability to deal with the grief of the loss of his son, leads to more tragedy for all involved.
