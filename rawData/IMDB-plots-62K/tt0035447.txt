Life at the Marine Training Base in San Diego on the eve of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
Sergeant Dixie Smith has more raw recruits to turn into Marines, if he can. Among them is cocky casanova Chris Winters, son of an officer, who's just tried to "mash" Mary Carter, a major's niece. Once on base, he finds Mary's a nurse and an off-limits officer. Does this stop him? Of course not. But his attitude problem soon puts him in a position where he must redeem himself, with December 7, 1941 fast approaching.
An irreverent and selfish young man, Chris Winters, joins the US Marines before America's entry into World War II. His drill instructor, Sgt. Dixie Smith, served in World War I with his father and Chris fully expects an easy ride. He went to a military academy - until he was expelled - and has the makings of a good soldier, if only he would take it just a bit more seriously. Beautiful nurse Mary Carter catches his eye and he spends much of his time trying to win her affections. He's also doing his best to get out of the Marines but on the day he submits his resignation, the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor.
