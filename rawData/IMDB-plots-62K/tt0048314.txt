Mona Andrews arrives by plane in Laghaso Station, Africa, to visit her uncle, Commissioner Andy Barnes, just as three elephant hunters, Jeff Woode, Paul Gavin and Kenny Balou, set out under orders from the district governor to exterminate a herd of elephants that has been terrorizing native villages. Bomba is appalled by this as the elephants are his friends and he knows they are being led by one rogue bull. He is willing to have the rogue bull killed but not the others. The three hunters, evidently paid by the head, seize Bomba, tie him and leave him guarded by two natives, Eli and Molu. Mona helps Bomba escape and he locates the herd and arranges for the rogue elephant to be killed by Barnes as, despite reports elsewhere to the contrary, Bomba kills no elephants before, during or after their time.
