A group of friends wind up in the Bermuda Triangle.
Stu, Tommy, and Gus decide to celebrate their new business venture with an exotic vacation to Bermuda. It's the perfect getaway until Stu begins to obsess about the Queen of Scots, a ship lost 50 years ago to the Bermuda Triangle. Determined that the lost ship is out there, filled with the former occupants' riches, Stu charters a boat with a desperate captain and his beautiful first mate, Charlie. When their boat hits a dense fog they become lost and panicked until they see something slowly creeping through the curtain of fog, it's the Queen of Scots. After boarding the ship they discover that something happened to the passengers, something horrible, and it's starting to happen to them. Now they're trapped in a ghost ship, in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle, and there's no way out!
