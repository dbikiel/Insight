With the impressive "Between Something &amp; Nothing," Todd Verow (Vacationland, Bulldog in the Whitehouse) once again revisits his own past, recounting the life of a freshman art school student whose relationship with a mysterious hustler leads him to work the streets himself. Joe arrives at the prestigious Rhode Island School of Design and immediately befriends like-minded Jennifer. Together they tackle seemingly endless and outlandish art assignments while also exploring the music and drugs of the local scene. Alone, however, the outwardly innocent Joe secretly pursues local hustler Ramon, finding liberation and inspiration for his artwork while exploring his darker side. It seems that nothing better than hot sex and working the streets for money brings out the true artist in Joe.
