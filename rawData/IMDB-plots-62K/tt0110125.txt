A troubled detective befriends a single woman and her daughter with the intention of using them as bait for a serial killer.
In the countryside of an Eastern Europe country, three little girls are murdered in the wood by a pedophile and found naked with one precise cut on the throat. Detective Viktor Marek, who has come from the city, investigates the case, but his superior Pavel Nowak arrests a scapegoat, the pothead Alexi Berka, and tortures the youngster to confess the murder since he is disputing the elections. Marek does not agree with the result of the investigation and resigns his job but continues to track the killer. While following a lead in an old road, Marek meets the girl Anna Tatour that has a flat tire of her bicycle and he offers a ride in his car to the girl. Then, he tells to Anna's mother, Milena Tatour, that she should instruct her daughter to not accept ride from strangers. Marek becomes obsessed to hunt down the pedophile and he decides to rent an old gas station in the old road near to the place where the crimes where committed to see the cars that use the road and he invites Milena to cook for him with the intention of secretly using Anna as a bait. Meanwhile the killer is the disturbed pediatrician Vladimir Kozant, who puts his eyes on Anna while refueling in the gas station. But Marek has fallen in love with Milena and Anna and he decides to call-off his investigation.
