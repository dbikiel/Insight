Viking village Flake's chief Halvar orders clever, tiny son Wickie to rob a knights convoy. The warriors have to take over but fail to see Wicki being abducted with a cargo of Eskimo slaves, who also carry a mysterious manuscript on the eternal ice palace containing the Norse gods' treasure. Wickie escapes, and the thief who refuses to help him comes along as stowaway. Wickie works out the manuscript, but before the men can sail, they are drugged and Halvar is abducted. Chieftaincy now falls by customary law to Wickie, who needs to grow on the job in several senses.
