The Wolf was crushed by the fallen tree. The noble Deer helped him to get out, having heard a request for help and a promise not to touch. But the Wolf did not keep his word and instead of gratitude attacked the Deer. The Squirrel, who saw everything, told it to the Bear. Wise Bear judged the disputants, demanding that he was shown how everything was, and taught the ungrateful Wolf.
