Innocent lives hang on the whim of an elusive psychopathic murderer whose strange riddles and impossible timelines force three people into a mission to end the game before one or all of them die.
THR3E (based on the novel by Ted Dekker)The Riddle Killer, responsible for the death of police psychologist Jennifer Peters' (Justine Waddell) brother, Roy Peters (Adam Malecki), appears to be behind the attempted murder and stalking of seminary student Kevin Parson (Marc Blucas).Bent on getting Parson to make some kind of confession, the Riddle Killer seemingly turns out to be a boy from Parson's neighborhood named Slater (Bill Mosely), who terrorized the young Parson and his good friend, Samantha Sheer (Laura Jordan)."Sam" devotes her insurance investigating skills to help the troubled Parson, whose parents were killed in a car accident when he was a young boy, and who subsequently was raised in the home of his extremely strict (and strange!) aunt, Balinda (Priscilla Barnes).Also included in the family are his uncle, Eugene (Tom Bower), cousin, Bobby (Jeffrey Lee Hollis) and pet dog, Damon.The number three figures prominently in the story and most obviously seems to refer to the number of days in the unfolding storyline, but ultimately comes to represent something far more strange and significant.
