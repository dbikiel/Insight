A small American contingent tries to train rural tribesmen to defend themselves against fanatical Muslim radicals in 1906 Philippines.
In 1906 the American army pulls out of Mindanao leaving a handful of officers to try and get the Philippines Constabulary into shape to protect the native population from ruthless invaders. By reputation and by their exploits the fearless zealots initially strike terror into the local militia but the doctor on the post starts to finds ways to combat this.
The American army men are in Mindanao (not Manila), the second largest island in the Philippines and in the south-east. They are training the Filipinos to protect the native population from ruthless Moslem suicide bombers. Mindanao had and still does have a large active Moslem activists, who where still bombing in the 1970's. When I was there in 1976 and visiting MIT (Mindanao Institute of Technology) they set off a bomb on campus and killed several students.
