Work has been going with a bang for freelance assassin Hawkins but a job in England is a different matter. His apparently easy target, a pompous government minister, is off for some hanky-panky at the Green Man on the south coast, where Hawkins is planning to retire him for good. But before he can get on with this the hit-man has a procession of unwanted visitors at home to dispose of - one way or another.
When he is not working as a watchmaker, Hawkins is a professional assassin. His current target is pompous industrialist Sir Gregory Upshoot, who he plans to kill at the Green Man hotel. His plans are interrupted by vacuum cleaner salesman William Blake who stumbles onto the plot. When no one in authority believes him, William travels to the Green Man to save Sir Gregory
