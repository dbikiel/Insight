14-year-old Madeinusa comes of age during the Easter festivities of her tiny, isolated village.
Madeinusa is a 14-year-old girl with a sweet Indian face. She lives in an isolated village in Peru's Cordillera Blanca Mountain range, a strange place characterized by its religious fervor. From Good Friday at three o'clock in the afternoon (the time of day when Christ died on the cross) to Easter Sunday, everyone in the village can do whatever they want. During the two holy days sin does not exist: God is dead and can't see what is happening. Everything is accepted and allowed, without remorse. Year after year, Madeinusa, her sister Chale, and their father Don Cayo, the Mayor and local big shot, maintain this tradition without questioning it. However, everything changes with the arrival in the village of Salvador, a young geologist from Lima who will unknowingly change the girl's destiny.
