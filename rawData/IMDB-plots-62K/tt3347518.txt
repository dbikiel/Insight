Natalie and Nick are frustrated with their luck in romance. After tossing coins into a fountain, the two then begin dreaming about each other. But, according to fountain mythology, they only have a week to turn those dreams into reality.
Nick Smith, a talented architect employed by an unappreciative scrooge but contemplating a firm of his own with colleague Joe Yablonski, suffers pointless attempts by his mother to match him up. Yet after he tosses a coin with his kid cousin in a legendary magical love fountain, at the same time as Natalie Russo, the two touch and program them to dream of each-other as lovers seven times, longing to meet for real but doubting if the dream partner even exists. She runs her mother's ailing Italian restaurant, which recovers thanks to flirtatious Italian chef Mario, who has an unrequited crush on Nat. The last night, each finds the other's trail, but has a pressing professional priority while they seem only to cross while the magical time window runs out.
