A young man, Pat, visits the clan of gypsy-like grifters in rural North Carolina who belong to the nomadic ethnic group known as Irish Travellers and from whom he is descended. Pat is at first rejected but cousin Bokky takes him on as an apprentice. Pat learns the game while Bokky falls in love and desires a different life.
The Costello family belong to the nomadic gypsy-like ethnic group known as Irish Travellers. The family lives in rural North Carolina and their business is scamming. Their cousin, a young man named Pat, meets up with them and learns their cons and crafts. Soon, Pat is doing paving hustles and falls in love with a girl, and so does his cousin and mentor Bokky. Things escalate when one of them tries to leave the clan to start a new life.
On the highways and backwoods of the rural south, a coterie of Irish grifters live in a world distinctly and exclusively their own. Moving from town to town, the Travellers make their living through the family business, conning and scamming nearly everyone whose path they cross. Into this world ventures Pat O'Hara who returns to the Travellers to bury his father, once a Traveller cast out for marrying an outsider. He is shunned by the head of the clan but cautiously accepted by Bokky who takes the young man under his wing and teaches him the way of their forefathers. The two take to the road running con jobs and always staying one step ahead of the law. Along the way they meet Jean, a hard working bartender and single mother, and promptly devise a plan to swindle away her hard-earned money. But Bokky's instinct for quick cash and fast getaways runs into an unexpected obstacle... his heart.
