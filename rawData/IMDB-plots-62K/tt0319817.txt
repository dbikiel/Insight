After a poor man marries a rich woman, he has to contend with his rich, arrogant mother-in-law.
Aarumugam gatecrashes a marriage to abduct the bride. Geetha, the bride's friend, gets him arrested but then learns that he had rescued the girl from a forced marriage. Further revelations about him that he is a gold medalist and has a good heart make her fall in love with him. After some convincing, Aarumugam reciprocates too. Meanwhile, Aarumugam's sister is in love with the son of a rich woman Rajarajeswari. When Rajarajeswari learns of this, she foists a false police case on her and gets her jailed. It is then that Aarumugam has his first encounter with Rajarajeswari and also learns that she is none other than Geetha's mother. He also invites her to his marriage. At that time he calls his friend (Chiranjeevi in a cameo) and tells him that during his marriage goons will try to stop it. He requests Chiranjeevi to look after the goons and he comes, fights off the goons, attends the marriage and goes. Since Aarumugam has married Geetha against her mother's wishes, Rajarajeswari vows to separate them while Aarumugam vows to prevent that and make Rajarajeswari understand that love and affection are more important than money.
