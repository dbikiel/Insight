Colonel Ed Wyatt (Dan Duryea) is regarded by pilots under his command as being a ruthless disciplinarian. His co-pilot, Lt. Hobson Lee (Mike Connors as Touch Connors), and Jo McWethy (Frances Gifford), a war correspondent assigned to the squadron become more friendly than meets Wyatt's approval. When Wyatt's plane is forced down behind enemy lines, he orders his crew to proceed to the American lines with the vital film they have shot, while he remains behind to hold off the enemy.
