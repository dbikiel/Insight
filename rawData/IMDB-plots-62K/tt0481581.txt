About two families (one white, one Asian) who come together unexpectedly on a local night of carnival trickery and festivity.
Mischief Night is a British comedy film... It is the third instalment of the Tina Trilogy following on from Tina Goes Shopping and Tina Takes a Break. However, unlike the previous two Channel 4 films Mischief Night broadens its scope to consider the wider community that Tina lives in and address issues of racial segregation. Tina is played by Kelli Hollis in all three films Funny, moving and clever, this treatise of working class life as it really is i.e told by the people who actually live it, is such a breath of fresh air. The story comes together so well at the end and just leaves you feeling so uplifted - its a million miles from the way this government talks about Muslims, youth culture and drugs - they don't shy away from letting you know things are bad but somehow you just feel that if you ignore the spin and just get on with the fibre of life itself you'll get through and they do this by letting the comedy build and not filling it with stupid "witty" one-liners, in other words you really care about the people who inhabit this film..

Tina Crabtree lives on the White side of the park with her three unruly children, Kimberly, Tyler and Macauley. On the Asian side lives Immie Khan with his lively family. As the clock ticks down to Mischief Night, the Crabtrees and the Khans are unaware that their worlds are about to collide. In the course of one night, the barriers that separate both families come tumbling down in a blaze of crime, clubbing, love and fireworks changing all their lives forever. [D-Man2010]
