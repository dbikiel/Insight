A corrupt lieutenant in the homicide division is threatened by the righteous DA while trying to solve a string of mysterious murders.
Set in New Orleans. Remy McSwain, lieutenant in Homicide finds that he has two problems, the first of a series of gang killings and Ann Osborne, a beautiful attorney from the D.A.'s police corruption task force in his office. He begins a relationship with her as the killings continue only to have charges filed against him for accepting bribes as he stumbles on a police corruption Sting. While this is happening, the criminals insist that none of the crime gangs are behind the killings.
McSwain reckons he's an honest cop, though he's happy to go along with the kickbacks from the precinct 'Widows and Orphans Fund'. When it comes to murder he's definitely on the right side and is irritated to find his latest investigation being followed by Anne Osborne from the D.A.'s office. Out of work they hit it off pretty quickly, making it difficult for Anne to handle when his more questionable activities come to light and she has to prosecute him. In turn McSwain starts to suspect that he's investigating something more than mob slayings.
