The police inspector keeps telling him to be patient as most stolen cars are recovered eventually. However, John becomes more and more desperate and impatient to re-claim his car. Against the advice of the police, he sets-out to investigate the matter himself. This will eventually bring him on a direct collision course with Lionel Meadows and his gang of chop-shop hoodlums.
