Sieg surprises his famous TV 'heroes' quartet mates by booking a luxury wellness resort in the Ardennes for the weekend. Despite mixed feelings about such a 'dull adult holiday', Dempsey and Nico give it a go, but Maureen sulks and pleads an alternative, having heard from old staff about a cool 'oldest tree' of the Condroz region, reserved from groups of friends. She leaves a note and sets out alone, hurting herself and being helped by lonely forester Wendy, whose only company is her old, flatulent dog Windy. Sieg's theory she's only setting them up is outvoted, but when the three boys find her, she has lost the map and Sieg is duly furious to end up lost in the woods. Dempsey'(s ingenuity and Nico's fighting spirit win out to make the best of it, improvising camping, air lift and the salvation of the tree from Wendy, who turns bitter after Windy dies from old age.
