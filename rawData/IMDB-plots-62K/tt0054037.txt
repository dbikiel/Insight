In 1942, a group of British soldiers is sent on a mission in the Malaysian jungle and gets lost into the Japanese controlled zone.
A troop of British soldiers are out in the jungle to record jungle noises and troop noises in the jungle so that the recordings can be played back by other troops to divert the enemy to their whereabouts. As they progress to what they think is closer to the base camp they find themselves farther and farther from radio range until the only channel they can get clearly is that of a Japanese broadcast. They now realize they are probably only 10 to 15 miles from a Japanese camp! The tension is added to by rowdy and openly admitted "non-hero" Private Bamforth who has nothing good to say about anyone and especially Corporal Johnstone (who holds an equal dislike for Bamforth). When a Japanese soldier is taken as their prisoner, the true colors of each man comes to the surface ...
A bitter struggle within the Malaysian jungle of 1942. Cast with differing points of views and attitudes that, when caught in the crossfire of the Japanese might, and taking on a P.O.W., only highlights and ignites the predicament that sorts the men from the boys. This is jungle warfare with a conscience and towards its climax more than just blood, sweat and tears shall surface from the depths of this torrid jungle affair.
