Two fishing fanatics get in trouble when their fishing boat gets stolen while on a trip.
Two working-class buddies, Joe and Gus, win a contest and get a free fishing trip. When they arrive, everything goes wrong - hurricanes, stolen car, blow-ups and other catastrophes follow them.
Joe and Gus are established early on as two of life's losers. As children, they are shown in opening sequences blowing up an industry as they toss a cigarette in an open pipe. Years later, as adults they get to go on a fishing vacation that you know has to go wrong. First, they are conned out of their car keys by a con man killer, who preys on older women. As they give pursuit, they team up with two young women who are also after the killer who took all of Arquette's mother's jewelry and money. Many disasters later, the two are faced with the killer and all of his loot. Willie Nelson makes a brief appearance as a philosopher fisherman that the two amateur fishermen worship.
