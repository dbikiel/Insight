A young woman released on parole vows to ruin the life of the man who insisted on sending her to jail.
A desperate young woman is caught taking part in a department store extortion racket and sent to jail. When she's let out on parole, she schemes to ruin the life of the man who wouldn't give her a second chance, the man responsible for her time behind bars. Taking advantage of the man's inebriated state, the woman stages a phony marriage and, knowing of the man's estranged wife, blackmails him with bigamy charges. Forced to keep up appearances as the happily married couple until the woman's parole runs out, the man and the woman grow fonder of each other than either would dare to admit.
