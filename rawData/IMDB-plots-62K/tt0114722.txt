Somewhere in Latin America, there appears overnight the corpse of a known mobster, Miguel "el chino" Sanabria. The evidence suggests that his death was a brutal crime of passion, an explanation that satisfies everyone except Ferrán, a grim and bitter detective from the slums of the city, who suspects that there may be something more sinister behind this crime than simple passion. Ferrán and Picasso, the yuppie who owns the bar where Sanabria was last seen alive, will embark on a journey through the strange and alienating universe of the nightclubs of the city. Three nights will pass in this journey, which will transform them both, carrying each of them toward a shared and inevitable destiny.
