The coming-of-age story about a Canadian First Nations girl who triumphs over obstacles in her young life. Her new teacher discovers her extraordinary gifts as a violinist. When Shana goes on a spiritual journey, she befriends a wild wolf who guides her and she reconnects with her ancestors, including her mother. Finally, she is able to make peace with her mother's death and, absorbed by nature and the spiritual world, Shana finds a unique way of musical expression, which will allow her to have a career as a violinist. Filmed with the People of the Creeks, the Lower Nicola Indian Band near Merritt, BC. The entire cast is local and first time film performers. The Swiss director Nino Jacusso who spent seven months with them calls them 'real actors' as they are the real people. A moving, magical, and yet authentic inter-cultural motion picture.
