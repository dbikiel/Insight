Immediately after his death, the victim of a car crash gets answers to every question he's ever had about his life, including the most import one of all - what did it all mean?
Sadly, that's it. Young and lively Nathan is irreversibly dead from a hideous car crash and there's nothing he can do about it. However, after the initial shock, Nathan discovers that there's actually a lot to do when you join the departed, such as find out the answers to life's great mysteries or maybe uncover what happened to your beloved missing dog. Either way, be careful of what you ask, because you may not like the answer.
