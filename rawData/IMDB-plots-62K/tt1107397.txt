In the countryside, the boy Alan and his friend Becky steal a creepy wooden box with a powerful voodoo stick inside from his voodooistic neighbor. When the boy draws with the stick, his drunken father is attacked by a snake and vanishes. Years later, Alan and Becky are married to each other; while planting some flowers to celebrate the death of Alan's mother, Becky finds the box buried in the garden and she keeps the stick in her pocket. Meanwhile, five friends are traveling in a monster truck, drinking beer. The driver accidentally runs over Becky, but believes he had hit an animal. When Alan witnesses the hit-and-run and sees his wife dead, he uses the stick seeking revenge against the youngsters.
Using Voodoo, an ancient African priest creates an indestructible evil drawing tool to be used for revenge. The Kulev Stick is rediscovered by a young boy in modern day America, and it conjures a giant serpent that kills his abusive dad. Terrified, the child buries it, and the monster hibernates in a sugar cane field nearby. 20 years later, the cursed instrument is dug up by his wife, who is accidentally killed by college teens vacationing in their small rural town. Vengeful, he again draws the monster, which awakens and starts killing them off one by one. Now the only thing that stands in its way is Army Special Ops Vet and master hunter Nick Kirabo who has been waiting for "Lockjaw" to return.
