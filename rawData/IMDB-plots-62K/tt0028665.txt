Steve Raleight wants to produce a show on Broadway. He finds a backer, Herman Whipple and a leading lady, Sally Lee. But Caroline Whipple forces Steve to use a known star, not a newcomer. Sally purchases a horse, she used to train when her parents had a farm before the depression and with two ex-vaudevillians, Sonny Ledford and Peter Trott she trains it to win a race, providing the money Steve needs for his show.
Aspiring impresario Steve Raleigh has managed to secure financing for his latest Broadway show from Herman Whipple of Whipple Ice Cream. It isn't until later that Steve learns that the person who has the final say in the Whipple household is Whipple's wife, former chorus girl Caroline Whipple. What could kibosh that funding is Steve's determination to hire Sally Lee as the star of the show, she, just having arrived in New York, who has no name in the business, but who he believes is the best dancer he's ever seen in spying an impromptu performance. In addition to saving money as opposed to hiring someone with a name, Steve would admit that he is attracted to Sally. Steve, Sally, and a collection of new friends and potential performers in the show (including ex-vaudevillians Sonny Ledford and Peter Trot, theatrical rooming house operator and former Broadway performer Alice Clayton who also acts as the stereotypical stage mother to her teenage daughter Betty Clayton, and father and son Greek barbers George and Nicki Papaloopas, the latter who has a penchant for the Italian arias) try to secure that financing with a little help from Stargazer, Mrs. Whipple's racehorse who was raised by Sally.
