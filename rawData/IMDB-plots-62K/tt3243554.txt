Fatherless and raised by his grandmother, thirteen year old Ricardo Galam lives in South Africa's Cape Flats, a unique and volatile sub culture dominated by two Number gangs, the 26 and 28. Ricardo's future as a chess prodigy is threatened by his growing interest in the 26 whose local leader is grooming him as a potential member. Unknown to Ricardo, the father he's never known has been released from prison. Farakhan, a reformed general in the 28, is back in his old neighbourhood, an intruder in 26 territory. In a story that is at times raw and violent at other times touching and true. FOUR CORNERS is a gripping drama set against the backdrop of a gang war in Cape Town which has been raging for a 100 years; a little known fact.
The film also makes loose references to the "Station Stranger" that ravaged the Cape Flats in the early 1990's. Most communities around the Cape Flats feared for the lives of their sons by an unknown rapists and murderer. The film draws that fear into the already haunted and troubled characters. It does however end with a sense of hope and dream of a brighter future - that I found to be the most refreshing element of the entire film, that against all odds, it is possible to overcome your circumstances no matter how dire.
