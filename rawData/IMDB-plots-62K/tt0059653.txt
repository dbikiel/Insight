Three cowboys, mistaken for members of an outlaw gang, are relentlessly pursued by a posse.
Wes, Vern and Otis are three cowhands on the way to a cattle drive. Coming upon what is to be an omen of their future... an outlaw hung by a group of vigilantes...the trio finds shelter at a cabin, only to discover that their "hosts" are men who have robbed a stagecoach and killed the guard. When an avenging posse attacks the cabin, Wes and Vern escape, only to find that they have become branded as 'outlaws' by the posse, who relentlessly pursue them.
Forced to go on the lam like common criminals after a fateful encounter with Blind Dick's ruthless gang of outlaws, the unlucky trio of cowhands--Vern, Otis, and Wes--find themselves wrongly accused of being bandits. Pursued by an angry posse of vigilantes for crimes they didn't commit, the despairing fugitives seek refuge in the unforgiving deserts of Utah; however, as the unrelenting hanging squad is closing in on them, all hope seems lost. Can Wes and his friends ride to freedom?
