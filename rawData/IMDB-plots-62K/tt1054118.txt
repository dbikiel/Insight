The lifelong friendship of the great cinematographers Laszlo Kovacs and Vilmos Zsigmond and their impact on American cinema.
The artistry, triumph and lifelong friendship of the great cinematographers Laszlo Kovacs and Vilmos Zsigmond. With film school equipment, they shoot the Soviet crackdown of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. As refugees they struggle in Hollywood, finally breaking into the mainstream with their pivotal contribution to the "American New Wave."
They left one revolution behind only to create another. László Kovács and Vilmos Zsigmond filmed and survived the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, emmigrated in poverty to America, helped each other up the ladder out of the underbelly of Hollywood all the while holding onto their dreams. After ten years of no-budget toil, László's camera broke Hollywood's rules with EASY RIDER. Suddenly in demand, he recommended Vilmos to both Peter Fonda and Robert Altman where Zsigmond poured his "poetic realism" into THE HIRED HAND and MCCABE &amp; MRS. MILLER. They were the go-to camera guys of the New Hollywood. Among their 140 credits, Laszlo shot FIVE EASY PIECES, PAPER MOON, SHAMPOO, FRANCES, GHOSTBUSTERS and MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING and Vilmos lensed SCARECROW, THE SUGARLAND EXPRESS, CINDERELLA LIBERTY, THE ROSE, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, BLOW OUT, THE DEER HUNTER and HEAVEN'S GATE all the while elevating the visual style of our movies. This film has many threads: social, political and artistic. It is a Cold War story, an American immigrant story and a glamorous, Hollywood success story where dreams do come true. This is an intimate portrait of two giants of modern image-making and their deep bond of brotherhood that transcended every imaginable boundary. Two heroes. One road.
