Charts the headlong fall of Pinkie (Sam Riley), a razor-wielding disadvantaged teenager with a religious death wish.
An adaptation of Graham Greene's classic novel about a small-town hood who marries a waitress who deduced that he killed a rival thug in order to keep her quiet. As his gang begins to doubt his abilities, the man becomes more desperate and violent.
While Mods and Rockers fight on the Brighton beaches in 1964, Pinkie Brown (Sam Riley), member of Spicer's (Phil Davis') protection racket gang, aims to wipe out his boss and take over the town from rival mobster Colleoni (Andy Serkis). Prior to the murder of Fred, one of Colleoni's men, naive waitress Rose Wilson (Andrea Riseborough) had been on the pier and inadvertently photographed with Fred. Pinkie feigns courtship and marries Rose to keep her quiet, but Ida (Dame Helen Mirren), Rose's employer, and a friend of Fred, has her suspicions, and makes it her business to save Rose from Pinkie's clutches.
