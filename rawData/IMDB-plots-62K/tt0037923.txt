A vivacious actress needing work becomes a housekeeper for a crusty retired politician, and gives his life the shaking-up that it needs.
Molly, an actress desperate for work, decides to get it by "playing the part" of an experienced housekeeper. It turns out that the butler at her new household is doing the same thing. Their employer, Mr. Graham, is a retired politician who, divorced from his wife and estranged from his son, lives alone with a staff of servants. Graham's life needs shaking up and, with her enthusiasm and acting talent, Molly is just the one to help him do it when the opportunity arises.
