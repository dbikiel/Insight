Slowly, with Wolf's help, Davey realizes that she must get on with her life. A complicated story of deep human drama. Based on the classic novel,"Tiger Eyes," by Judy Blume.
Forced by her grieving mother to move from her home in Atlantic City to the strange "atom bomb" town of Los Alamos, New Mexico, 17-year-old Davey Wexler no longer knows who to be or how to fit in. Everything that once mattered - the friends, reputations, parties and expectations that fuel high school days - suddenly seems insignificant and Davey is certain no one has the first clue about the turmoil she is going through. But when she meets Wolf (Tatanka Means), a mysterious Native-American climber exploring the surrounding canyons, she feels he is able to see right into her most wild and secret emotions. Their intense relationship brings Davey back from the edge as she finds the courage to embark on the first great adventure of her life.
