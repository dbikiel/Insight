A dramatization of George Washington's perilous gamble of crossing the Delaware River and attacking the Hessian forces at Trenton.
In 1776, less than six months after the Declaraton of Independence, the Continental Army, under the command of General George Washington, was on the brink of utter defeat. Low on men, cannons and supplies, Washington decides to risk everything on one last desperately daring attack on the town of Trenton where over 1000 of the feared Hessian mercenaries are garrisoned. However to do that, the army must cross the Delaware to a seemingly hopeless battle that would turn out to be more successful than Washington ever dreamed of.
It's December of 1776. The American army under George Washington is a mere fragment of what it was in the summer, what with defeat after defeat at British hands, plus desertions and lack of supplies; and many troops had only enlisted until the year's end. The army escapes into Pennsylvania by seizing the only boats available, but the British will surely follow and wipe them out once the Delaware River freezes over. But then it turns out that the British are still in New York, Trenton (New Jersey) being held only by a smaller force of Hessian mercenaries. They're still tough, but maybe a Christmas attack across the river will catch them off-guard...
