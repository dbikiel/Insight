A solitary man without a shadow rises from his desk, dons his hat, and leaves his apartment. He walks through a city to a large door, knocks, shows his invitation, and is admitted to a colorful scene. He walks through drawing rooms and gardens. He speaks with a man in a top hat who offers him a life of romance, but in that life there is betrayal. Is there a place in the world for our man without a shadow?
