The son of a '70s rock star has to meet stringent conditions to inherit the family fortune, while his mates and greedy stepmother have other ideas.
Drug-filled and seemingly drug-fuelled tale of a rock star's son who has to meet certain conditions in order to receive his inheritance. Features a set of cameos from TV types, including Les Dennis and Phil Cornwell. If 18 year old Jason Mousely doesn't have a stable job, a steady girlfriend and respect his stepmother's property, he won't get the large inheritance of his late rock star dad. And we do indeed follow his misadventures as his life spirals out of control. He fancies a girl, is convinced to throw a party at his stepmother's house so he can chat her up, things go awry and you can guess the rest.
