Four guys break into an old castle and find uniforms and military equipment. They then prepare to defend it from an imaginary enemy.
A flute plays, while a voice intones a brief history of the outpost where there was once a WWII battle between the Germans and Russians. Four guys break into the old castle and find uniforms and other equipment to dress up in. When guns are found, one guy chases another around at the end of a bayonet; while another practices aiming at a bird. They clown around and feign challenging one another to a duel by slapping each other with gloves, until one guy gets annoyed. The serious 'soldier' barks orders and instigates marching exercises, belly crawling drills, bayoneting practice , examining their guns and generally preparing to defend the castle. They take a breather in the grass and upon locating a wine cask; have a few drinks. When a mouse is found, they taunt and chase it to it's death, before drinking more. Upon hearing machinery they reconnaissance, and discover farmers and their tractors. They rush to gird their defenses and set up a barricaded machine gun nest aimed toward the main gates. The tense waiting begins. One of them gets tried of the game and tries to disrobe and 'defect', so they tie him down to a wheelbarrow. But he's soon back in the fold and helping them build a fire and send smoke signals. Finally they are so bored, the 'commander' orders them to grab their guns and storm from the castle gates, into the unoccupied pastures. The actors are silent throughout and only the narrator is heard speaking. He discusses war and other topics, often laughing maniacally. He seems to be a different person than the one who tells the history in the intro. Other audio includes running water, wind, machinery, and radio communiques. The soundtrack involves a simple children's guitar, which plays a minor chord ditty early on, is plucked while they train and used to effect tension in the waiting scenes.
