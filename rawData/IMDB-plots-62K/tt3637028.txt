When the chaotically misfortunate Jenkins and the monotonously lucky Lou run into each other one morning, they find a thrilling and fulfilling change of pace as they hurtle down the hills of San Francisco in an ice cream cart.
Poor Jenkins, a demure and utterly unlucky young man, is somehow used to his persistent bad luck, while on the other hand, the bubbly Lou, a lively young woman, is preposterously favoured by a continuous touch of fortune. However, when the two opposites accidentally bump into each other (literally) in the slopes of San Francisco, as if by magic and a twist of fate, the bad days of jinx and misfortune will be a thing of the past.
