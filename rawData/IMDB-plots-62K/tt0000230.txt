A fairy godmother magically turns Cinderella's rags to a beautiful dress, and a pumpkin into a coach. Cinderella goes to the ball, where she meets the Prince - but will she remember to leave before the magic runs out?
This George Méliès' extraordinary fairy-tale film adaptation of author Charles Perrault's "Cendrillon", is considered to be the first film to use a dissolve transition in-between scenes. With the use of twenty masterly coloured engravings by Gustave Doré to illustrate the storyline's interchanging scenes, the director portrays Cinderella's well-known story, as the Fairy Godmother works her magic, transforming a poor and ragged girl to a fine aristocratic Lady at the King's Ball. In less than seven minutes, everything is here: from the magnificent magical carriage and the jealous sisters, to the noble Prince Charming and the dainty slipper. Of course, here too, time is of the essence.
