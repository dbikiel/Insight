An estranged brother and sister begin an intense sexual relationship, behind the curtain of their otherwise normal working-class lives.
After some years of tension, Richard begins a sexual relationship with his sister Natalie, who is now married. The relationship between Richard and Natalie proves dangerously obsessional. Their private intensity (&amp; working class origins) contrast with the middle-class, inhibited, stuffy public scenes we see in the Richmond world into which Natalie has moved with her marriage. As the guilt and intensity of the siblings increases we seem to be heading for disaster, especially when Natalie's husband Sinclair finds out.
