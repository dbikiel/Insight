Yegor Kremnyov, a Russian special intelligence agent, is tasked with bringing in Mikhail Shering, the secretary of a mobster, to testify.
Egor Kremnev is a special agent of the Russian intelligence, haunted by his recent failures in the military operations in Colombia, where his whole team was killed. Kremnev was blamed for the tragedy, and stripped of command. Now he is an ordinary agent assigned to seemingly boring surveillance jobs. But it looks like this his troubles are not over. During his last assignment, which promised to be simple and safe, the Colombian tragedy repeated itself - all of his fellow agents were neutralized by unknown foes.
