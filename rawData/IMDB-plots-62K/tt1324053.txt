Two weddings collide when both receptions are held at one hotel.
Dublin: Maura is a single mom, furniture repossessed, being evicted. For a fee, she's marrying Wilson, an African, facing deportation. Her nine-year old, Molly, thinks she's going to get a dad. Freddie, a bit of a compulsive, is remarrying Sophie, after divorce and recommitment; she's starved herself into her old wedding dress. Both bridal parties arrive at the same inn for receptions: Freddie and Maura's paths keep crossing, Sophie thinks the two are having an affair, immigration officers are stalking Wilson, and Molly's figuring out what's really up. Sophie's father threatens Freddie with bodily harm if anything goes wrong. Can it not?
