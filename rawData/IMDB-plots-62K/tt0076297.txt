An aging Sir Hector Geste (Trevor Howard) takes a young greedy wife who's after his famed Blue Water sapphire, but his sons hide the gem and join the French Foreign Legion in North Africa.
The priceless Blue Water sapphire is coveted by the heirs of Sir Hector Geste - his new wife, Flavia; his daughter, Isabel; and his adopted twin sons, heroic Beau and pathetic Digby. When Sir Hector takes to his deathbed (where he remains for the duration of the film), Beau absconds with the stone, to keep it from his stepmother. Flavia pursues him to North Africa, dispensing sexual favors to promote her schemes.
