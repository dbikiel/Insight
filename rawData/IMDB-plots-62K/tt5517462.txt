Small explosive monkeys stand guard over the order of the city.
The monkeys are again playing pranks in the Zoo, but suddenly they see two robbers breaking into a candy store. Threatening the seller with pistols, they collect different sweets in a large bag. Monkeys could not look indifferently and quietly climbed into their car. Mom in a panic hijacks a police motorcycle and rushes after them. Militiamen also start a chase.
