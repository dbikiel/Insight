A family is pushed to its limits when one of the daughters' lives is blighted by an eating disorder.
The Hunter family is dominated by endless, extreme dieting, due to mother's frustration over a fat-making upbringing by her parents. One daughter rebels to have a life as a nurse, but feels guilty. Then her perfect-considered sister, a workaholic law student, has to be interned for an eating disorder. After mother resists therapy, demanding her release home, a fatal incident occurs and the parents' marriage is wrecked. The surviving sister is consumed by guilty feelings, like the mother, and breaks up her relationship with a young doctor at the clinic, yet lets her grandfather set up dates with his buddy's grandson Charlie, a lawyer.
