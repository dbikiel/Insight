A woman and her childhood friend seek out revenge on those who victimized and abused them.
Anna rushes to help her friend Lucy, who was viciously abused as a young child, clean up the aftermath of the revenge she visited upon her abductors 15 years later. Was Lucy the only victim? Are they alone in this idyllic home? What nightmares lie beneath the tranquil facade of this house of horror? In search of the truth they uncover a sadistic cult organization determined to make a Martyr of each subject rather than a simple victim.
Imprisoned and brutalised as a child, young Lucie escapes from the nightmarish pit of torture where she was held captive, seeking solace in St. Mary's Orphanage, and an unexpected friendship with Anna, an equally tormented soul at the institution. One long and hard decade later--convinced that she has found her evil tormentors--a now-grown-up Lucie commits an unspeakable act of retribution with her shotgun, as Anna makes a harrowing discovery. Now, once more, both girls are forced to explore the shadowy realm of death, pushing the boundaries of suffering for an appallingly noble cause. Are they worthy of the ultimate secret?
