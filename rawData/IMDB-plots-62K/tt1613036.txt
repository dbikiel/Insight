Lost Airmen of Buchenwald is a feature-documentary chronicling the little-known story of Allied airmen imprisoned at the Buchenwald Concentration Camp in the final months of World War II. In the summer of 1944, 168 airmen from the US, England, Canada, Australia and New Zealand were sent by the German Gestapo from a prison in Paris to the infamous Koncentration Lager Buchenwald in Germany. Labeled "terrorists" by the Gestapo, they were sent there to be executed. A controversial moment in history that many western countries refused to admit ever happened, Lost Airmen of Buchenwald tells this harrowing story through interviews with seven surviving members of the group. The film follows them from their days hiding with the French Resistance to the darkest days of the Holocaust, as they struggled to survive inside Germany's most notorious camps as the country collapsed under the weight of the advancing Russian and Allied armies.
