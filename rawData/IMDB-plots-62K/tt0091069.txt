An Australian school teacher and her students are kidnapped. She and the children fight for their lives and try to escape from their captors.
"Fortress" explores a shocking concept which shows how easily a borderline between a victim and an attacker can be crossed. The children and the teacher, calm and peaceful by nature, when driven beyond their limits by the kidnappers, eventually respond with a cruelty and fury extending that of their oppressors.
Sally Jones (Rachel Ward), an Australian schoolteacher, finds herself in a fight for life--both her students and her own--when four armed, masked men burst into their isolated one-room school. The men round up Sally and her eight students, who range in age from six to fourteen, and force them into a van, claiming they are going to hold the school for ransom. At first Sally urges her students to comply, but she manages to help the children escape during a rest stop. They make their way to a farmhouse where an elderly couple (with no telephone) offers to hide them until the police can be contacted. But when their kidnappers track them down and murder their saviours, Sally knows that their chances of survival are slim.The kidnappers herd the school into a cave, sealing the entrance. Sally encourages the children to be brave and to organise themselves. Travelling further back into the cave, they find an exit and escape, only to find their armed kidnappers in pursuit and furious. The school isolates itself into a second, "fortress"-like cave at the top of a hill, where they must prepare for the coming night, when the kidnappers will reach them at last. Sally realises that the kidnappers will have to die, and also that she cannot defeat four grown men without help. The children will have to fight back in order to save their own lives, but Sally grapples with the idea that she must, in essence, give these children permission to commit murder.
