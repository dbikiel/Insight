An American Indian boy and girl sing and dance in the forest along with the animals. Trouble begins when a fire threatens baby birds in their nest.
As a tribe of Indians sings, the women are all falling for the three singers of the title, Bing Crosby, Russ Columbo, and Rudy Vallee. A brave brings a radio to his girlfriend, and she joins in the title song. The woodland animals join in, doing impersonations. While the tribe dances, a fire gets out of control. Three baby birds, trapped in a tree, are saved by a spider web used as a net.
