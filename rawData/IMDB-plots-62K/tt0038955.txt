Drama about the strong bond between a cowpoke and a wild bronco set during the 1940s.
Clint Barkley (MacMurray) first sees Smoky as a runaway, and drives him back to the ranch where he meets the owner, Julie Richards (Anne Baxter). He is given a job on her ranch, but the head cowhand is doubtful about Clint and fears that since he refuses to talk about himself, he must have some dreadful secret in his past. Clint and Smoky become close to each other, weathering the hardships of Western life and the suspicions of others together, until one day, Smoky tragically vanishes. Will Clint ever see him again?
Clint Barkley, a roving cowboy, spots a handsome black stallion as it defies a wild horse roundup. He captures the horsed, finds it responsive and trains and tames it. It even learns to step-out to music. The horse is stolen during a cattle-rustling raid, and Clint loses contact with it, but never stops searching for it. In the meantime the horse has been cruelly mistreated and acquired by a junk dealer to pull his junk wagon. During a rodeo parade, the horse steps out jauntily to the sound of the parade band music, and it is there that Clint finally finds him.
