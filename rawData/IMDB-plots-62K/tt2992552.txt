Tom Sizemore stars in the most explosive Behind Enemy Lines yet! Seal Team 8 must fight their way through the Congo to defuse one of the greatest threats the world has ever known.
While on an unsanctioned, covert mission in Africa, a small team of S.E.A.L.s uncovers intelligence pointing to the imminent sale of a massive quantity of weapons grade uranium. Now, with no mission prep and zero support, they have less than thirty six hours to fight their way past a ruthless warlord's army guarding this secret mining operation, hidden deep in the treacherous Congo, in order to secure the yellow-cake and expose the unknown buyer. One of America's greatest threats is about to obtain the final piece in becoming a true nuclear power and only Seal Team Eight can stop them.
