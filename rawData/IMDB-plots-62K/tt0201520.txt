Adventures of Cheburashka and Crocodile Gena continues.
The Crocodile Gena have a birthday. Cheburashka congratulates him and presents him with a gift. Further friends are engaged in the fact that they are trying to build a birdhouse, but they can not do anything. Next they build a playground and help the pioneers collect scrap metal. As a token of gratitude for the construction of the site and assistance in the collection of scrap metal, the link pioneer takes friends into the detachment and teaches them marching.
