A single magazine editor pretends to be married in order to avoid advances from male colleagues, but complications ensue when she meets a potential suitor.
Magazine editor Margot Merrick pretends to be married in order to avoid advances from male colleagues. Unfortunately, things don't go to plan when Jeff Thompson, a potential suitor, uncovers the deception and decides to show up at Margot's family home posing as her husband!
Margot Sherwood is a single magazine editor who wears a wedding ring and fabricates an absentee husband in order to both keep her job (her boss' jealous wife tends to fire single girls after a few weeks) and fend off advances from male colleagues. While going to visit a friend, Margot meets artist Jeff Thompson. Jeff catches on that Margot's "husband" is non-existent due to her inconsistent story of how they met. He decides to teach her a lesson...by showing up at her family home and announcing *he* is the husband. Margot is infuriated by Jeff's facade, but has to keep up with it so her own fib doesn't get out.
