Near Kawahara, a young man on a bus connives to meet a single mother by knocking over her son's box of crickets. He's Hiroshi, she's Haruka, the boy is Yuichiro. Hiroshi pursues Haruka, and she invites him into her flat. When Hiroshi is not engaged in exuberant sex with her, he's playing with Yuichiro and learning the intricacies of the neighborhood sport, cricket wrestling. The local cricket-raising champion is Anzai, who desires Haruka for himself. Haruka's ex-husband Taro and his girlfriend Kunico are also around - and everyone's paths will cross over desire, love, loneliness, and the quest for a victorious cricket.
