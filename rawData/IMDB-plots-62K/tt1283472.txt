A man is given a choice between salvation and damnation. What will he choose?
A man, at a first look held against his will, is given two simple options: push a black button which will kill someone, somewhere in the world, but also bring him ten million dollars, or just leave, but without the money. The situation turns out to be more than it initially seemed as his choices could bring him either salvation or damnation.
