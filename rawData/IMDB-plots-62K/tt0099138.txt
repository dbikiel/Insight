To impress a girl a shy teenaged boy buys a used Jaguar.
Danny wants two things in life more than anything else, one is a Jaguar and the other is Joanna Johnson. After Danny's parents give him their beloved Nissan Cedric, Danny works up the courage to ask Joanna out on a date.... One problem! He tells her that he owns a Jaguar, and to prove otherwise, he trades in the Cedric for an early model Jag. At the car yard he is conned into believing he is getting the deal of the century by the salesman, Gordon "Farkas".
Danny Clark loves Joanna Johnson and Jaguars. The only problem is he doesn't have either of them. Danny trades his ancient Nissan Cedric it for a Jag with crooked dealer Farkas, and a loan. The Jag has a dodgy motor and Danny is forced to try to steal the original motor from Farkas. Joanna hates cars but comes along for the ride anyway.
