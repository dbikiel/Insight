A paralyzed young woman becomes possessed by the Devil when a hypnosis session - intended to heal her disability - accidentally awakens memories of her past life as a witch.
Ippolita is a paralyzed young woman with serious mental problems stemming from the death of her mother. Her crisis of faith and the intervention of a well-meaning psychologist lead Ippolita to remember her past life as a witch during the Inquisition. Eventually, Ippolita becomes possessed and starts seducing local men, only to kill them. An exorcism seems to be the only solution to stop the madness.
