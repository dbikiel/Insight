A monk returns to his former life as a gunfighter when his estranged daughter is kidnapped by a Hungarian slaver.
Former gunfighter Django has become a monk and abandoned his violent former ways. His daughter is kidnapped by rogue Hungarian soldiers using slave labor to run a silver mine. Django casts off his habit and digs up his machine gun to practise a little liberation theology.
A woman comes to a monastery and tells Django, who became a monk many years ago, that he has a daughter in San Vicente that was kidnapped by the evil and cruel "El Diablo" Orlowsky, a former Hungarian soldier that uses his battleship to abduct men and boys to work as slaves in his silver mines and girls to be sold to brothels. Django follows his ship, but is captured and sent to labor work. He escapes with the support of the etymologist Professor Gunn and promises to return to rescues all the slaves. He goes to a cemetery where he digs his machine gun, preserved in a coffin buried under a tomb with the name "Django". He brings hell to Earth chasing Orlowsky and his gang.
