With two more weeks until Christmas, a busy business man, Marc Rehnquist, hires a struggling artist, Anna Parisi, to help him pick out gifts for his friends and family.
When Anna, an unemployed painter, is unable to make ends meet, she is hired to become a personal Christmas shopper for Marc, an uptight corporate exec. As they work together, Marc learns that Christmas giving has less to do with the amount of money spent and more to do with the importance of the gift, while Anna discovers she might find success as an artist in a way she never expected.
