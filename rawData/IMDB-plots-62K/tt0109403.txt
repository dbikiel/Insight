A hapless Navy grunt is assigned SP duty. The catch: he must escort a beautiful female prisoner on her way to prison for going UA. She in turn will try anything to escape.
Eddie Devane, a born charmer, has used his term in the US Navy, where he's every man's friend and every girl's darling, to set up a lucrative scam at Uncle Sam's expense, counting on the proceeds to pay for the Porsche of his dreams. On 4 July, his discharge day, he is however assigned for SP duty, escorting prisoner Toni Johnson with grumpy hard-ass sergeant Rock Reilly. That turns out to be a grueling job as she is clever and determined to escape, and Eddie soon succumbs to her female charms as in time even Rock may. And more surprises follow.
