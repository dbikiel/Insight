A boy in Budapest lost his father in 1945, when he was the age of six. He does not remember much of the father but fantasize that he performed various heroic feats.
Against the backdrop of post-WWII Hungary, the young orphaned boy, Takó, needs to create a loving fabrication for his long-lost father who died prematurely in Nazi-occupied Budapest. Having only faint and disappointingly few memories of his parent and hero--while still struggling to distinguish reality from fantasy--a grown-up Takó embarks on a journey of truth and enlightenment, as he attempts to unearth the identity of the beloved deceased he barely knew. Now, little by little, childhood's wide-eyed innocence gives way to the inescapable certainty. In the end, who was the man Takó called dad?
