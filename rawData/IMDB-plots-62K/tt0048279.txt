In eleventh century England, King Edward the Confessor wants Saxon Lord Leofric to marry a despised Norman woman, and has him jailed when he refuses. In jail, he meets Godiva, the Sheriff's daughter, and soon they are wed. The times are turbulent and Godiva proves to be a militant bride. Unrest between the Anglo-Saxon populace and the increasingly influential Norman French lead to her famous ride.
