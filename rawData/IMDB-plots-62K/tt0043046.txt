In 1876 Colorado, the Tomahawk and Western Railroad is expanding through the Rockies, but some stagecoach operators, fearing a loss of revenue, plan to sabotage the railroad.
In 1876, Dawson wants to prevent a train from getting to Tomahawk, Colorado on time, to keep it from competing with his stagecoach line. Kit, who must get the train to its goal, forces Johnny aboard as the needed passenger. Madame Adelaide's showgirls (including Marilyn as Clara) ride along and, en route to Tomahawk, join Johnny in "Oh, What a Forward Young Man You Are".
Johnny Behind-the-Deuces (Dan Dailey) is a travelling salesman in the 1870s who is surprised to find himself in the midst of a battle involving a small railroad company in Colorado. Kit Dodge, Jr. (Anne Baxter), the granddaughter of a U.S. Marshal, Kit Dodge (Will Wright), is backing Terence Sweeny (Walter Brennan) in his attempt to get his train through to Tomahawk to secure a government franchise. But a stagecoach company also wants the franchise and sends Dakota (Rory Calhoun) and his hired henchmen to stop the train, no matter the means employed to do so.
