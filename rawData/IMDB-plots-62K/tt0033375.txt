Rancher Tom Haggerty is killed trying to stop a gun battle between his hot-headed brother Red and the sheriff, who is trying to repossess Haggerty's ranch for defaulting on a bank loan. After Tom's son Steve learns of his father's death, he is reluctantly persuaded by his Uncle Red to help rob the local bank. While waiting to hit another bank in the next town, Steve becomes town marshal to get inside information on the town's dealings, but soon takes his job to heart when he falls in love with Ellen, the banker's daughter. His honor is put on the line when he must face not only the guns of the local saloon-keeper's gang, but the wrath of his uncle when he finds out his nephew has betrayed him.
