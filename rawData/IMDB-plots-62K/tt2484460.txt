Out of Print draws us into the topsy-turvy world of the written word, illuminating the turbulent, exciting journey from the book through the digital revolution. Writers, publishers, readers all in flux. Booksellers closing shop. Librarians and teachers seeking new roles. Storytellers like Ray Bradbury, complemented by evocative visuals, weave a compelling tale. Scott Turow and Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon as an online bookstore, place us in the middle of their debate. People tell us they read snippets all day long, yet one of five Americans no longer reads a single book, in any format, in an entire year. Personal stories of parents and students take us into their worlds, highlighting how this revolution is changing every aspect of the printed word -- and changing us.
