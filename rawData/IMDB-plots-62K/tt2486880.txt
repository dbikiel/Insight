A young gay couple discovers a secret room filled with cash while house-sitting for a rich couple who die while out of the country.
Married gay couple Alex and Richard love (covet) the upscale home of Jake and Chloe Jones, an affluent couple who operate a questionable charity for foreign orphans. Alex and Richard crash the Jones' house party just as the Jones's seek new house-sitters for their latest overseas trip. While the boys house-sit and discover a secret room with nearly a million dollars inside, word comes that the rich couple have died, leaving the house-sitters in a quandary over what to do next. Complicating the situation is Alex' half-sister Paige, who is married, pregnant, highly competitive against Alex, equally covetous of the house, ruthless, knowledgeable about there being a hidden fortune somewhere, and who, along with her husband Cooper, have been swindled by the Jones's and aggressively want what's due them.
