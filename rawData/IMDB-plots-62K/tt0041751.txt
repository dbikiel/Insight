A gopher sucks a flower into his hole, waking up Pluto. He chases the critter, but gets scolded by Minnie for digging up her flower bed. She pots the flower he dug up, and unknowingly includes the gopher in the pot, which she carries inside. The frustrated gopher digs under the rug, which wakes Pluto up again. This is his turf, and he manages to toy with the gopher for a while, until it climbs into a fireplace bellows. Pluto squirts it out, and between a soda bottle and guitar strings, it bounces off the walls for a while before shooting out the dog door game over, winner: gopher!
