The mummy of a cursed pharaoh and a reanimated corpse terrorize a medical university. Only an Egyptologist and a college professor, the deranged Dr. Frankenstein, may be able to stop the creatures before it's too late.
In New York, the professor of the medical university Dr. Victor Frankenstein is buying body parts from the janitor Carter to build a corpse and reanimate it. The Egyptologist Naihla Khalil, from the same university, has just returned from an expedition and brought the Mummy of Usekara, an evil and cruel pharaoh that was cursed, leaving his soul trapped in his mummified corpse. Victor and Naihla have a crush on each other and they date. Meanwhile Professor Walton, who is chief of department where Naihla works, accidentally releases Usekara's soul and is possessed by him. He kills his assistant Isaac and his blood awakes the Mummy. Then Walton lures his student Lenora and the Mummy eats her heart. Frankenstein's monster is reanimated and Victor is surprised with his capacity. But soon both monsters want Naihla: Frankenstein's creature to force Victor to transfer his brain to a new body and the Mummy believes she is the sorcerer that trapped his soul and wants Naihla to call off the spell. What will happen to Naihla?
