An indebted father regrets putting his teenage son in a coma over poor school grades and takes it out on the school system.
Children of India must have committed very grievous crimes in their previous lives to be subjected to ten years of rigorous school imprisonment. When you see the physical, mental, psychological and peer pressures put upon school-going children, all other punishments pale in its significance. Shrinivas Rane is an average student - not because of any lack of effort but because he was born with average academic intelligence - but a genius when it comes to cricket. His extraordinary talent is, however, lost on his father. Like millions of other parents, he believes a child's intellect is only reflected by their mark sheet, which eventually will give them a very "secure future." So starts the father's quest to make Shri the brightest and best student in the world - but Shri can't handle this pressure, and it reflects on his psyche. The relation between father and son deteriorates to a point where, in a fit of anger, the father does something which makes him afterward repent his actions. What is it that he does? Does the father-son relationship return to normal? Does Shri ever pick up a cricket bat? The answers lie in Shikshanacha Aaicha Gho.
Madhukar Rane is a single dad with two kids - Shrinivas and Durga. Shrinivas, while very bad at studies, is an aspiring cricketer; but, like other parents, Madhukar wants him to be bright in his mark sheet and not in sports. This creates a lot of tension between father and son. One day Madhukar shoves Shrinivas in anger, whereby Shrinivas hits his head and falls into a coma. Madhukar deeply repents his mistake - even to accuse the education system of putting too much pressure on today's youth - and tries all possible ways for Shrinivas to get treatment. Finally he gets a ray of hope when a foreign base doctor handles Shrinivas' case and assures him that he will be all right.
