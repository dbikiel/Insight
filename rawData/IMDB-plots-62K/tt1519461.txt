Three young conspiracy theorists attempt to uncover the mysteries of Area 51, the government's secret location rumored to have hosted encounters with alien beings. What they find at this hidden facility exposes unimaginable secrets.
Obsessed with breaking into the U.S. Air Force highly classified facility known only as Area 51, three young friends and zealous conspiracy theorists--Reid, Darrin and Ben--travel to Las Vegas. Equipped with state-of-the-art gear, they team up with Jelena, the daughter of the secret installation's former employee, and summon up the courage to sneak into the facility, intent on unearthing its otherworldly mysteries. There, in the bowels of the heavily guarded compound, terrifying truths and unfathomable knowledge await, and only the audacious UFO investigators' raw footage can prove their existence. However, can they make it back in one piece to share it with the world?
Two reporters, along with their respective photographer and filmographer, are invited to Area 51 by the Air Force, to try and dispel the rumors of top secret alien research. The attempt to mislead the public doesn't go at all as planned.
