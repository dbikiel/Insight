A calculating New York bookie hires a talented singer and dancer to entertain his nightclub. She brings her pet bloodhounds with her. This makes his girlfriend jealous, so she considers spilling the beans on his dealings to the feds.
"Numbers" Foster is a New York bookie with a special talent and a special problem. His talent (which Einstein recognized) is doing mathematical calculations rapidly in his head. His problem: he is currently under investigation for his book making activities and only his girlfriend Yvonne can get him out it. He flees to Florida while her testimony gets him off the hook. Driving back from Florida "Numbers" runs into Emily Stackerlee in Georgia and she saves his life. He feels she is in danger now because of it and since she has no family decides to take her to New York where she has always wanted to go. Her bloodhounds must come along, hence they become the "Bloodhounds of Broadway". Since she sings (and dances!) he decides to get her a job in a club but when Yvonne catches them kissing you can imagine the complications since a new investigation is just starting up. Now his problem is how to keep Yvonne quiet and still get to keep the girl he wants who is the first one to ever cause him to forget his numbers.
