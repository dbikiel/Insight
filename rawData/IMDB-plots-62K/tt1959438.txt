However, Djuna discloses to Paolo that she is a vampire and while making love, she turns him into one. Paolo moves to her house and they happily live together. Out of the blue, her wicked and troublemaker sister Mimi appears to stay for a week with them, turning their lives upside-down.
Story centers around two beautiful French vampire sisters who have separately come to stay at a summer estate -- a 'safe house' in Connecticut. Ventimiglia plays a screenwriter who begins a love affair with the "good" sister and insists on joining her among the undead. However, after they begin their life together, the other "bad" sister (Mesquida) shows up and begins wreaking havoc almost as soon as she arrives. Slowly, her dark presence threatens to destroy them all.
