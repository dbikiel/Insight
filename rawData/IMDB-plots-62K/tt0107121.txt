Einar and Bjørn leave Lene on the island for a fishing trip, when her former lover, Gaute, appears drunk and falls asleep in her bed.
Einar and Bjørn leave Lene on the island for a fishing trip. Then her former lover, Gaute, drops by unexpectedly. Drunk, he sleeps in the double bed. Lene sleeps on the couch and wakes up when the men come back. She tries to wake Gaute, but then discovers that he's dead.
Lene and Einar spend their holiday in a summer cottage on a small island at the coast. When Einar and the neighbor Bjørn go out with a fishing-boat on the sea, Lene has to stay alone in the cottage overnight. Suddenly her old lover Gaute turns up. He is seeking consolation after the loss of his next sweetheart. During the evening he drinks a lot of alcohol, although Lene warns him against this, knowing that he has a congenital heart-disease. In the morning she finds him naked and dead on a bed. She is seized by panic, and hides the corpse in the cellar. When her husband finally finds the dead body, he is seized with panic too. He thinks no one will believe that Gaute has died from natural causes, and that this story will end his career as a district judge. Einar and Lene try to get rid of the corpse, but problems arise.
