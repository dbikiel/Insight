Billy Carson discovers that "Drifter" Davis, an exact double, has been impersonating him in order to cover up a series of bank robberies.

Just about the time that Billy gets a lead that ties up Dirk Trent, the show's publicity man, with the bank robberies, Billy's pal, Fuzzy Jones, causes complications by helping Davis escape from jail, thinking he is the real Billy Carson.
