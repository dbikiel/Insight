A troubled 17-year-old struggles to adjust to life after rehab.
Locked away in a court-ordered drug rehab for six months, fragilely sober JJ White is finally back home, but with family and friends still financially stung from his drug-induced escapades, reactions are mixed and extreme over his return. Most crucial to his maintained recovery, however, is Aunt Dot's new $75,000 life insurance policy drawn up against JJ having a fatal relapse before his eighteenth birthday. With the temptation of money before them, wheels turn, loyalties shift, and clandestine alliances form to ensure that JJ and his new-found sobriety have a short lifespan.
