Pop's last request is for his sons to continue the family name. When his brother dies trying, Jeff leaves the seminary and encounters crazy women and odd ball characters.
The Lord moves in mysterious ways. Jeff has problems: his father is dying and wants either Jeff or Jeff's playboy brother Tom to sire a child before death's triumph; Jeff's mother constantly puts him down; he has strange dreams; and, he's a shy seminarian whose vocation is shaky. When it becomes impossible for Tom to fulfill dad's last request, Jeff leaves the seminary, gets a job as a drama coach at a home for aged actors, and sets about to please his father. He goes to bars to pick up women, seeks the help of an unconventional therapist, places an ad in the personals - and makes no progress. Meanwhile, he jokes around with a sweet co-worker named Cathy.
