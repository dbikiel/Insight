During WW2, British Major Valentine Moreland is tasked with rescuing a prized pedigree cow from the German-occupied Channel Island of Armorel.
At the outbreak of WWII the British realise they can't prevent the invasion of the Channel Islands. However, someone realises that a prize cow is on the islands and the Nazis mustn't get hold of her. This is the intrepid story of the cow-napping from under the noses of the Nazis.
The Germans invade the British-owned Channel island of Amorel on July 10, 1940, and though strategically unimportant, the occupation causes great consternation to the Ministry of Agriculture. The small island is the home of "Venus", a prize cow "with a pedigree as noble as the Kings of Ireland - a triumph of breeding." Plus, "Venus" is in calf - by "Mars of Mellowbury III", a champion bull - and the crossing of "Venus" and "Mars" is of enormous financial and breeding potential, horoscopes aside. The Ministry approaches the War Office, where "Venus" becomes the concern of the Armed Forces of the Crown. Major Valentine Moreland and his crew, A.T.S. Nicola Fallaize, radio operator Forbes and Trawler Langley, are assigned the task of quietly re-invading Amorel and bringing "Venus" to England. The simple plan of keeping the cow in hiding until a British destroyer arrives to pick her up is complicated when Commander Weiss, the German garrison commander, learns of the cow's value, and intends to send her to Germany in an E-Boat which is scheduled to be in the harbor the same day as the British ship.
