Based on a true story and memoir under the same name. With so many things going good in her life-great husband and friends, wonderful family, dream job-the last thing 27-year-old Geralyn Lucas expects is to be diagnosed with breast cancer. While having fear and doubts, Geralyn finds self-acceptance by relying on courage, humor, and her red lipstick.
Sitting in a strip club - the only woman there with her shirt on - Geralyn Lucas tries to blend in. She's come to make the biggest decision of her life - whether or not to get a mastectomy. Having recently graduated from journalism school and landed her dream job at "20/20," the last thing 27-year-old Geralyn expects to hear is a breast cancer diagnosis. Trying to find herself, while losing her vibrancy and her looks, Geralyn discovers a story of self-acceptance by relying on her courage, her humor and, of course, her red lipstick.
