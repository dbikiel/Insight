A sweet comedy about the world's greatest living porn director.
THE AUTEUR follows formerly renowned porn director Arturo Domingo (Five Easy Nieces, Requiem for a Wet Dream) through a bizarre weekend as he receives a lifetime achievement award at a film festival in Portland, OR. Encountering crazed fans, former collaborators, bitter enemies, and free-loving hippies, Arturo attempts to put the pieces of his broken career and personal life back together.
