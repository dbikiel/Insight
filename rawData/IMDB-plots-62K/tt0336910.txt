Two Irish lads stumble through London's gay scene.
The story of two lads from Belfast as they stumble their way through the London gay underworld in search of 'gainful employment'. This being the offering of sexual favors to older gay men in order to subsidize their respective giros. However, when one of the lads accidentally shags a punter to death, they are forced to look for 'work' elsewhere. It is then that they discover the myth of 'The Bread in the Bed' - a huge bed full of money. 'Nine Dead Gay Guys' is the result of the ensuing caper as the lads begin the search for the elusive bed.
