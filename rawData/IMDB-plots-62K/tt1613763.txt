Documentary filmmaker Mikkel Stolt has come to a stall in his career but eyes an opportunity for making a new ground-breaking film about the cyberspace universe called Second Life. He enrolls as Mike Pround (literally a translation of his actual Danish name) and with the help of amo. Rob Danton/Rob Gould and Helena Kirkorian, he tries to make a film inside Second Life. In his research, he also comes across Danny Hillis and The Long Now Foundation and is forced to ponder over the different realities in time and space. However, Mikkel is mostly infatuated with the belle Helena whom he pursues while his real-life wife, Helle, is waiting at home. Or is she?
