Stan fakes receiving a telegram so he can go to a club with Ollie and a bottle of his unsuspecting wife's liquor, but she overhears his plans.
Stan purloins his wife's secret bottle of liquor to have a wild night out at the Rainbow Club with Ollie. However Mrs Laurel has replaced the booze with a noxious mixture of cold tea, mustard power and other hot ingredients. This doesn't prevent the boys from getting tipsy on the contents!
On pins and needles waiting for his friend Ollie's phone call to organise a wild night out at the upscale Rainbow Club, Stan must first convince the vigilant and ever-present Mrs Laurel, and then concoct a daring plan, if he wants to get out of the tight spot. However, Stan's wife already knows all about their devious plot and immediately decides to retaliate with a complex and mischievous scheme of her own, involving a stolen bottle of liquor, and an imaginative recipe for destruction. Did Stan and Ollie truly think they could get away with their shenanigans so easily?
