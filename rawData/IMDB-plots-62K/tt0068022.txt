A man kidnaps the wife of a cavalry commander in order to exchange her for a Gatling gun that's being sold by a gun runner.
Joe Baker has a dream. He wants to do 'something big.' When he needs a Gatling gun to accomplish this, he seeks out a black marketeer. The price he wants for the gun? A woman! So Baker kidnaps a woman off of the stagecoach, only to find that she is the wife of the commandant of the local Cavalry detachment. Things get further complicated when a girl named Dover McBride shows up. She has come to force Baker to marry her and return east, as he promised to do four years earlier.
Intent on making it big--before his tough fianc√©e, Dover McBride, arrives from cold Pennsylvania--instead, the grizzled renegade, Joe Baker, finds himself back to square one and penniless. Still unsuccessful after four long years in the dusty New Mexico Territory, Joe knows that time is running up; however, in a desperate attempt to fulfil his aspiration, he summons up the strength for one last heist. As a result, one precarious agreement and yet another bad decision later, Baker has one more problem to deal with: the veteran U.S. Cavalry commander, Colonel Morgan. Under those circumstances, will Joe manage to pull off a surprise victory? Is he destined to do Something Big in his life?
