See You in September is an original romantic comedy set in current day Manhattan. The film centers around Lindsay, a beautiful woman who seemingly has it all, but is deeply afraid of commitment. When she finds out that her therapist takes a vacation for the entire month of August she feels shocked and abandoned. Instead of taking this news lying down, Lindsay enlists the help of her acerbic best friend Monica to come up with a solution. With the assistance of "Craig's List", Lindsay puts together a group therapy session for all Manhattanites who are in need of therapy, but more importantly angry at their therapists for abandoning them.
In New York City, every psychiatrist takes August off. Lindsey runs an ad in Craig's List and borrows her friend Monica's loft for a group therapy session for others whose docs are away. Counting Monica, there are 10 - a mixed bag - and their first session is complicated by a robbery. They cohere around offering support to each other - with field trips and interventions to their flats and jobs. The battle of the sexes underpins most of the interactions. For the month, the group assigns Lindsey, who's phobic about commitment, to date A.J., who has abandonment issues. Will there be breakthroughs? What do neurotics want?
