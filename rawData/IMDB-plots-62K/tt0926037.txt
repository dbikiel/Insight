Aurora dreams about becoming a talented ballet dancer one day. However, life is not so simple. 12-year-old orphan Aurora Nedelina lives in an orphanage in Pripyat and accidentally becomes a witness to the explosion at the Chernobyl APP. Having received a critical dose of radiation, she is sent to an American hospital where she meets the rich American Russian, Nick Astakhov--the world-famous dancer who had emigrated from the USSR 15 years prior. Nick is talented, successful, young, yet disappointed in life. Meeting up with Aurora helps Nick turn it all around. However, with each day, Aurora fades away a little more. Only something short of a miracle can save her.
