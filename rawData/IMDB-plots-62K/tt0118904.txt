Jailed on trumped-up charges in the Deep South, a woman receives unexpected aid from a fellow inmate.
Our heroine isn't having a good time. Having lost her L.A. job and walked out on her unfaithful boyfriend, she finds herself stuck in nowhere Macon County when her car and possessions are stolen by the girl hitch-hiker she picks up on her way to New York. Though innocent, she is thrown in jail for holding up a local store, then kills the sheriff's son when he rapes her. Now she's on the run with a convicted felon, but she still can't quite see that this really isn't her lucky week.
