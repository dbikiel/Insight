Based on a true story, and set in late 1990 against the backdrop of the first gulf war, An American in Texas is the story of lifelong friends as they reach the cusp of adulthood and must decide between the hollow values of corporate careerism; or the narrow way of individualism and freedom.
Lifelong friends and punk band, SGW (Surgeon General's Warning) look to bust out of small town Texas, as 1990 comes to a close. While the 24 hour newscasts market Operation Desert Storm and devotion to country at any cost, the band drops acid, plays gigs and carries out calculated acts of vandalism around town. Faced with the reality of a dead end job at the chemical plant, a life in the oil field or fighting a war that has no meaning to them they see their band as the one ticket out of town. As they plot their escape to Los Angeles, the boys find out what holds them together, could be the one thing that can tear them apart.
