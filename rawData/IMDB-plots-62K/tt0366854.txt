David, a student in Pisa who is about to pass his final exam, gets involved in an anti-globalist group.
David studies Natural Sciences at the University of Pisa and is about to pass his final exam. He plans to move to the United States to have further education there. But then he gets a flyer from a girl. It's Viola, who he met three years ago after a dinner with friends. He has thought about her ever since. Viola is a member of a beginning student anti-globalist group, called Mompracem after David's suggestion. They are preparing for a protest at the G8-summit in Genoa. While David tries to come closer to Viola, who is already in a relationship with group leader Luca, he gets more and more involved with Mompracem. So deep that the progress of his study might falter.
