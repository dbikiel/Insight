A young Church elder struggles with his faith when the married woman he has been seeing breaks off their relationship.
As the story begins, Malcolm is naked in the bed of a woman he's been visiting to try to convert her to his faith. She wants nothing to do with his Bible or his invitations to worship, and he can't stop himself from visiting her regularly and telling his walking partner, Paul, that he must see her one-on-one because she's shy. When she breaks off the affair, Malcolm pushes Paul away one last time and, in white shirt and tie, visits the house when her husband is home. Will Malcolm pull the house down?
