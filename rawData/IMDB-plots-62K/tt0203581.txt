A charming representation of the Mikado dance by three beautiful Japanese ladies in full costume. Very effective when colored. (from the Edison Catalog)
Three women perform a Japanese dance, suggested by "The Mikado". Dressed in elaborate costumes, the three appear side-by-side as they dance. The two dancers at each end wave banners, while the woman in the middle twirls a fan as she dances.
