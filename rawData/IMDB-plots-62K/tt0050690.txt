In Rome every year in August the wifes go on holiday on the seashore while their husbands stay at home to work. It is the period of the year most suitable to male unfaithfulness.

Mario, freshly married to Romana, falls deeply in love with Lionella and all his friends, Alberto, Fernando and Giacinto try to enjoy this time when they are single.
