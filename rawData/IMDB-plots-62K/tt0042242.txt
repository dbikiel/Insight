Prowl car cops on night duty romance a reluctant young lady while in danger from a vengeful racketeer.
Rocky and Dan, war buddies, are prowl car cops on night duty. Dan is a cynic who views all lawbreakers as scum; Rocky feels more lenient. Both are attracted to the radio voice of communicator Kate Mallory; but in person, Kate proves reluctant to get involved with men who just might stop a bullet. By lucky chance, Rocky and Dan cause big trouble for murderous racketeer Ritchie Garris; but when he swears vengeance, Kate's fears may prove justified.
Two big-city police officers, "Rocky" Barnes and Dan Purvis, war veterans and buddies, fall in love with the same girl, Kate Mallory, police secretary. She resists both, at first, but finally falls in love with Barnes. When he is killed the night before their wedding, by an escaped convict the two officers had captured, Ritchie Garris, Purvis carries on a personal vendetta to take vengeance.
