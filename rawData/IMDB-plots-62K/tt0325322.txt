Based on a factual case involving Diane Schaefer and Dr. Murray Brennan, a woman's claims of having had a relationship with a prominent doctor are completely denied by him.
In a Chicago jail cell, clever and charming Ellena Roberts recounts for attorney Sara Miller the details of a one-night stand that led to a heated love affair with prominent surgeon David Stillman. David's version of the facts differs entirely and he insists that he never slept with Ellena. Sure that the doctor is the one who's lying, Sara is preparing to defend her client in court when some disturbing facts emerge.
