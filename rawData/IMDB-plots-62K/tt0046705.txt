Nando Moriconi is a young Italian living in Rome. He is fond for everything coming from the United States. He tries to speak American-English, to wear clothes he thinks Americans wear, to walk like John Wayne, and to eat cornflakes with ketchup - His life is a parody of the real American way of life that he could not get. Nando's not-so-secret dream is to visit the USA, so he climbs up to the Coliseum and threats to commit suicide if the American Embassy does not give him the visa. But at this point Nando is very well known as a 'crazy-for-USA' boy and the troubles he provoked will not help him.
