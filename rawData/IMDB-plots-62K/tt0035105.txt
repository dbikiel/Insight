Sisters Ruth and Eileen Sherwood move from Ohio to New York in the hopes of building their careers. Ruth wants to get a job as a writer, while Eileen hopes to succeed on the stage.

The women also meet up with magazine editor Bob Baker, who takes a personal interest in helping both with their career plans.
