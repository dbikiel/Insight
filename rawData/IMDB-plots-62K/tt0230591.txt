The Palestinian terrorist group Black September holds Israeli athletes hostage at the 1972 Summer Olympic Games in Munich.
The 1972 Munich Olympics were interrupted by Palestinian terrorists taking Israeli athletes hostage. Besides footage taken at the time, we see interviews with the surviving terrorist, Jamal Al Gashey, and various officials detailing exactly how the police, lacking an anti-terrorist squad and turning down help from the Israelis, botched the operation.
"One Day in September" is a new kind of thriller - one where real lives are at stake and every event is true. They were billed as the "Olympics of Peace and Joy" but became the Olympics of terror. In 1972, an extreme Palestinian group called Black September held 11 Israeli athletes hostage in the Olympic village in Munich, while the world looked on, incredulous.
