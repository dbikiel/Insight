White little bear smokes a pipe in the radio room while his mother is looking for him.
Once having met among the snow-covered expanses of the North Pole, the boy and the white bear were tightly friends. Soon, a new friend of Umka flew away in a helicopter in an unknown direction, and the bear cub began to search for him. However, in the nearest vicinity, where his mother let him walk alone, he only meets seals. Umka, bored in the separation of a friend goes to look for him.
