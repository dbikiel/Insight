The daily life of an hospital through the eyes of new intern Benjamin.
Benjamin is going to become a great doctor, he is sure of it. But his first experience as junior doctor in his father's service, the Professor Barois, does not turn out the way he hoped it would. Benjamin will be brutally confronted with his own limits, his fears, those of his patients, families, doctors and the staff.
