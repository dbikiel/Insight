In Africa, 2 expat "brothers" are usually at each other's throats but now have a common enemy. Ormond's men are shooting or catching much of the wildlife for export as well as forcing the locals off their land. Lots of fun fights follow.
In Africa, many years ago, Slim and Tom don't like it when a German tyrant, starts selling all of the African wildlife to Canadian Zoo's! Slim and Tom must teach this guy a lesson by beating the hell out of him and his gang, left and right!
