A look at the life of legendary American pilot Amelia Earhart, who disappeared while flying over the Pacific Ocean in 1937 in an attempt to make a flight around the world.
Amelia Earhart, a Kansas girl, discovers the thrill of aviation at age 23, and within 12 years has progressed to winning the Distinguished Flying Cross for being the first woman to pilot a plane solo across the Atlantic Ocean. At age 39, she sets out on an attempt to circumnavigate the globe, an adventure that catapults her into aviation myth.
The final nine years in the life of Kansas-born aviatrix Amelia Earhart (1897-1937) is presented. This phase of her flying career included publisher George Putnam recruiting her to be the first woman to fly across the Atlantic albeit solely as "commander" i.e. as a passenger, her want truly to be in her mind the first woman to fly across the Atlantic by doing it solo despite several others perishing in the attempt before and after the only successful solo flight to date by Charles A. Lindbergh, and the two attempts to circumnavigate the globe, the final attempt which would lead to her presumed death as her plane was never found. What was often seen as her reckless flying decisions to those around her are also demonstrated. Interspersed with these flying landmarks are her need to raise money to finance her flights by writing books, doing endorsements and making public appearances, all which she abhorred. Her relationships with several people are also presented, including with: Putnam, who was also her manager and eventual husband; fellow aviator Gene Vidal, with who she had a love affair known to George; Fred Noonan, her celestial navigator for the two global flights, his skill as such which was balanced by his excessive drinking; and young Elinor Smith, with who she had a love/hate relationship solely because Smith aspired to take her place as the world's premier aviatrix.
