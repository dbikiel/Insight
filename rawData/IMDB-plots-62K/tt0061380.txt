A widow stirs things up in a western town by raising sheep instead of cattle, and organizing the local women to demonstrate for women's suffrage.
Josie Minick is a widow, who is forced to fend for herself. Josie living in a cattle country, finds herself in odds and war with the cattlemen of the town, when she decides to make a sheep farm her livelihood.
In the Wyoming Territory, Josie Minick has just been widowed. Despite most people, including Josie herself, believing her now deceased husband Whit Minick to be a mean and not nice man, some still believe Josie killed him. Regardless, Josie's primary concern is taking care of her adolescent son, Luther Minick. Currently, his paternal grandfather, Cheyenne based Alpheus Minick, has taken custody of Luther against Josie's wishes since he feels she can't take care of him in her current situation. Although Josie has many friends and supporters, most specifically Jase Meredith, all of the men, including Jase, believe Josie, as a woman, should only be able to do what is traditionally seen as women's work, which is usually positions of subservience and drudgery. What Josie would really like to do is to move back to a large farmstead she and Whit jointly owned, but which has been neglected, to raise cattle. Unwittingly, Jase gives her an idea of how to make a living in doing something she sees as manageable, but which is against the unofficial code of the territory. Despite the range war that ensues largely led by Josie's neighbor Arch Ogden, Josie is determined to win on her own terms, all in an effort to be with Luther again. But Josie also unwittingly may get some of her closest friends killed, while jeopardizing Jase, Arch and the other political leaders' of the territory's want for Wyoming to become the forty-fourth state in the union.
