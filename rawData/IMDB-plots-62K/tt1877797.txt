A couple endures a series of mishaps right before their wedding day.
Soulmates Alexandra (Talulah Riley) and Jeremy (Matthew McNulty) are getting married. At least that's the plan. Unfortunately for them, nonchalant best man Peter (Noel Clarke), bridesmaid Sarah (Mena Suvari) and an army of naysayers haven't heard they're meant to be together. Can missing bridesmaids, crashed cars, a trip to A&amp;E, and a delivery of pigs testicles stand in the way of true love?
