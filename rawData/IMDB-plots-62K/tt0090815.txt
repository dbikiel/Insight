Stan, screeplay writer, had his time of glory in Hollywood. Today, alcoholic with a certain envy for suicide, his only link to life is his daughter, Charlotte.
Once a successful Hollywood screenwriter, Stan is now a depressive alcoholic who spends most of his time mooching about his house whilst pouring out his troubles to his drinking partner. The only thing that keeps him going is his love for his teenage daughter Charlotte, but she despises him, believing him to be responsible for the accident in which her mother died. Stan's one hope is to patch things up with his daughter, but will she ever forgive him...?
