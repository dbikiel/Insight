This is a Bromantic Comedy about two struggling writers who peddle their mediocre screenplay, "Sulemani Keeda" in Bollywood. Perenially hungry and horny, they lie, drink, hit on unsuspecting girls in bookshops and attend poetry readings where they read their vulgar verses. Things look bright when they meet a wannabe auteur, Gonzo Kapoor who wants to make a film inspired by Tarkovski. Gonzo gives them three days to come up with a great idea. When one of them falls in love with a bohemian photographer who is leaving India in three days, he is faced with a choice- whether to co-write a film he doesn't believe in or woo the girl he has fallen in love with.
Dulal, a brooding intellectual and his hustler friend Mainak dream to write a big Bollywood film. Their picaresque journey brings them in a position where they have to choose between friendship, love and the chance of a big break. The film delves into the world of young migrant writers, their hopes and their ontological anxiety.
