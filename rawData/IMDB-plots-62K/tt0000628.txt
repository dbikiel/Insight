On a warm and sunny summer's day, a mother and father take their young daughter Dollie on a riverside outing. A gypsy basket peddler happens along, and is angered when the mother refuses to buy his wares. He attacks mother and daughter but is driven off by the father. Later the gypsy sneaks back and kidnaps the girl. A rescue party is organized but the gypsy conceals the child in a 30 gallon barrel which he precariously places on the tail of the wagon. He and his gypsy-wife make their getaway by fording the river with the wagon. The barrel, with Dollie still inside, breaks free, tumbling into into the river; it starts floating toward the peril of a nearby waterfall . . .
A father and a mother bring their daughter Dolly for a walk. A gypsy violently reacts to the refused to buy something from him. The father defends the family and the gypsy, in revenge, kidnaps Dollye, who is put into a barrel, which falls into the river that flows towards the waterfall. The parents find the barrel and the child on the river side.
