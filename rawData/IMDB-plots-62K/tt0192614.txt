At that moment, Caleb is just leaving the police stating, having told the police that Lucas killed Will and covered it up.

Lucas refuses "the honour", realizing he was used by the Senator and states he will risk the consequences of leaving the society behind him.Lucas leaves the island and meets back up with Chole, walking off together.
