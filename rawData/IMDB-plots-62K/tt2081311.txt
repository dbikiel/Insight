Baz is one of Britain's new bicycle police, a figure of fun.Â But soon he will turn from cycle cop to psycho-path.Â As riots break out in London, a head injury skews Baz into a vigilante, offering criminals the choice of arrest or death. Baz sees his campaign as lawful killing. Lowlifes who are too stunned, confused, or drunk to argue when he politely asks, "May I kill you?" are merrily dispatched. All filmed on the helmet-cam and posted on social networks!Â Using the alter ego @N4cethelaw, Baz acquires thousands more fans with each killing, dispensing justice to scumbags, cleaning up society. In a sudden reversal, Baz is captured by an enraged relative of one of his presumed "kills", and faces slaughter or -Â even worse - exposure.
