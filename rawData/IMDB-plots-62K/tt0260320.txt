A scientist and his sidekick accidentally clone a journalist and decide to turn the mistake into Repli-Kate, their idea of the perfect woman, who loves, beer, football and frat parties.
A teenage scientist/lab technician named Max Fleming has just met the woman of his dreams -- beautiful, smart and sexy magazine reporter Kate Carson, who is trying to gain some scientific information from Max for an article she's working on about the lab where Max works. Unfortunately, a science geek like Max isn't Kate's type. One day, during an experiment, Max accidentally clones Kate. With the help of his buddy, Henry, Max takes advantage of the situation and transforms his Repli-Kate into a more mature and masculine-centered type of person -- a perfect mate. But when Max's maniacal boss, Dr. Jonas, has the real Kate return to finish her story on the genetic lab, Max is thrilled. Soon, Max realizes that the real Kate represents true perfection and love rather than the over-the-top Repli-Kate. Soon, the real Kate begins to fall for Max too, until she discovers Max's little secret.
