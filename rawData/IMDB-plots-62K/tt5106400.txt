A new romantic comedy feature film that brings together three interrelated tales of gay men seeking family, love and sex during the holiday season.
SHARED ROOMS explores the meaning of home and family through three interrelated stories of gay men finding connections during the week between Christmas and New Year's Day - a married couple who take in a teenage relative who was kicked out of his home after his parents discovered he was gay; a pair of roommates forced to share a bed for the week, much to the delight (and horror) of the one harboring a secret crush on the other; and two men looking for a quick hookup who end up finding a much stronger connection.
