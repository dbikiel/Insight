Manolo is a private detective specializing in adultery cases and working in a beach-and-tourist ghetto of San Juan, Puerto Rico. He appears to live tortured by the murder of his twin-brother Frank --which event took place just a few years before and for which he was formally accused. Then, following his motto of "betrayal is my business", Manolo spies on and records the affair of past friends Migdalia and Carlos --a case he scores by calling Migdalia's Mother and getting her to hire him-- while, in a parallel tangent, he attempts to mentally reconstruct the events that culminated in Frank's murder.
Manolo (Pedro Capo) is a private detective specializing in adultery cases, work he considers "dirty, difficult and underpaid" and which he practices under his motto of "betrayal is my business." His center of operations is the beach-and-tourist ghetto of Costa Azul, in San Juan, Puerto Rico -a sector constantly overtaken by "players and ravers"-- where he lives in a guesthouse known as "El Hospitalillo". There he surrounds himself with a makeshift community of marginal characters which include, among others, his door-to-door neighbor, Nadja (Aris Mejias), a graphic artist surviving as clothing-store clerk; Tony Puma (Modesto Lacen), a bipolar soldier who never got to Iraq because he slept with the Sargent's wife; dance teacher and would-be fantasy woman Aurora (Ana Isabelle); their landlord, Pedrin (Chente Ydrach), known as 'the philosopher of love'; Manolo's occasional assistant, Richard (Dave Buchen), known as "el gringo", a consistent party animal; the group's so-called 'pharmacist', Jose (Leonardo Castro), and his well-stocked 'medicine cabinet'; and Rafo (Xavier Cruz), a part-time gigolo and veteran who did serve in Iraq. Manolo appears to live tortured by the murder of his twin-brother Frank (Pedro Capo), a veteran of five tours of Irak -which took place just a few years before and for which he was held responsible and formally accused. The film narrates Manolo's work spying on and recording the affair of past friends Migdalia (Laura Aleman) and Carlos (Xavier Torres) --a case Manolo scores by calling Migdalia's Mother (Cordelia Gonzalez) and getting her to hire him-- as well as, in a parallel tangent, Manolo's efforts to mentally reconstruct the events that culminated in Frank's murder.
