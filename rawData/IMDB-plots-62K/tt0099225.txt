A mysterious woman claiming to be the deceased daughter of a rich man tries to solve the problems of his untrusting son and supposedly mentally handicaped daughter. But one question stands in her way: is she really Caroline?
A woman named Caroline reappears after a 14-year absence, during which time she was thought to have died in a plane crash. Claiming to be the daughter of wealthy Paul Carmichael from his first marriage, she explains that she didn't board the plane, and had used the chance to flee her shallow debutante lifestyle. Paul's new wife, Grace, is deeply suspicious of the woman's story -- especially since Caroline stands to inherit a fortune.
Set in the 1950's, a woman (Zimbalist) appears 14 years after supposedly dying in a plane crash. She claims she never boarded the plane and simply used the crash as a means to escape her debutante life. Now she is ready to rejoin the rest of the family, except everyone is skeptical particularly as she has shown up just in time to inherit a fortune from a recently deceased grandmother (Dorothy McGuire shown in flashbacks). Contains nothing that would be offensive to anyone, but is probably too adult in theme for small children.
