THE TOY GUN is a funny dark comedy about a character who looks to show the world the despair his ex-wife has left him in through a poorly thought out gesture, only to find himself worthy to move on thanks to the advice of his reformed ex-con neighbor and his newfound, albeit stolen, cash injection.
Set in what could be the same universe of Fargo and The Big Lebowski, THE TOY GUN is a fun-yet-gritty dark comedy about a meek young man who impulsively robs a bank to prove to his ex-wife that he is courageous and masculine. A police investigation engulfs everyone except our unassuming hero, who is, ironically, completely ignored.
