In the middle of Nowheresville lives 16-year-old Mike who wants out of his crappy life - permanently! Spending his time devising ways to do himself in, he considers the fatal brain tumor in his head as a godsend. That changes when he meets a girl and falls in love for the first time - without even knowing what love is.
Schoolboy Mike Burger (16) finds life with his nagging bitchy mother Cynthia Tyson in Faintville, a backward lumberjack town in thee Canadian forest where he has father nor friends, unbearable. Even his suicide attempt by head-shot only lands him in hospital, but he puzzles the staff by welcoming a major brain tumor which he refuses to have treated, even after his presumed biological father, Frank Burger, is finally brought in. Having deliberately antagonized everybody and resolved to run away and die, Mike meets and soon falls in love with softer, compassionate fellow maverick Miranda, who drives him on their fugue deep into the forest, but as they bond, fate has another cruel twist in store.
