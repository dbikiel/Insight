When a guzzled prospector stumbles on the treasure of gold coins hidden by Mexican emperor Santa Ana, a myriad of malefactors, both outlaws and outwardly upstanding citizens resort to subterfuge and murder to obtain it.
Charles Starrett makes his final appearance as The Durango Kid, this time as Steve Reynolds, a postal inspector who has gone underground to catch the bad guys. His longtime sidekick, Smiley Burnette appears as an itinerant optometrist who is hardly in the plot line of the film. Jock Mahoney plays Jack Mahoney, an eastern educated dude who has come back home. The Durango Kid teaches Jack how to draw and fire a six-gun, and the two ultimately work together to bring the outlaws to justice. Evidently, the director, Fred f. Sears, and the cast had made this picture so many times they could not invent a new ending. At the end Smiley addresses the audience directly and assures us that everything turned out all right. He is puzzled, however, why Steve never got to meet The Durango Kid.
