A former cop who now earns a wage as a crime scene cleaner unknowingly participates in a cover-up at his latest job.
Tom Cutler, a retired police officer now runs a company which specialises in crime scene clean up. He is assigned a clean up job post a homicide. After doing the job he discovers that he has been conned into cleaning up a crime scene and must try to unravel the mystery behind what happened in that house.
Widower, single father and former cop Tom Carver (Samuel L. Jackson) now has an unusually gruesome vocation -- having to immaculately clean up even the grossest and abjectly gory of crime scenes, purposefully leaving the area so spotless that those next to occupy the premises would never have a clue of there being even the slightest thing amiss. But when he's called in to sterilize one particular wealthy suburban residence following a brutal shooting, Carver is deeply shocked to learn that his meticulous skills may not only have erased crucial undocumented evidence, but might have dangerously entangled himself in a dirty and far-reaching cover up, as well. Directed by Renny Harlin and co-starring Eva Mendes, Ed Harris, Keke Palmer, and Luis Guzman, Cleaner is a dark, gritty and suspenseful crime thriller that proves that the grim task of simply cleaning up gore can be the one of the dirtiest jobs there is.
