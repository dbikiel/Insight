24 Frames is an experimental project made by filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami in the last three years of his life. It is a collection of 24 short four-and-a-half minute films inspired by still images, including paintings and photographs.
What happens in the moments before and after a photograph is taken? 24 Frames answers this question and unites the two artistic languages Kiarostami dedicated his life to. Melancholic and joyous, serious and mischievous, it's a refined meditation on the passage of time and on the fragility of existence - themes central to the cinema of this revered Iranian director.
