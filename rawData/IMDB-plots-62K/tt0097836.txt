A group of women send their husbands and children to the island of Ré and stay in Paris to spend the month of August. During this time children try to become adults and their parents find themselves behaving like children. This separation allows the women consider their lives, and succeed at best to be happy while men are happy, like kids, organize a life of band. Behind the visible euphoria, however, the problems arise: Martin (Jean-François Stévenin) would like to comfort his son Clément (Clément Thomas) with his imaginary love deprivation by pushing him into the arms of Annette (Catherine Bidaut), the babysitter of Michel's (Pierre Jean) children. But he himself falls for her charm while Clément is seduced by Jacqueline (Anne Guinou), Georges's wife. Bruno (Guy Marchand) was abandoned by his wife and then let himself be knocked by a nymphomaniac widow. And then there is the little Eléonore (Vanessa Guedj), who is in love with Clément, and she attempts suicide after a quarrel with him.
