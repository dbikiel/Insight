At the tender age of 70 she started recording and releasing her own music straight from the living room. 7 years later she had 59 albums to her name with more than 600 songs - an eccentric myriad of catchy compositions mixing in her pets, found toys, kitchen percussion and Casio keyboards. Sigridur Nielsdottir is her name, and before long the Icelandic/Danish musician became an adored cult figure in the Icelandic music scene, represented here by her young apprentices Mugison, Mum, and Seabear. Shot mostly on Super-8 and 16mm 'Grandma Lo-fi' is a cinematic tribute to her boundless creativity.
