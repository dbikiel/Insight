Kati, Jochen and Lukas take a trip on magic mushrooms. Lukas is not coming back.
Driving through the countryside, Kati, Jochen and Lukas take some magic mushrooms. One of them, Lukas, is not coming down from them. Hearing voices like multiple different low turned radio programs, changing and mixing altogether. The diagnosis of the physician: paranoid schizophrenia. Not able to filter and interpret the sensations presented he encounters fear, inner voices, paranoia and is drifting away from reality.
Lukas is joining his sister Kati and her boyfriend Jochen in her flat in Cologne for starting his grown up life. After taking magic mushrooms together in the nature, schizophrenia is triggered at Lukas. An inside look on the subject of mental illness and its concomitants.
