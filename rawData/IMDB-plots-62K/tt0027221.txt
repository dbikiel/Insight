In his dedicated pursuit of technology that will aid pilots to safely "fly blind" during adverse conditions, aerial innovator Ken Gordon is literally blinded in an accident, but this setback doesn't deter him from his goal.
Aeronautical engineer Ken Gordon and his faithful mechanic Mac are devoted to developing technology that will enable pilots to safely fly blind during adverse weather conditions. An irresponsible newsman, Nick Williams, publishes a premature story about a planned long distance flight Gordon hopes will prove his theories. Because of Williams, he loses funding but is introduced to skilled aviatrix Shiela Mason. After Gordon is literally blinded in a workshop accident, Shiela undertakes dangerous stunt flying jobs in order to secretly support Gordon's continuing research. When she undertakes a dangerous Moscow to New York non-stop flight and is in jeopardy of crashing over a fog-bound Roosevelt Field, there is only one person capable of saving her.
