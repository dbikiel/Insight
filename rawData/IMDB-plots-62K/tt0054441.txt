Three old chums who are number ones in the business of practical jokes decide to leave their village from Vend√©e in France in order to go and live in a old people's nursing home. Pested off and unable to stand their jokes any more, the villagers are more than happy to see them leaving off. But the three old men, soon enough, feeling bored of the nursing home, make up their mind to come back and settle down in the village.
