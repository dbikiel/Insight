Sixteen years after the presumed deaths of the two boy princes held captive in the Tower, Perkin Warbeck makes his claim to the throne as the rightful King Richard. Did the younger brother survive? Is he an impostor? Or is he, as he says, King Richard?
A dramatised account of one of the possible theories surrounding a man who, in the late 1400s, claimed to be heir to the throne and brother of then-queen Elizabeth. But is this man an impostor to dethrone Henry VII, or is there truth to his claim that he didn't die 16 years before and has returned to take the throne?
