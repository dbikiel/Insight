Fed up with the inhumane prison living conditions, a general prison riot breaks out, leading to hostage-taking, a stand-off with the guards and eventual negotiations with the prison administration officials.
Producer, Walter Wanger, who'd just did time (4 mos. after shooting a man he believed was having an affair with his wife), wanted to make a film which showed the appalling conditions he saw whilat incarcerated. Working with Don Siegel, they wrote this film. In protest to the brutal guards, substandard food, overcrowding and poor living conditions, inmates stage an uprising, and take several guards hostage. Negotiations between the inmates and prison officials are stymied, by politicians interfering with the prison administration, and by dissension and infighting amongst the inmates.
