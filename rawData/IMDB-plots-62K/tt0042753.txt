A golf-crazy songwriter tries to avoid the long, solitary hours of concentration needed to produce a hit musical. His producer and his secretary conspire to get him back on track.
Paul Merrick, a writer of hit musicals, prefers to lie in the sun or play golf. He does so until he goes broke and asks to borrow a large sum of money, against future earnings, from his producer, Alex Conway. They are invited to a university, Paul's alma mater, to see a college production that is using some of Paul's music, and meet Katherine Holbrook, a student. Alex makes out the loan-money check to Katherine and hires her as Paul's secretary with instructions to give him only so much money per week after he starts to work on a new show. Complications arise when Paul meets Lorna Marvis, a society woman whose company is more expensive than the allowance Katherine is doling out to him.
