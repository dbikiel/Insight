Friends go inspect an old house. They find a grave of a woman in the front yard. One of them smashes the headstone and awakens her vengeance. The dead come alive and the living can't escape as the house locks down to keep them in, forever.
Eight friends go to fix up an old house that Mark has purchased. Upon arriving they find the grave of Annabelle (the former owner) in the back yard. She had killed her husband back in the 40's. Bob (one of Mark's friends) smashes the headstone and awakens Annabelle, this begins the carnage. But the dead don't stay dead and the living can't escape as the house locks down to keep them in.
A group of semi-hip yuppies, friends who constantly bicker, begin the task of fixing up an old house for them to live and party in. They soon uncover the dark secrets of the old woman who used to live in the house... and then they meet her! The elderly lady seems frail and senile, but soon proves to be strong and quick as she begins killing off the friends one by one. The house itself is haunted, and it prevents them from leaving. To make matters worse, the recently murdered kids rise from the dead within minutes of being killed, as wise-cracking zombies intent on helping the old lady kill every living person in her house.
