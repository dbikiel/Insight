Based on the life and times of NAACP field secretary and Mississippi civil rights leader Medgar Evers, assassinated in 1963.
This movie traces the life of Medgar Evers, the former insurance salesman turned field secretary for the NAACP, who was instrumental in organizing boycotts against discriminating southern white merchants and the desegregation of the University of Mississippi. Although Evers truly believed that the Constitution included the rights within for each American citizen, no matter what color or class, his battle for equality would shockingly conclude with his assassination at the hand of white supremacist Byron De La Beckwith on June 12, 1963.
