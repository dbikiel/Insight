In a small town, a brewing romantic rivalry with a local tough and a school-teacher culminates in a terrifying ride in the night.
In a small town named Sleepy Hollow, a gangly schoolteacher named Icabod Crane comes to town. Despite his unattractive appearance, he quickly proves to be a ladies man who charms the local beauty, much to the local tough, Brom Bones', displeasure. A subtle rivalry erupts, only to have Crane continually gaining the upper hand. The situation changes when Brom learns of Crane's superstitions and exploits them as he musically tells the legend of the fearsome Headless Horseman to frighten the teacher. That night, Crane's lonely night ride home becomes more lively than he ever imagined as the Horseman appears to chase him.
Irving's classic tale is now told through the animated Disney feature. Ichabod Crane comes to Sleepy Hollow to fill in as a pedagogue in the town. While there, his heart beats when he sees the beautiful Katrina Van Tassel whom is the flirtatious village beauty. Brom Bones however, the village hero, is not about to let Ichabod take his Katrina, so he attempts to stop the pedagogue at all costs- even if he has to twist the ghostly story of the Headless Horseman to his advantage.
