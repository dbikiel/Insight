When Eva opens her eyes the young girl finds herself chained terrified for being abused. Her fears become reality in a way no one could ever imagine.
Confident college girl Eva (Carolien Spoor) is looking at apartments to rent when she finds the perfect place in a block near the university where she studies. Dividing her time between study to become an actress and a vet, the low rent flat is perfect for her and the cute neighbor opposite more than makes up for the creepy landlord and the spying old man that she spots through the window. However, her life takes an awful turn when she awakens in a dungeon cell chained to a bed with a camera watching her every move. She is a prisoner and her captor has a dark and disturbing plan for her that she may not survive.
