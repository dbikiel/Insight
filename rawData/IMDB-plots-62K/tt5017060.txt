Maigret plunges into the murky Parisian underworld.
A series of vicious, murderous attacks on three wealthy farms in Picardy hit the national headlines and the elite Brigade Criminelle at the Quay Des Orfevres is called upon to lend its expertise in tracking down the brutal gang responsible for the slaughter. However, Inspector Maigret is resolute in investigating the murder of an obscure anonymous Parisian, an investigation that ultimately solves both crimes.
Maigret's officers are called upon to assist in the case of three vicious murders at farm houses in Picardy but Maigret is intrigued when a man phoning him to say he fears he is about to be killed and calling himself only 'Nina's husband' is indeed found slain. A witness appeal identifies him as café owner Albert Rochain, whose killers seemed to be looking for something and by reopening the café Maigret attracts a suspect, Victor Poliensky, and can identify his accomplices, apparently connecting Albert to the Picardy killers. This is confirmed when a female gang member survives an attack by another of the killers, shot dead by Maigret. Ultimately a news paper advert results in a friend of Albert linking him to a gang of race course fixers, which in turn leads to the identity of the leader of the Picardy murderers, and the closure of the case.
