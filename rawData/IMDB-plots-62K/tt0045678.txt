Paul Lartal of the Foreign Legion meets the princess of a lost city in the Algerian mountains.
Paul Lartal leads a troop of legionnaires into ambush at the hands of Omar Ben Calif. Returning later at the request of Princess Morjana he is led to the hidden city of Madara, currently harrassed by the evil Crito. Lartal must do in the bad guys (which includes participating in a bare chested spear-throwing contest), save the city and comfort the Princess.
Captain Paul Lartal of the Foreign Legion, seeking guerilla Omar Ben Khalif in remote Algerian mountains, is sole survivor of an ambush. His superiors don't believe his tale of being rescued by a lovely, mysterious princess. But later, said princess invites Paul back to the hidden city of Medara, which, it seems, is threatened from within by a demagogue, Crito. Paul can only prevent a takeover by marrying the adorable Morjana; tough mission! But his position has unexpected perils...and meanwhile, what of the mysterious Ben Khalif?
