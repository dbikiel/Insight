This full-contact action drama, loaded with authentic mixed martial arts, is a transcending inspirational story of redemption.
Inspired by actual events, Money Fight describes the plight of a young fighter who learns the hard way that the driving force behind a worthwhile victory is a valiant purpose.
Johnny (Ernie Reyes, Jr.) earns a meager existence working for his father as an auto-mechanic. At night, he races to the local MMA gym and trains with Sensei Gene (Ving Rhames) for a shot at becoming a Pro-MMA fighter. That is, until he falls for the Sensei's daughter (Sara Downing). Struggling to make extra cash for his young family, Johnny takes a job collecting for a steroid pusher. When the job goes south, he tries to pick up the pieces of his broken family, only to find that raw talent is not enough.
