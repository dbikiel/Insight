The scientist father of a teenage girl and boy accidentally shrinks his and two other neighborhood teens to the size of insects. Now the teens must fight diminutive dangers as the father searches for them.
On the brink of perfecting his state-of-the-art matter-shrinking machine, the suburban paterfamilias and indefatigable inventor, Professor Wayne Szalinski, realises that his device truly works, when it zaps both his kids and their friends. Now, to return to the relative safety of their home while being reduced to a mere quarter-inch size, the minuscule humans must venture out into the dense and perilous landscapes of their now-immense backyard--a hostile environment where nearly everything spells trouble. Can the kids exit the green maze of grass in one piece?
Wayne Szalinski is a crazy scientist who invents a shrinking machine that is so powerful it only blows things up. When the kid next door hits a baseball through the window and it lands in the path of the machine's laser, it begins working. Wayne's two kids plus the ones next door end up getting shrunk. Wayne accidentally sweeps them up and puts them out with the trash, so they then have to travel through the thick grass back to the house, while braving giant bugs, sprinklers, and a lawn mower.
A preoccupied inventor just can't seem to get his electromagnetic shrinking machine to work. Then, when he accidentally shrinks his kids down to 1/4-inch tall and tosses them out in the trash, the real adventure begins. Now they face incredible dangers as they try to make their way home through the jungle of their own backyard: hurricane sprinklers, dive-bombing bees, a runaway lawn mower, and much, much more.
