Flicka and Toby help out a struggling stable owner and her teenage daughter.
When Toby and Flicka are hired at a stable, Kelly, the owner's teenage daughter, quickly bonds with the wild horse. Despite her mother's disapproval, she hopes to break Flicka for an upcoming competition. However with the competition fast approaching, a dishonest rival trainer, and a growing fear they may be forced to sell the stable, Toby must intervene to save the day.
Toby needs a temporary job, so he becomes manager for the summer at a stud-farm which is going downhill since Lindy's husband died, assisted by her shy teen daughter Kelly, who matches instantly with his usually wild mustang mare Flicka. Spoiled high-school 'queen' Stephanie is determined to wreck former best friend Kelly, especially after hunky classmate Briggs chooses her over the rich brat, who seizes the first opportunity to have her horses and those of rich disciples withdrawn, and even gets trainer Paige to set up a rival stud-farm. Lindy's only hope to avoid having to sell is winning the equestrian competition, but with Steanie's gang deserting, Briggs must help Kelly select a new team, while Toby becomes their surprisingly able coach. They give Stephanie's team a good run for its money, with adversity for both.
