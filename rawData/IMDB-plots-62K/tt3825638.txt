A story that exposes the conspiracy of prominent German institutions and government branches to cover up the crimes of Nazis during World War II.
The year is 1958. The war has been over for thirteen years and the Federal Republic of Germany is not only recovering but even booming. But where are the Nazis? Who has ever heard of the death camps? It looks as if everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds in this land of milk and honey - At least, until the day journalist Thomas Gnielka reports on the recognition by a German-Jewish artist of a local schoolteacher, a former guard at the Auschwitz concentration camp - At least, until Johann Radmann, a young prosecutor, decides to investigate the case - Nobody knows it yet but this is the dawn of a new era. Even if the road to awareness will be long and rocky.
In late-1950s Frankfurt--in the aftermath of the shocking Nuremberg trials, thirteen long years after the end of WWII, and with Germany eager to return to normalcy--the idealistic and ambitious young public prosecutor, Johann Radmann, daringly accepts a case about a Waffen SS guard in Auschwitz. Now--as more than 8,000 people worked at the nightmarish death camp, and with the infamous war criminal, Josef Mengele, enjoying a tranquil life in Argentina--the righteous attorney undertakes the herculean task to unearth evidence in the mounds of dusty files at the U.S. Army Document Center. Teachers, doctors, lawyers, workers, neighbours, and fathers, almost everybody has a skeleton in the closet. What will it take to find the truth in the labyrinth of silence?
