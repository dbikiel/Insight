Joshua Tree, 1951 is the provocative and mesmerizing experimental portrait of an icon. Framed in a series of dreamlike, sometimes hallucinatory vignettes, the film draws on striking textures (velvety black-and-white 35mm, grainy bursts of color), highly stylized form, and the poetry of Arthur Rimbaud to question not only the established narrative of James Dean's life but also the process of star-making itself.
