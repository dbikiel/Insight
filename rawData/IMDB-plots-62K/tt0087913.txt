Paco, son of the commander of the Guardia Civil Evaristo Torrecuadrada, has been involved in Bilbao in the murder of a drug dealer couple. His fathers' efforts in suppressing evidence have nothing to do when the crime appears in the press. Paco is arrested and goes to prison, where he return to do drugs.
