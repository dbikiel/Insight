The Hughes' cottage vacation is violently interrupted by a family on a murderous and identity-stealing journey, in search of the "perfect" life.
After the accidental death of their six-year-old daughter, the Hughes family escape their busy upscale suburban life and head to their isolated cottage for some quality time. An evening with their friendly neighbors is suddenly interrupted when one mans obsession with perfection escalates into a violent struggle, forcing the families to go beyond what they ever thought they were capable of in order to survive.
Mark Hughes travels to his isolated cottage with his wife Mary and their son Brendon to recover from the loss of their little daughter. In the morning, Mark wakes-up with a family dropping wood on their porch. Bobby, Jane and their son Jared tell that they are neighbors that brought the wood to welcome them and Bobby asks if the Mark wouldn't like to have dinner with them. During the dinner, Mark has an argument with Bob and expel he and his family from his house. Soon they find that their house is under siege of Bob and his family that invade the house. When Mark's brother Toby arrives in the house to visit his brother and his family, Mark and Mary learn how insane the psychopath Bob is.
