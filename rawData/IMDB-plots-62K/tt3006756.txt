A woman meets a charming and wealthy man who becomes obsessive and controlling.
When hotel event planner Rachel breaks up with her boyfriend John, for cheating on her, she decides to go looking online for a new boyfriend. In the expanse of cyberspace, she meets a charming, wealthy man named Craig, who at first, seems perfect. He's attractive, fun, romantic, and he's been successfully running his mother's global real estate company while his mother, Doris travels the world. But Craig is far from perfect. He's obsessive and controlling, and once he sets his sights on Rachel, he has no plans of ever letting go.
