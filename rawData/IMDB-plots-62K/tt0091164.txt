A brilliant researcher in London who works as a high-class hooker in her spare time, becomes a pawn in a dangerous political game, when her latest client, a nobleman who is negotiating an Arab-Israeli peace treaty, falls for her.
Dr. Lauren Slaughter, a brilliant research fellow at the Arab-Anglo Institute in London is utterly frustrated by her career. To supplement her income, she starts moonlighting at the Jasmine Escort Service, where she has more control over men and money than she does at the office. On one of her dates, Lauren meets the politician Lord Sam Bulbeck who is trying to mediate a peace accord between the Arabs and Israelis. Bulbeck falls in love with his escort, and unwittingly, Lauren becomes a pawn in some very dirty politics.
Dr. Lauren Slaughter, a brilliant researcher at the Institute for Middle East Study Strategy, is facing economical difficulties since her paltry scholarship of one hundred fifty pounds sterling per week is insufficient to live in the expensive London. Lauren graduated from Harvard University with a Ph.D and had lived in China for many years, and is now working in the institute that seeks a special relationship with the Arab World. After a dinner in the house of banker Hugo Van Arkady, Lauren receives a videotape from the Jasmine Escort Service at home. When her chief, General Sir George Newhouse, publishes her research without any reference to her name, Lauren becomes upset and decides to moonlight at the escort service to raise money to move to Half Moon Street and have casual sex with eventual clients. When Lauren meets the prominent Lord Sam Bulbeck, who is negotiating a peace treaty between the Arabs and Israelis, they become lovers. However, Lauren does not know that she is being manipulated by powerful politicians to jeopardize the work of Lord Bulbeck.
