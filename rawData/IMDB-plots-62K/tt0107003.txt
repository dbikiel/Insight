This story of epic courage and grace is a remarkable window on Native American life and the early years of the last and most feared Apache War Chief.
The story of the greatest Native American warrior who, together with the rest of his Apache tribesmen, defied American and Mexican Armies in 1867. Finally caught and sent to a reservation camp, he eluded a military force of 5000 for 18 months before finally surrendering to the government.
