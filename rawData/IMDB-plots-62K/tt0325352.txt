An off-beat comedy about a former 80s pop star (Craig Ferguson) whose downward spiral is halted when he discovers he has a teenage daughter (Charlotte Church), the product of a weekend love affair.
A washed-up 80's pop star suddenly has a new direction in life when he discovers that he has a teenage daughter, Olivia, in Cardiff, Wales. The result of a weekend affair he had back at the height of his fame produced Olivia, a newspaper delivery girl for the South Wales Echo. He arrives in the small Welsh town, unsettling the life of his ex-lover while inspiring his newfound daughter to follow in his footsteps with a musical career of her own, against the wishes of her mother.
