Chris Hardwick is as charming as ever in this hour-long special. The @midnight host recalls how he found out where babies come from, shares his first old-man moment, talks about how terrible music was in the 90s and explains how inappropriate humor helped him cope with this father's death, all with his signature infectious enthusiasm.
