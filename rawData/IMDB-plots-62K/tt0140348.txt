A man tries to get his family back in shape after a stint in jail.
Kamal Haasan plays a simple-minded widower, whose attempt at Chit Fund management with a crooked pimp lands him in jail. While his own existence is made miserable by fellow convicts and corrupt wardens, his family disintegrates without a breadwinner. Upon his release, he has reconstruct his family while struggling to resist the temptation for vengeance.
Krishna (Kamal Haasan) is a widower living by the Cauveri river basin having two kids and a mother-in-law to support. He is conned by an urban con man (Haneefa). His mother-in-law also searches for a suitable bride for him so he can re-marry and live peacefully. However, instead of a simple life in the small-town Trichi, he starts a finance company in Chennai placing his faith in this conman. The money through public deposits are looted by the conman and Krishna is sent to jail.When Krishna comes out he finds that the conman has disintegrated his family totally by selling his daughter to a Calcatta based prostitute and his son gets lost and lives among the road-side nomads. He finds his son easily. However, he has much difficulty finding his daughter from the Sonagachi red-light slums.Once he reaches back home, the moaning of his 16 year old daughter who has suffered forced prostitution makes his blood boil and he sets out to kill the conman and his motivator, a politician. When the police arrive at the scene Krishna has no other option other than to chop off his hand with which the bad politician hangs for dear life at the edge of a high rise building. Krishna serves another jail term and finally gets united with his family.True to the analogy behind the story, a man's life is like a river which flows from ups (falls) and downs (streams) and settles down in a plain.
