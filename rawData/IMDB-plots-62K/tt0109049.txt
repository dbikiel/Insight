Tanzania's Serengeti Plains are the landscape we picture when we think of Africa. For millions of years, the drama of survival has played out here and once a year, millions of antelope migrate across this vast grassland to reach fresh pastures and mate.
The Serengeti is a huge area of grassland in Tanzania, Africa. Once a year, in the time of drought, about two million herd animals like antelopes travel north to feed and mate before moving south again, when plants there begin to blossom.
