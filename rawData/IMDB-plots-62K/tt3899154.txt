When a small town near the Arizona-Mexico border is wiped out overnight, suspicion falls on the lone survivor. But a roll of photos the survivor took that night tells a different story.
Something terrible passes through the off-grid town of Sangre de Cristo on the Arizona-Mexico border, and all 57 inhabitants disappear overnight, leaving nothing but bloody trails. Suspicion falls on the lone survivor, an illegal immigrant; but a roll of photos he took that night tells a different story.
On the night of June 2, 2011, the largest mass murder in American history occurs in the off-the-grid border town of Sangre de Cristo, Arizona, just a few miles north of Mexico. The entire population of 57 disappears overnight, and the next morning nothing is left but blood trails into the desertThe police arrest the lone survivor: an illegal immigrant, Francisco Salazar, who is found covered with the blood of a number of his fellow residents. Despite a lack of convincing forensic evidence, Salazar is charged with all the murders, against the backdrop of racial hysteria and paranoia that permeates the US/Mexico border.During the trial, a compelling new piece of evidence emerges: something terrible and remorseless passed through the town that night, and Salazar was the only one who recorded it. On one roll of film 36-photographs is the record of a gruesome wave of horror, and quite possibly, a haunting glimpse of more bloodshed to come.
