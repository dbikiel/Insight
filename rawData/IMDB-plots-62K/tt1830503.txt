A televised adaptation of the seminal Canadian play "Billy Bishop Goes to War". The play is inspired by the true exploits of WWI Flying Ace William Avery "Billy" Bishop. Accompanied by the award-winning writer/composer John Gray, Canadian acting legend Eric Peterson plays Bishop in his twilight years as he reminisces about his life.
