Dagwood gets in trouble at work when he buys the wrong property for his boss and when he is accused of punching out a client's son.
Dagwood is tricked into buying some swamp-land for Mr. Radcliffe, his boss, and, as a result, is demoted to office boy. However when Radcliffe discovers the lands real value he rushes to the Bumstead home to prevent Dagwood from re-selling the land back to the crooks. Blondie is way ahead of both men on getting this handled.
