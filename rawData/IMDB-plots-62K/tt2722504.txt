A beautiful road movie, and a chance to talk about love for Mexico through the eyes of an American.
A kind, broke and dying man , whose best pal is a beautiful pig named Howard , needs to find him a new loving home before he dies. He has what he thinks is the solution in Mexico and drives there with Howard only to see he will be horribly mistreated like all the other pigs waiting to be slaughtered. A great lesson in the sentience of animals, human connection and humanity.
