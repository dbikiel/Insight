Two dangerous convicts escape while transferring between jail houses. Cornered by the police, they find refuge in the lovely little house inhabited by the charming Roze family. Too bad for the wedding anniversary the family was planning to celebrate this evening: the criminal duo decides to hold everyone in the house hostage, just in case. While the felons gradually display their softer and nicer sides, the Rozes reveal themselves way less charming than it seemed, as the situation brings their worst instincts uninhibited.
