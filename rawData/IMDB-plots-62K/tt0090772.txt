Three prisoners from a Nazi prison camp (an American, an Italian and a German deserter), are trying to make their way through Nazi occupied territory and over to freedom. Along the way, they encounter a group of resistance fighters trying to disrupt the German supply lines. In addition, they also hear about a priceless treasure hidden somewhere that the Nazis are searching for. What will win out, the desire for freedom, the desire for revenge or the desire for money?
