This movie will surely make you believe in sincere mother's love for the second time.
Every year on the 8th of March (women's holiday, a holiday of spring and attention to women) Russians telephone network transfers millions of phone calls and SMSs. Hardworking analysts say that the vast majority of those messages and phone calls are addressed to the most important women in the life of every human - mothers. Handmade postcards and bouquets of flowers bought before our mom is awake these habits all have been left in our childhood. Now we congratulate mother in an adult way, we wait when she wakes up and call her.
But what if overloaded telephone network crashes down? There is no connection. What will people do? Someone will wait for the network to start working again to send a congratulation SMS or call his mother late in the evening or even on the next day. But others, who are like the characters of our anthology film, will change their plans to congratulate their moms personally as they did it in times of their childhood.
8 different congratulations and 8 different life situations. 8 different mothers.
