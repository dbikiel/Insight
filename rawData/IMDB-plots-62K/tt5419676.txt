Feminists: What Were They Thinking? takes aim at our current culture revealing all too vividly the urgent need for continued change.
In 1977, a book of photographs captured an awakening - women shedding the cultural restrictions of their childhoods and embracing their full humanity. Feminists: What Were They Thinking? revisits those photos, those women and those times - and takes aim at our current culture revealing all too vividly the urgent need for continued change. The film offers candid and riveting interviews with women such as Jane Fonda, Gloria Steinem, Lily Tomlin and Judy Chicago tackling topics ranging from identity, abortion, race, childhood and motherhood.
