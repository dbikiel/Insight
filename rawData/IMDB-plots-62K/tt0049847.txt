Three London gentlemen take vacation rowing down the Thames, encountering various mishaps and misadventures along the way.
Harris, J, and George decide to take a holiday boating up the Thames to Oxford. Battling against Hampton Court maze, tents, rain, locks, and Henley Regatta the accident-prone threesome have one success anyway - they meet Sophie, Primrose and Bluebell.
Three men-about-town want to get away from it all and decide to take a boat ride on the Thames. George is happy to get away from his job at the bank. Harris is glad to get away from Mrs. Willis who is pressing him to marry her daughter Clara; and 'J' is more than anxious to take a holiday from his wife, Etherbertha. George meets three girls, Sophie Clutterhouse and sisters Bluebell and Primrose Porterhouse, who are also taking a ride up the river, and he hopes to see them again. The travelers get into all kinds of complications with the weather, the river, the boat, food, etc. They do connect with the girls again and when things appear to be becoming interesting for the men, Mrs. Willis and her daughter and Ethelbertha show up and things become even more interesting.
