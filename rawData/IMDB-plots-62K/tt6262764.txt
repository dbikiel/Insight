Teenage model Cora (played by Disney star Debby Ryan) is the daughter of the head of a major modelling agency and has always worked hard to live up to the expectations of her mother (Danielle Carter). When a damaging video of Cora goes viral she departs for Australia to spend time with her aunt Margot (Genevieve Hegney). Margot is also facing her own difficulties and their time together becomes a learning experience for them both.
