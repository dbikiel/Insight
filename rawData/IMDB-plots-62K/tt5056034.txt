A small town girl who moved to New York to pursue her dreams returns home for the holidays, only to realize that maybe her dreams aren't miles away, but right in her hometown.
Beth Baker is an out-of-work actress stuck in New York City without her friends at Christmas time. She decides to return home to the quaint small town she escaped 10 years before and finds a place far different than the hamlet she left. She suddenly finds performing possibilities and even romance.
Beth Baker, a struggling New York actress, feels like an outsider to the city's theater community. That struggle includes sleeping on her friend Nicole's sofa. She doesn't want to admit to anyone not in the know of what she considers her failure, especially as she was voted the most likely to succeed while in high school. Largely because of everyone always telling her that she was destined for greatness, Beth, not knowing anything else in life, believed the only way to achieve that greatness was to be a Broadway star. As a Christmas gift, Nicole gives Beth, who has no obligations over the holidays, a trip back to her small hometown of Kern so that she will not be alone at Christmas. Otherwise, she would have spent Christmas in New York on Nicole's sofa waiting to hear the news if she got the part in a Broadway play that would truly catapult her into the New York theater scene. As much as she looks forward to seeing her bakery owner mom Shirley Baker, Beth does not want to return home a failure, and isn't looking forward to seeing her old boyfriend, Barry McCormick, who at the last minute broke things off with her when he wouldn't go with her to New York. But back in Kern where Beth ends up getting ensconced in the Christmas goings-on, Beth may redefine her view of greatness with a little help from a tree lot Santa, and another old friend from high school, Dean Hubert.
