Harry Arno is a Miami Beach bookie who finds himself in trouble with his mob bosses for reasons he can't quite figure out. When an assailant attempts to kill him, he decides that it's time to retire, so he gives Raylan the slip and relocates to Greece. He gets lonely and so he invites his girlfriend Doris to join him. He's afraid that his enemies might follow her to him, and he's right. The story then shifts to Raylan, who does his earnest best to get to the bottom of the story.
