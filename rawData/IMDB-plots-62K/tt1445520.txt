Eliezer and Uriel Shkolnik are father and son as well as rival professors in Talmudic Studies. When both men learn that Eliezer will be lauded for his work, their complicated relationship reaches a new peak.
The story of a great rivalry between a father and son, both eccentric professors in the Talmud department of Hebrew University in Jerusalem. The son has an addictive dependency on the embrace and accolades that the establishment provides, while his father is a stubborn purist with a fear and profound revulsion for what the establishment stands for, yet beneath his contempt lies a desperate thirst for some kind of recognition. The Israel Prize, Israel's most prestigious national award, is the jewel that brings these two to a final, bitter confrontation.
Professor Eliezer Shkolnik and his middle-aged son Uriel are both philologists and Talmudic scholars, however, Eliezer, even though he has been labouring for nearly all his life, he still remains in obscurity with his sole recognition being a single footnote of a work by an esteemed scholar. On the other hand, much to cranky Eliezer's chagrin, the driven Professor Uriel seems to be showered with recognition, fame and all the things he ever longed for; a distressful topic and the reason for a subtle, yet bitter academic rivalry. Is that it then? A brief reference in a book for a life's work?
