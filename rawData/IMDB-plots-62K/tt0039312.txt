Released from a POW camp at the end of WW2, a French soldier tricks the wife of a fellow French POW into believing her husband was killed by the Germans, and seduces the grieving woman but the 'dead' husband eventually returns home.
Shortly after WWII, flashbacks tell the story of Marise, her husband Paul, and Jean, who was imprisoned with Paul in a German camp. While attempting to escape from the camp Paul is shot, and Jean goes to see Marise, confirming the news she had gotten already about Paul's death. Jean has fallen in love with Marise through the stories Paul told him, and wants to stay with her in the seaside town in Brittany where Paul owned a small business.
