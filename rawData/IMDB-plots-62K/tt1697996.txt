A documentary on the hate crime assault and subsequent death of a Latino man in Shenandoah Pennsylvania, including the alleged cover-up and shocking court verdicts.
Shenandoah is a 2012 documentary directed and produced by David Turnley. This documentary focuses on racial issues within a rather "old-school" Americana community. Turnley does a wonderful job portraying how the lifestyle and history of the Shenandoah Valley people, ultimately played into the anti-immigration theme after the outbreak of the tragic event. The history within the Shenandoah Valley is that its a coal-mining town. The older generation of men and women who have either worked in the mines or had family working in the mines, did not necessarily take well to these new foreign immigrants coming in and working for lower wages. The older generation taught the youth to not like the "aliens" because they were the ones affected by the influx of immigrants to the town. The youth involved within the crisis admittedly only attacked this man because he started screaming at them in a language that was unfamiliar to them. That, and the fact that they had been consuming alcohol. The documentary did a nice job showing how the town rallied towards the side of the children, just because Ramirez happened to be from Mexico, but at the end of the film, some of the citizens from S.V. were "ashamed" because of the verdict and how others within the community had handled the situation.
