A gambler has plans to swindle money from a charity program, but starts to have second thoughts when he falls for a rich society girl.
Joe Adams takes on the identity of a dead gangster in order to avoid the draft. Adams plans to use a war relief charity to get his gambling operation up and running, until he falls in love with Dorothy Bryant and has a change of heart.
Joe Adams, a smoothly suave professional gambler and con man, assumes the 4-F identity of Joe Bascapolous, a small-time Greek career criminal now deceased, in order to avoid being drafted. The cynical Adams, stuck with an unsuccessful gambling ship, insinuates himself into a charity for war refugees by charming one of its directors, beautiful young socialite Dorothy Bryant. Over the objections of her grandfather, she becomes romantically involved with him and agrees to allow him to fleece rich socialites during a proposed casino night for charity. Con man Adams has no intention of splitting with anyone but his larcenous cronies until he reads something that causes him to have a change of heart.
