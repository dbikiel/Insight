From a remote mountain village in Tunisia, Kalt, a female hacker hijacks the airwaves in Northern Africa and France to broadcast political messages. When Julia, a French Intelligence officer, gets on the case, she flies in from France to infiltrate the hacker world and find out who is behind the interruptions. Things quickly turn into a cat-and-mouse game as Kalt and Julia play each other to get what they want.
In the contemporary Tunisian thriller Bedwin Hacker, a female media pirate - holed up in a remote outpost in the mountains of Tunisia - figures out a way to take over the television and radio airwaves in France and North Africa to broadcast political messages. The irritated French Intelligence service closes in on her, which leads to a tit-for-tat game of intrigue between the hacker and her pursuers. Helmed by a female director, this film is of some historical significance, given its unusually frank, straightforward, and accurate portrayal of the day-to-day experiences of north African women.
