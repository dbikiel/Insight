Shortly after the end of World War II, British Colonel Michael S. "Hooky" Nicobar (Walter Pidgeon) is assigned to a unit in the British Zone of Vienna. His duty is to aid the Soviet authorities to repatriate citizens of the Soviet Union, many of whom prefer not to return to their home country. Billeted in the convent run by Mother Auxilia (Ethel Barrymore), Nicobar, and his military aides Major John "Twingo" McPhimister (Peter Lawford) and Audrey Quail (Dame Angela Lansbury), become involved in the plight of young ballerina Olga Alexandrova (Janet Leigh), who is trying to avoid being returned to Moscow. Nicobar's sense of duty is tested as he sees first hand the plight of the people he is helping return to the Soviet Union; his lack of religious faith is also shaken by his contact with the Mother Superior.
The story of Russian ballerina Olga Alexandrova (Janet Leigh) in Vienna in 1945, who is befriended by, and falls in love with, British Major John "Twingo" McPhimister (Peter Lawford) when they meet in the convent in which she is hiding from the Russian authorities. British Colonel Michael S. "Hooky" Nicobar (Walter Pidgeon) turns her over to the Russians when they present a trumped-up story, but discovers the lie when he sees her on a Displaced Persons train later. Mother Auxilia (Ethel Barrymore) and the Colonel set about trying to get her freed.
