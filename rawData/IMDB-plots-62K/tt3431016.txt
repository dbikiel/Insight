Jack, a tortured soul, spends his days grudgingly seeing and speaking to the dead, helping deliver their messages to the loved ones left behind while trying to seek some respite from his tormented past and present.
We all want to believe in life after death and imagine loved ones looking over us, feel their presence in a draft of air, or the faint essence of a familiar smell. It's what we crave, knowing they wait for us. But Jack isn't waiting - they won't leave him alone. Some might call Jack a troubled soul, at odds with the world, unable to conform. If you saw him in the pub - disheveled and drunk, talking to himself - you'd stay well away, think he was disturbed somehow, crazy. But Jack has a sharp mind and a razor wit. It's not that he doesn't want to live a normal life, he can't. They won't let him.
Jack is a tortured soul who grudgingly delivers the messages of the dead to the loved ones they've left behind. After a difficult and dysfunctional upbringing, and a heartbreaking tragedy, he learns of his ability to see and speak to the dead. As an adult he spends his days seeing and speaking to the recently deceased, and helping them move on, while craving some respite from his ability while trying to come to terms with the tragedies of the past, being outcast by the community, and trying to convince his psychologist this his ability is more than just a result of serious mental health issues.
