Two stories for the price of one: Lenny works in a video shop and tries to get aquainted with the waitress Lea. Leo beats his pregnant wife, Louise, which is a VERY bad idea, as her brother, Louis, is a violent racist.
Leo and Louise are a young couple living together in Copenhagen. Leo often goes out with his friends while Louise usually stays home. But when Louise tells Leo she's pregnant, a spark is ignited and Leo begins to become cold and distant. His anger and self-hatred finally erupt into violence against Louise.
In Copenhagen, Leo is going increasingly off the rails, frustrated by his shit job, tiny apartment and the fact that his wife Louise is pregnant. To escape from his claustrophobia, he meets up with Louis a racist bouncer at his club, where Leo witnesses a shooting and vicious beating. Initially shaken by the violence, he becomes increasingly seduced by it.
