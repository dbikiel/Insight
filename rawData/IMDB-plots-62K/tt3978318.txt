Bad Girl is the story of Quinn Robinson, a Pastor's daughter who learns a valuable life lesson while at Christian Summer Camp. Pastor Robinson and his family are just settling into their new house and new church home. Pastor Robinson is a stern man with a high school sports and military background. His wife Melinda grew up in hard times during her childhood, but as an adult wants to enjoy the finer things in life. Their daughter Quinn is attending Christian School and is the most popular girl there. She's happy to move into a bigger home to get some privacy but not so happy about moving out of the apartment building where her boyfriend Roman Kraft lived. They have been seeing more and more of each other and Roman is ready to take it to the "next" step. Even though Quinn is a mischievous little girl, she was still in fact a girl and not willing to take the big step into womanhood. Pastor Robinson notices the two getting closer and decides it would be a great idea for Quinn to attend summer camp this year to let the two young lovebirds cool off for a few months. While Quinn is having a rough time in school her parents are equally challenged with their marriage becoming stale while under the churches scrutiny. Pastor and Melinda must keep their marriage from failing all while keeping their daughter's virtue in tact. While they all attend summer camp Quinn plots to get to the biggest high school house party of the year to meet her boyfriend and Pastor Robinson fights to keep the two kids from moving too fast. Bad Apple is a cat and mouse story of young love, love on the rocks and the love of community standing together for the betterment of one another.
