When their ship docks the crew disembark as usual to pick up their lives in postwar London. For one of them his petty smuggling turns more serious when he finds himself caught up with a robbery in the City.
Crime melodrama about two sailors in London, an American open to theft and smuggling and an honest Jamaican, and the crooks and girls they know. A jewel theft goes wrong and those involved must decide whether to try to get away or to do the right thing. Superb photography of postwar central London when almost empty of people on a Sunday.
