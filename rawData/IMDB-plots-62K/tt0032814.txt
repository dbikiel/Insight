Donald is headed for Daisy. However, his nephews are too.
Donald is heading out for a night on the town with Daisy, but first he needs to ditch his resourceful nephews. Easier said than done. They get to Daisy's house first, but Donald buys them off with ice cream, which works for about 10 seconds. Eventually, Donald and Daisy do some pretty wild dancing, made wilder when the nephews get a hot ear of popcorn into Donald.
