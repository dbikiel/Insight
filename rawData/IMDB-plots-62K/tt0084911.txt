Leonard Vole (Beau Bridges) is accused of murdering an elderly rich woman, and the only alibi to him depends on his wife Christine (Dame Diana Rigg).
Efficient, but bitter and stubborn, barrister Sir Wilfred Robarts (Sir Ralph Richardson) returns to his office in London, having recovered from a heart attack. He is subsequently invited to defend Leonard Vole (Beau Bridges), who is the prime suspect in a murder case. Leonard is a former soldier that fought in World War II and is married to his beloved German wife Christine Vole (Dame Diana Rigg). He is unemployed and accused of seducing and murdering the wealthy middle-aged single woman, Emily French, to inherit eighty thousand pounds sterling.
Sir Wilfred Robarts, a famed barrister is released from the hospital, where he stayed for two months following his heart attack. Returning to the practise of his lawyer skills, he takes the case of Leonard Vole, an unemployed man who is accused for murdering an elderly lady friend of his, Mrs. Emily French. While Leonard Vole claims innocent, although every evidence turns to him as the killer, his alibi witness, his cold German wife Christine, instead of entering the court as a witness for the defense, she becomes the witness for the prosecution and strongly claims her husband is guilty of murder. Sir Wilfred believes there's something suspicious on the case, especially on Mrs. Vole.
