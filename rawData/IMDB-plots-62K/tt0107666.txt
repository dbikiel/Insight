Boy loves mother who dies giving birth. Boy kills baby brother. 50 years later boy, now doctor, sells a neighboring house cheaply to a pregnant woman who looks like his mom and wants to be her doctor. Will he also kill her unborn son?
A young couple, Mary and John, awaiting a baby is in search for a house when they decide to buy that lovely old villa they found by coincidence. What they both do not know is that Myron, the owner of that villa and their new neigbour, is a dangerous psychopath and that Mary reminds him of his dead mother. Mary begins to wonder about Myron's odd behaviour, but everybody thinks Mary's fears are due to her being pregnant.
