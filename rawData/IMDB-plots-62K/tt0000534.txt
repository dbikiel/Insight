A British trick film in which a motorist ends up driving around the rings of Saturn.
A magical glowing white motorcar dismembers policemen, drives up buildings, flies through outer space and can transform into a horse and carriage. This was a British effort to top Melies at his Sci-Fi/fantasy/comedy trick films.
Two motorists on the run from the police racing around the city's corners at breakneck speed, use the extraordinary abilities of their one-of-a-kind vehicle to take off into the sky. As the car flies effortlessly through the cloudy atmosphere, before long, it enters the boundless space for a quick visit to the Moon, and then, the glorious rings of Saturn before returning to Mother Earth's bosom. What an amazing voyage into the great unknown.
