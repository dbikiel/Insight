When Tack upsets ZigZag the Vizier, the wizard drags him off to the royal castle, where Princess YumYum falls for the bashful boy and saves him from execution. Unfortunately, ZigZag plans to marry the Princess in order to succeed her father, King Nod. The Thief, meanwhile, is more interested in gold than love and takes off with the protective orbs topping the palace. Together, Tack and YumYum attempt to retrieve them in order to prevent ZigZag and the One-Eye army from conquering the city.
Designed in the 1960s, this Arabian Nights fantasy uses expressive animation to detail the story of a shy, nearly silent cobbler, who tries to win the affections of a distant Princess. Meanwhile, the entertainingly evil, rhyme-speaking Grand Vizier ZigZag tries to win the Princess' hand, and wages war on the peaceful Golden City. It's up to a rather odd, unspeaking local thief to set things right by accident.
