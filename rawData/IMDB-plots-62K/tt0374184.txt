A monk turned body-builder, with the gift to see into people's lives, befriends a female cop, and uses his gift to change the force of Karma and her destiny.
Exotic dancer Dai Jet Lo (brawny man) has a gift to see through "cause and consequence". He meets a female cop and uses his gift to help her capture an extremely dangerous murderer. The female cop learns that Dai Jet Lo was once a monk who, due to the murder of a friend, left the monastery to find the killer. The female cop also has a inevitable "karma" that dooms her to die an unnatural death. The duo decide to oppose "cause and consequence" and change what cannot be changed.
