Orchestra manager Steve Hollis realizes that big-band music is dead. People want something new, but what? On their way to New York, Steve and his companion Corny, stop at a motel in a small place called Strawberry Springs. It's Saturday evening, and a huge number of young people are going to the Town Hall to listen to a local band called Bill Haley and His Comets, playing a new kind of music called rock'n'roll. It is accompanied by a new way of dancing, led by the siblings Lisa and Jimmy Johns. Steve immediately recognizes that this could be what all America is waiting for. He convinces the band and the dancers to let him organize their nationwide breakthrough, and goes to New York to arrange bookings with the top agent Corinne Talbot. Corinne has for a long time tried to get Steve to marry her, but in vain. She now realizes that Steve is in love with the young dancer Lisa Johns, which makes her change her strategy. Corinne tries to stop the rock'n'roll group everywhere, but despite all her efforts they soon are a big success all over the country. And Lisa is smarter than Corinne.
