A former British colony in dire need of economic aid tries to play the British against the Soviets in an attempt to secure economic aid from either side in return for political loyalty.
Great Britain has had an international agreement for the last 50 years with a small pacific island. It has been ignored until the death of their king brings it to the attention of the Foreign Office in Whitehall. They decide to send Cadogan de Vere Carlton-Browne to re-establish friendly relations.
When Britain granted the warring island of Gaillardia self government they forgot to tell their Resident Advisor. Years later the Foreign Office are dumbfounded to receive an urgent message from their faithful employee reporting the suspicious activities of a bunch of Russian spies dressed as Cossacks going round digging holes everywhere. The F.O. muster their finest, or at least Carlton-Browne, to undertake a goodwill visit, while a chance meeting between Loris, the new king of north Gaillardia, and lovely Princess Ilyena from the south looks like it might change the political - and romantic - situation anyway.
