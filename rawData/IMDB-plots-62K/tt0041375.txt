Is man's existence really meaningful and hopeful? As a reply to Ingmar Bergman's FÃ¤ngelse (1949), this movie claims that it is. A ring passes between a lot of different people, giving the bearer or someone close a new meaning to life. Actors, embezzlers, old ladies and cheated husbands all seem to gain temporary hope from misery and disillusionment.
