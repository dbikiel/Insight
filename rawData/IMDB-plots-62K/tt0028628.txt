To avoid a taxi war, city officials blame a gang bombing on driver Joe Benton's wife Anna and put her on a ship to deport her. The mayor is speaker at a boxers' banquet where Joe pleads for them to go with him to the wharf and rescue Anna (about to deliver their baby) from the ship.
Joe Benton is an independent cabdriver. He and his fellow independents are constantly harassed by drivers from the Comet Taxi Company, which has hired ruffians to steal business from the independents. When a coincidence makes Joe's foreign-born wife Anna appear guilty of murder and sabotage in the bombing of Comet's garage, the district attorney's office decides to deport her as a means of leveraging an end to the taxi wars. But Joe and his pals find unexpected help in their efforts to save Anna and to make their livings in peace.
