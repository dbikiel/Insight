Kay Hoog wants to stop the organisation "Die Spinnen" to get a certain diamond, that will give the owning woman the crown of Asia, but the man, who should be the owner of that diamond, doesn't know of its existence....
In San Francisco, the sportsman Kay Hoog follows Lio Sha in a subterranean Chinatown and discloses that her organization is seeking a Buddha-head diamond that will release Asia from tyranny. He is captured, but he escapes and chases The Spiders, embarking as a stowaway in the Storm Bird. The ship heads to London, with the criminals trying to find the diamond in the mansion of the millionaire Terry Landon. They do not succeed and abduct Terry's daughter Ellen asking the diamond as ransom. However, Terry does not have the stone, and Kay Hoog discovers that it is in the Malvinas Island. He goes to the island, where he faces The Spiders.
