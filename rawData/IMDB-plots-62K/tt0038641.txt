During his bitter old age, Shanti Andía is gathering the fragments of a diary written at different times of his life. So we know his childhood in the Basque village of Lúzaro, his dreamy youth in Cádiz land, his adventures and misadventures as commander and, above all, the fascination for his uncle Juan de Aguirre, imitation of ancient Basque sailors and true hero whose life adventuress is full of colorful adventures. With the consciousness of a wasted life, Shanti Andía shows an immense nostalgia for the sea that once roamed virile thirst for adventure, always in conflict with mainstream society of men.
