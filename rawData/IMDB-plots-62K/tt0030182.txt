A bandit disguises himself as an officer in an attempt to woo a saloon singer.
Mary Robbins is a moderately educated, beautiful, young woman who owns the saloon called "The Poker". She is the only woman in the town of Cloudee-making her the fancy of all the men there, especially to Sheriff Jack Rance. On the way to Monterey to sing at a mass officiated by Father Sienna, her stagecoach is held up by the infamous masked bandit, Ramerez. He too takes a fancy to Mary, and decides to secretly follow her, taking on the identity of an officer named, Lieutenant Johnson. While in Monterey, he dances, sings and courts Mary, who has now fallen in love with him. He then has to make a quick getaway. In the mean-time, Sheriff Jack has set up a trap to catch Ramerez at "The Poker". When Ramerez does arrive he soon discovers that Mary is the owner, and quickly changes to the identity of Lieutenant Johnson. How long can this sherade last?
The heroine orphan girl Mary Robbins (Jeanne Ellis) from Kentucky migrates to California before the "Gold Rush," and another orphan, the antihero boy Gringo Ramerez (Bill Cody, Jr.) rescued from indians by a former Spanish general turned bandito (Noah Beery), experiences love at first sight remembering her singing a favorite song her mother taught her. They may never meet again until by chance many years later. Everybody loves Mary (Jeanette MacDonald), the owner of the local saloon including the hero Sheriff Jack Lance (Walter Pidgeon) and bandito Ramerez (Nelson Eddy). How will Mary's heart be won -- stolen or rescued -- and can she be a true love?
