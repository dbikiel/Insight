When a cop's crooked past comes back to get him, can he do the right thing, or will he succumb to the threats of his dangerous connections?
In Bridgeport, Connecticut, Detective David 'Cal' Callahan is a family man, married to Alexandra with a teenage daughter, Lanie. Cal has an unscrupulous past, drug and alcohol addicted, and he was reborn when he was shot by a drug dealer and saved by a stranger. When a stranger meets Cal in a bar, he tells Cal that he was the one who saved him and gives the journal of his deceased daughter to Cal. He tells Cal that she committed suicide after she was beaten up and raped by Angel, a regular at the night-club where she danced, owned by the drug dealer Royce Walker. Cal investigates Angel and when he sees the man in his car in front of the school where Lanie studies, he believes that Angel is a pedophile and Cal decides to take action. But he finds that he is a marionette and someone is pulling the strings and watching him dance.
