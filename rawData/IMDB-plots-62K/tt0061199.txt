Christopher Robin's bear attempts to raid a beehive in a tall tree.
Winnie the Pooh, the honey loving silly old bear attempts to get honey from a bee tree, so after climbing the tree didn't work, he borrows Christopher Robin's balloon, dunks himself in mud and floats to the top of the honey tree incognito as a little black rain cloud. After escaping the angry bees, Pooh decides to get honey the old fashion way: getting some from Rabbit, so after stuffing his face with all of Rabbit's honey, Pooh attempts to climb out Rabbit's front door, but becomes stuck! No matter how hard everyone tries, they can't get him out, so they wait for Pooh to lose weight before they can get him out. Then along comes Gopher who agrees to help get Pooh out and almost feeds him more honey! But then one morning, Pooh is finally freed from the doorway and ends up in another sticky situation-quite literally!
