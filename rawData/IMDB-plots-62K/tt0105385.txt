A shyster with an equally eccentric kung-fu ace of a wife manage to bring justice to the court.
Stephen Chow's special brand of very modern, very Hong Kong screwball comedy entered a new phase with Justice, My Foot!, a costume farce set in imperial China. Chow is a shyster with an equally eccentric kung-fu ace of a wife, hilariously played with Anita Mui Yim-fong. Accompanied by Chow's number one screen sidekick, Ng Man-tat, he manages to bring justice to the court and laughter to the viewer.
