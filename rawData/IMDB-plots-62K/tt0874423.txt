A look at the life of an Enumclaw, Washington man who died as a result of an unusual encounter with a horse.
It's not a look in the life of the man who died. It is a story about the MEN who met on a regular basis to have intimate relations with horses.documentary about the the real 2005 death of a Washington State man who punctured his colon from having sex with a horse. The film badly and vaguely describes a group of men who would meet at a farm and have regular, and sometimes videotaped, intimate relations with horses. The doc is badly made and details of the story take an excruciatingly long time to surface. There are, however first hand accounts in the film.
