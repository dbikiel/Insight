Twin girls advertise their single father on a Santa Monica Billboard.
Tess and Emily are twins living in LA. All they want is for their dad to meet someone so they make a billboard ad for him. This follows by many responses. He agrees
to go on 5 dates all being failures then finally meets someone
who unfortunately Nigel doesnt approve of and tries to ruin!
