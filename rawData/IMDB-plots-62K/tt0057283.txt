In 1800s Texas, during the early days of circuit-courts, lawyers had to be handy with their guns as well as with their law books when facing lynch mobs bent on administering frontier justice.
Circuit-riding Texas lawyer Timothy Higgins defends a former girlfriend against a murder charge stemming from an extortionist's threat to reveal her shady past. Through adroit courtroom work, Higgins is able to acquit her and reveal who actually shot the fatal bullet.
