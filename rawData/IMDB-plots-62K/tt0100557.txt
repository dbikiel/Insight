When a young woman investigates her town's Nazi past, the community turns against her.
Sonja is a German high school student who participates in a writing contest and endeavors to write an essay about her town's history during the Third Reich and its resistance to it. To her dismay, and more so the town's, she uncovers instead definite collaboration during the period. As she digs deeper, she must struggle against the town's vocal and violent opposition to her search for the truth.
