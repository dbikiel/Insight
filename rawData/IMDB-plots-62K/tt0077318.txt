The true story of a part aboriginal man who finds the pressure of adapting to white culture intolerable, and as a result snaps in a violent and horrific manner.
Jimmie Blacksmith is half aborigine who was raised by the Rev. Neville and his wife. They've taught him western values and his goal in life is to earn enough money to buy a farm and marry a white girl. He's a hard worker, putting in long days building farm fences. He soon finds himself married when a white girl says he fathered the child he is carrying. When a farmer refuses to pay for a job he's completed things get out of hand and Jimmie goes on the run wanted for murder.
