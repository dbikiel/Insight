After a long and unsuccessful period trying to have a family, Claire and Adrian finally adopt a girl. The arrival of Isabel is welcomed by almost the whole family, but adjusting an eight-year-old girl with a past of her own to a new life might be something more complicated than they expected. Strange things start to happen from the moment Isabel and "her imaginary friend Stevie" come to live with them. The situation becomes more complicated when Stevie's behavior becomes aggressive. Only Claire and Isabel know that Stevie is more than just a figment of Isabel's imagination. Claire will do everything to find out who Stevie is and what he wants. Perhaps if she succeeds, she will be able to recoup their lives and have the family she had desired for so long.
