A massive asteroid impact on the moon begins causing storms on earth due to the sudden changes in ocean tides. But when further examination is conducted it's discovered that the moon's structure is now entirely unstable -- threatening all life on earth. With time running out, a team of scientists turn to one man, demolitions expert John Redding, in effort to find a solution and secure the moon.
The low-budget, sci-fi movie Earthstorm opens with an interstellar catastrophe. A massive asteroid slams into the moon, dramatically altering the Earth's ocean tides and triggering sweeping storms. At closer glance, however, scientists learn that the moon's structure is now entirely unstable and that large chunks of it will soon fly off and hit the Earth, damaging all life on that planet. With no other answer in sight, scientists solicit the help of a demolitions man (Stephen Baldwin), who promises to devise a workable solution.
