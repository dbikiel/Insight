A Millionairess and a doctor cannot marry until they meet conditions set-up by their respective parents.
London-based Millionairess Epifania (Sophia Loren) is attracted to Dr. Kabir (MD from Delhi and PhD from Calcutta), who is more intent on treating patients. When she persists, he confides in her that he had made a commitment to his late widowed seamstress mother that he will wed any woman who will manage to survive on just Rs.500/-, for 90 days. She finds out that this sum is equivalent to just 35 shillings but readily accepts this challenge. She also informs him that her late father had also imposed a condition that she must wed a male who will turn £500 into £15000 within the same period. Epifania then finds employment with an Italian firm, ends up re-organizing, and turning up the firm's profits. At the end of 90 days, she goes to meet Kabir and discovers that he has not only given all the money away but also has no interest whatsoever in marrying her.
When her father dies, Epifania Parerga, an Italian in London, becomes the world's richest woman. She feels incomplete without a husband and falls in love with a humble, Indian physician, Ahmed el Kabir, much loved by his indigent English patients. He eschews physical pleasure, so he rejects her overtures, which include sexual flirtation, offers of wealth, an opportunity to run a state-of-the-art clinic, and then her simple and direct declaration of love. They agree to a contest: she'll try the test of love his mother taught him (to live for 90 days with only 500 rupees), and she asks him to try her father's test: to turn £500 into £15,000 within 3 months. She's game; will he even try?
