A defecting Soviet scientist is hit by a nuclear explosion near Yucca Flats and roams around as a beast.
A defecting Russian scientist is transformed by an atomic test into a hulking monster (Tor Johnson, of course). Not much else except some people are killed, boys get lost, and a rabbit sniffs Tor's corpse. This film was used for Mystery Science Theater 3000.
Coffee-obsessed B-movie auteur Coleman Francis was unleashed upon an unsuspecting world with this standard "man becomes radioactive monster" movie rendered hilariously surreal entertainment by the soundtrack having been lost in production and replaced by nonsensical rambling narration from a drunk-sounding Francis.
A rotund Russian spy Joseph Javorsky (Tor Johnson) is being chased through the Yucca Flats, Nevada Test Site by agents trying to get a briefcase full of secrets he possesses about the United States. As the chase ensues an Atomic bomb is detonated killing the agents but endowing Javorsky with burned skin, insanity and a homicidal drive. Javorsky is turned into a beast and roams the Nevada environs seeking people to kill. A State Ranger Douglas Mellor (Hank Radcliffe) discovers the presence of the beast and tracks him down but not before the beast traps a couple of small boys intent on making them his next victims.
