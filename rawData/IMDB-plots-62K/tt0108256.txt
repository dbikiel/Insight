On a lazy afternoon, a man shares his memories of a storyteller friend who once narrated a convoluted love story with intertwined plots. As these plots unravel, reality mixes with fiction.
"This film narrative takes place over seven days during which time Manek Mulla, a young man barely out of his teens, tells three stories about himself. These stories revolve around Manek's involvement with women. In each case one or another circumstance leads to his separation from his beloved. The tone of the stories is tongue-in- cheek and sometimes borders on the fantastic and surreal. There is consistency and ambiguity a blurring of distinction between the real and the invented.For Menak Mulla, the purpose of telling these stories is to define the meaning of love. As it transpires, none of the stories Manek tells actually define Love. If they do, they define what love is not.
The film is a comedy but not without a twinge of pain and a sense of loss.
