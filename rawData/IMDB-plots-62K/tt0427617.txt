When therapist Dr. Leonard Stern discovers he has six weeks to live, he adopts a fresh method of treatment: brutal honesty.
Dr. Stern, a clinical psychologist, leads a well ordered life, self-contained, neat, precise, and scheduled. We watch his appointments with eight patients, as he asks questions, listens, and advises them that all will improve in due time. Then, he gets a call from an oncologist who gives him very bad news. Suddenly, "in due time" becomes "right now": Stern's therapy methods change, and so do the fortunes of his patients.
