The lives of four black students at an Ivy League college.
A social satire that follows the stories of four black students at an Ivy League college where controversy breaks out over a popular but offensive black-face party thrown by white students. With tongue planted firmly in cheek, the film explores racial identity in acutely-not-post-racial America while weaving a universal story of forging one's unique path in the world.
At prestigious Winchester University, biracial student Samantha White begins her radio show, "Dear White People, the amount of Black friends required not to seem racist has just been raised to two. Sorry, your weed man Tyrone doesn't count." Sam becomes president of the all-Black residential hall Parker-Armstrong, whose existence is facing extinction in the name of diversification. TV reality show "Black Face/White Place" smells gold in Sam's story and decides to follow it, rejecting the proposal of fellow Black student Coco Conners, who pitched a show titled "Doing Time at an Ivy League." The clamor over Sam's rise also becomes a career-defining opportunity for Black misfit Lionel Higgins when he is asked to join the school's lily-white newspaper staff to cover the controversy, even though he secretly knows little about Black culture.
When Samantha White (Tessa Thompson) begins her radio program by declaring that white people will now be required to have two black friends in order to avoid appearing racist (and that drug dealers don't count), she immediately catches the attention of the all-black residential hall that is being forced out of existence due to diversification. Subsequently elected president of the hall, Samantha becomes the subject of a reality show that deals with racial issues. Meanwhile, the Winchester University's all-white student newspaper staff mistakenly assumes that young black outcast Lionel Higgins (Tyler James Williams) is an expert on black culture, and recruits him to report on the brewing controversy..
