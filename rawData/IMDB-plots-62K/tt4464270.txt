Day before Easter 2012, perfectly lined up bodies of four teenagers, each with a bullet hole in their head, were found near a lake just outside Skopje, Macedonian capital. They just went fishing. The nation was shocked. The rumours run wild. Ethnic tensions were boiling. The police investigation, officially named "Monsters", pointed to Islamists terrorists. Two years later, court jailed four persons for murder and terrorism. The alleged perpetrators deny the act. This film is fiction about what could have happened that day, those hours before the tragedy stroke. Through the film we live the last day in the life of six youngsters. It is a reconstruction of Macedonian grim reality, not of the actual events. It is a film about a country where life can cease suddenly without a cause, as it is lived.
