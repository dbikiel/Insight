When a respectable middle-class couple take a cross-country trip by auto, they share expenses with a decidedly oddball couple, none of whom know the car carries embezzled funds.
The Whinneys share expenses for their trip to Hollywood with George and Gracie and thier Great Dane. A clerk in Whinney's bank has put fifty thousand dollars in a suitcase, hoping to rob Whinney on the road, but instead Whinney takes another road and is arrested in Nevada.
J. Pinkham Whinney, a conservative bank clerk, and Flora, his wife of twenty years are going on a second honeymoon, a long overland two week car trip to Hollywood which will limit them to only a day in Tinseltown. Flora makes the error of advertising for a carpooling couple in order to save expenses, and they end up with ditsy George Edward, his lightheaded girlfriend Grace, and their huge Mastiff. The three passengers cause no end of discomfort and annoyance to the Whinneys in their small car, In addition, "Pinky" is unknowingly transporting a suitcase filled with fifty thousand dollars embezzled from the bank, courtesy of one of his larcenous co-workers. Whinney unwittingly carries it cross-county until they reach Nevada and meet another dizzy couple, Sheriff John Hoxley, and the eccentric Mrs. K. Rumford.
