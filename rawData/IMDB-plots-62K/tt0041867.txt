A coyote and his rather dim son stalk the sheep that Pluto is guarding.
Pluto has a job in the Wild West as sheep dog. Guarding his flock proves a busy job when the coyote Bent-tail and his inexperienced son Bent-tail junior, who proves more of a bother then a help for dad, are determined to do what comes naturally to their species, hunting themselves a healthy diet of juicy meat, such as mutton, even if it takes some modern methods to get passed their distant canine cousin.
