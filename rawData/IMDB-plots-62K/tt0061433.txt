In 17th century Italy, a Spanish prince, who's searching for a bride, falls in-love with a beautiful local peasant girl.
A wonderful fairy tale of the misadventures of a beautiful but temperamental Neapolitan peasant, Isabella, when she meets the ill- tempered Spanish Prince Rodrigo Ferrante y Davalos. The King of Spain has ordered Rodrigo to choose a wife among seven Italian Princesses, but he is smitten by the lowly peasant. With the help of both witches and saints, Isabella conquers the heart of her Prince after many amusing events--including an outrageous dishwashing contest of the peasant against the Princesses.
