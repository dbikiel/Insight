Hapless driving instructor and former Gunnery Sergeant Rafferty, living in squalor near Hollywood, California, doesn't put up too much of a fight when two ladies hitch a ride and attempt to kidnap him in their attempt to get to New Orleans; while initially put off, Rafferty finds he's charmed by the kooky pair of misfits and the three of them drive to Las Vegas, Nevada and later Tucson, Arizona, where their bond eventually unravels.
Rafferty, a bourbon-swilling road examiner with the Hollywood branch of the DMV, doesn't take much pride in his life. While on a liquid lunch break in a city park, he meets two women traveling together: free-spirited aspiring country singer McKinley - Mac - and her fifteen year old belligerent and angry companion, who calls herself Frisbee. Although initially against his will, Rafferty agrees to drive the pair to their stated destination of New Orleans in his junk heap of a sedan, only knowing a brief outline of their life: how they met and why they're going to New Orleans. He does so largely in his attraction to Mac. Along the away, the trio get into one misadventure after another as they orchestrate one scam after another to finance their trip. But as their trip was initiated by Fris, their collective plans may change based on what is waiting for them, or more precisely what isn't waiting for them in New Orleans.
