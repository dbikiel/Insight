A struggling painter is possessed by satanic forces after he and his young family move into their dream home in rural Texas, in this creepy haunted-house tale.
Metal music, paint, and family are the passions of struggling painter, Jesse, who lives a happy life with his wife, and daughter. Things look brighter when Jesse's finds a huge old house, in rural Texas, selling at a very low price, due to its mysterious past. They move in and Jesse converts the barn into a studio, But soon, his work starts taking on a new, darker flavour - and things get even more ominous when the hulking, unbalanced son of the former owners, appears on the doorstep. Jesse's family won't be safe until they find a way to quiet the Devil himself.
Hellish visions fan the flame of Jesse, an artist who works on commission, since he, his wife and daughter moved to a house in Texas. Unbeknownst to them, there's a dark force strongly pulsating inside it, and, it's creeping into Jesse's mind. As the line between passion and madness gradually fades and the dictated nightmarish imagery makes it impossible to harness the artist's newfound creativity, Jesse's got to choose; his family, or his creativity - and the madness which comes with it.
