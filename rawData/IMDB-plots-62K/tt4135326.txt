Based on a true story, Lane is a 13-year-old girl coming of age on a Northern California commune in the 1970s. While Lane enjoys the freedom of living off-the-grid with her mother and younger siblings, she craves a stable "normal" life - a life she's only seen in pictures from a stolen Sears catalog. Lane must navigate her troubled mother, Hallelujah, while trying to care for her younger brother and sister. After a series of dangerous and isolating events, Lane decides to forge her own path in hopes of finding a better life after it becomes clear her family has fallen apart.
Based on Clane Hayward's memoir The Hypocrisy of Disco, LANE 1974 is the luminous, enigmatic journey of a teenage girl trying to survive an American counterculture. It's 1974. 13-year-old Lane lives on a beautiful Northern California commune, wild and free, until her mother, a rebel and iconoclast, alienates their small group from the security and safety of the community land. They begin moving from one unlikely situation to another, leaving normal life far behind.
