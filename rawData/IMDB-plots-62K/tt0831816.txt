Sangli-based Shiva Kumar re-locates to Mumbai to live with his brother, Daksh; Bhabi, Manasi; and their son. He gets recruited as a Sub-Inspector with Mumbai Police, and Manasi hopes that he will accept Haftas like other police officers so that they can improve their standard of living. Instead, Shiva befriends a rebel journalist from Daily News Analysis (D.N.A.), Sandhya Joshi, who is determined to expose the nexus between the police and the underworld; and incurs the wrath of his superiors as well as a former underworld don, Bappu, who is now an influential politician. After apprehending a vicious killer, Kutney, from Malaysia, Shiva is summoned by Home Minister, Manohar Shirke - and it is this meeting that will alter Shiva's life forever.
