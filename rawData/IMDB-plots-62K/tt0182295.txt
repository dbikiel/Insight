An update of the classic Shakespeare story, director Sir Kenneth Branagh shot this movie like a classic 1930s musical. This movie tells the story of four best friends who swear off love.
The King of Navarre and his three companions swear a very public oath to study together and to renounce women for three years. Their honor is immediately put to the test by the arrival of the Princess of France and her three lovely companions. It's love at first sight for all concerned followed by the men's highly entertaining, but hopeless efforts to disguise their feelings.
A Sir Kenneth Branagh written and directed adaptation of the Shakespeare play. Set in World War II, the King of Navarre and his three best friends have sworn off wine, women, and song for three years, in the interests of studying. But then, the beautiful Princess of France, and her equally-lovely ladies-in-waiting arrive, and their oaths are quickly and sorely tested.
