Sean Kane is an undercover police officer assigned to the Narcotics division of the San Francisco Police Department. In the beginning of the movie, there is an undercover operation, involving an informant, and things go sour when Norris' partner is killed. He resigns from the S.F.P.D., after his partner and his partner's wife, a television news reporter, are murdered. Unknowingly to Kane, is that the assignment, on which he was working undercover, was connected to a smuggling operation involving the Chinese Triad, and the deaths of his partner and his partner's wife are connected to an investigative report that involved the smuggling operation. In this movie, Chuck Norris goes beyond the law and goes after those responsible for the deaths of his partner and his partner's wife.
