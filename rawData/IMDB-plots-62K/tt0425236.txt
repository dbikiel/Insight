The Virgin Mary delivers a message to an 11-year-old girl.
Three characters linked by the mythical Maria Maddalena - Mary Magdalene... Tony Childress, an infamous, egotistical and obsessive actor/director is playing the lead role of Jesus in his controversial new film THIS IS MY BLOOD. When the shoot wraps, Marie Palesi, his lead actress, is left alone in Jerusalem, drained, empty. 'Selfless'. Into the void within her is poured the spirit of Mary Magdalene, and Marie embarks on a profound journey towards enlightenment. Meanwhile, in New York City, tv journalist Ted Younger begins his own quest for spiritual truth through his documentary about the life of Christ. When the premiere of Tony's film becomes the target of bomb threats by the vengeful religious Right, the lives and paths of these three characters come dramatically together.
After the conclusion of the shooting of the polemic movie "This Is My Blood" about the life of Jesus performing the role of Maria Magdalene, the successful actress Marie Palesi feels obsessed by the life of her character and decides to stay in Jerusalem in a quest of faith and self-knowledge to fulfill the emptiness of her life. The selfish and egocentric director Tony Childress returns to New York, where he meets the atheist host of a famous TV show Ted Younger in the prescreening of his movie. Ted is presenting a series of programs about the life of Jesus Christ and invites Tony to participate as a guest in his show. Meanwhile, Ted has one night stand with Tony's assistant and his upset wife Elizabeth Younger has problems with her pregnancy having an early delivery. When the desperate Ted sees the pain of his wife and his premature newborn son, he regrets and feels the need to pray for his beloved family.
