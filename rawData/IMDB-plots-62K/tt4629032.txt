An unfulfilled sergeant, is during WW2, leading a small Soviet anti aircraft outpost with only women soldiers under his command. German special forces are spottet in the woods and the sergeant with five of his women, set out to stop the Nazis, before they reach their mission goal! During all this, there are memory recaps, showing the band of six's earlier story and how they got to be where they are!
It is late spring of 1942, and the Great Patriotic War is in full swing. A long way off from the front-line, at some God-forgotten junction, the Germans make an air landing operation in an attempt to get through to the Kirov railway and the White Sea - the Baltic Sea Canal. These aren't just ordinary paratroopers. This is a team of seasoned and highly trained infiltrators, the elite of the Waffen-SS, superhumans. The only thing in their way is an anti-aircraft artillery unit of corporal Vaskov and five young women in training. It may seem like a fight of local significance, but the countrys main strategic transportation artery is at stake. Can the corporal and his 'petite newbies' prevent Nazi sabotage and at what cost?
