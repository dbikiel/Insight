Ill-advised by a pal, a chemistry professor falsely claims he is an undercover FBI agent in order to cover-up his marital infidelity but his lie, although swallowed by his wife, gets him in trouble with the real FBI, the CIA and the KGB.
In order to get back into the good graces with his wife with whom he has had a misunderstanding, a young chemistry professor concocts a wild story that he is an undercover FBI agent. To help him with his story he enlists the aid of a friend who is a TV writer. The wife swallows the story and later real FBI agents and enemy spies become involved in the scheme.
Sarah Alexander catches her straight-laced husband, Columbia University Assistant Professor of Chemistry Randy Alexander, kissing another woman. From Russ's perspective, he was the one being kissed innocently, the woman in question being a grateful transfer student. However, Ann wants a divorce. On the advice of Randy's friend, TV writer Mike Haney who is a self-professed libertine, Terry tries to convince Sarah that he is really an FBI agent, the kiss all in the name of national security. David, with the help of Mike's prop friend, even gets a fake ID and gun. The ruse works. But Sarah, excited about her husband's secret life, may not be able to keep her husband's occupation a secret. And the real FBI get wind that a fake ID has been made. They may be able to use Randy to their advantage. But if someone like Ann believes her husband is an FBI agent, others, such as foreign spies, may believe so as well.
