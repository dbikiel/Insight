A young American archaeological apprentice (Charvet) is drawn into a perilous expedition deep beneath the timeless sands of Egypt. Escaping death traps and ancient monsters, the expedition discovers a secret older than history, and a danger beyond imagination. The "sleepers" have awoken. The gods have arisen. And, the countdown to the end of the world has begun...
In Egypt, Prof. Hayden Masterton organizes an expedition to a pyramid to witness an event that takes place only once every 5000 years. But he needs to buy a key from a local dealer that will awaken aliens from outer space that are hidden inside the pyramid. However the treasure hunter Peter Levitz kills the dealer with Masterton's walking stick and steals the key; then he blackmails Masterton to participate in the expedition. When the team breaks in the pyramid, they find deadly traps and only a few will survive and Masterton uses the blood of his own daughter to activate a system to awaken the aliens. Will Earth be doomed to an apocalypse?
