An oddly naive man-child stalks his childhood best friend and tries to reconnect with their past.
Buck is a man-child who has lived his existence in a life of Romper Room, kindergarten collages, and lollipops. When his mother dies suddenly, Buck remembers his old childhood friend Chuck, with whom he feels a need to reconnect after having invited him to his mother's funeral. Buck treks out to Los Angeles where Chuck, an up-and-coming music record executive, is living his life. Buck ends up developing an obsession with Chuck and begins stalking him.
Chuck and Buck were best friends when they were young. Chuck grew up, and Buck didn't. When his mother dies, Buck invites Chuck (who mostly goes by Charlie now) to the funeral. He wants to be Chuck's best friend again, but Charlie is busy working and preparing for his wedding. Buck moves to Los Angeles and tries to revive the old friendship. He also writes a play, and hires Beverly to direct it. Charlie and his fiancée Carlyn stop returning Buck's calls, but he persists.
Chuck and Buck were best friends growing up until Chuck moved away when he was 11. Sixteen years later, Chuck (now Charlie) is a successful music executive, but Buck is still has the emotional maturity of an 11-year-old. When Buck's mother dies, he looks up Charlie, whom he hasn't seen since they were kids, and initiates a relationship. Charlie is embarrassed by Buck's emotional immaturity and tries to cut off all contact. Shattered by this rejection, Buck stalks Charlie and his fiancée Charlyn until Charlie is forced to re-examine their childhood relationship.
