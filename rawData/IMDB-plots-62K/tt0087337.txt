Sir Paul McCartney's recording of his new album is complicated by the fact that the master tapes of his recordings are missing.
Sir Paul McCartney plays himself in another exaggerated "Day In the Life". Included are fictional scenes of the star preparing to film two videos, rehearsing in a loft, playing for the BBC, and even dreaming up a rather horrific nightmare. A loosely developed plot about missing master tapes ties all of these events together.
Wow! its actually quite good - Basically, if the Album Master Tape (valued at Â£5million in 1984!!) doesn't turn up by midnight the company gets taken over. Oddly, Paul spends the rest of the day recording some tracks for the album, making some music videos at Elstree Studios, Radio promo &amp; rehearsals - Basically, its an excuse for back to back music videos :-D Some very interesting stuff, apart from his music. Look out for (Sir) George Martin, a working Battersea Power Station(!), Natwest Tower in the London skyline and the state that Broad Street station was in in 1984!! Probably best suited for hardcore McCartney fans :-)
