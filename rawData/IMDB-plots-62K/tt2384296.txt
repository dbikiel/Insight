"Funny For A Girl," Jay's newest one hour special, and the first in over 7 years, is the hilarious telling of stories of the challenges of raising two kids, keeping his family on the right path, along with his legendary impressions (Christopher Walken, Norm MacDonald, Adam Sandler and a host of others), and his hilarious real life stories in Hollywood. As Jay says, "the stories are all true" and they are all funny too.
