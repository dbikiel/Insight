This film explores the controversy surrounding autism advocacy from the perspectives of members of the autism communities.
Autism Speaks has been draining autism communities of funds and resources over the course of many years. "Citizen Autistic" is the first documentary to explore the controversies provoked by the organization's so-called advocacy by giving voice to some of the most articulate members of the communities it claims to represent. Director William Davenport exposes the ways Autism Speaks relies on propaganda and myths to fund its genetic research without considering families touched by autism. Interviews feature Ari Ne'eman of The Autistic Self Advocacy Network, Landon Bryce of thAutcast, artist/author Robyn Steward and autism activist Zoe Gross. Among issues they raise: Are self-diagnosed adults truly on the spectrum or are they manufacturing a malady? What causes divisions between parents of children on the spectrum and adults with autism/Aspergers? Why do members of autism communities respond with horror to what The Judge Rotenberg Center calls therapy? The overarching question of the film is whether Autism Speaks truly represents the authentic concerns of autism communities.
