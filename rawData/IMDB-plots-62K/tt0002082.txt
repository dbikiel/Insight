In this latter day Cain and Abel story, a jealous brother strikes down his sibling just as a young burglar is about to enter the house. The jealous brother summons police, who then charge the young intruder with murder. How can the burglar prove his innocence?
Perhaps no two subjects have concerned both judiciary circles and public alike more than the third degree and circumstantial evidence. The justice of their use in convicting a victim has always been an open question. While this subject takes no side in the matter and leaves the question still unsolved, it attempts to present the situation as it is in vivid, logical portrayal, and perchance may cause the more thoughtful to consider whether these principles, as carried out, work for the common good. The youth of the story passes through both ordeals. Truth is brought to light and the strong arm of the law foreseen.
