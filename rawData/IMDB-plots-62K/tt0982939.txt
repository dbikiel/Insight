An investigate crime reporter meets at a hotel for a taped interview with a big time gangster who has turned state's witness and says that he's started a new, legitimate life. What the gangster doesn't know is that a bomb that he planted to kill a fellow gangster accidentally killed the reporter's pregnant wife years ago, and the reporter isn't about to reveal this to the gangster until the time is right.
