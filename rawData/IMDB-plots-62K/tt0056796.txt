Candace Hull, the 16-year-old daughter of American diplomat John Hull, in London, is a classmate and friend of many other daughters of diplomats from various countries, and gets invited to lots of social affairs. While visiting Mai-ling, niece of the Red Chinese ambassador she stumbles into a major political secret, involving a murder. Secretly,she passes this information to a CIA agent, Wally Sanders, on whom she has a crush.
