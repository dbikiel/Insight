The true story of the murder of Damilola Taylor - a ten year old Nigerian boy living in Peckham, London - and the subsequent trial.
The shocking death of ten-year-old Damilola Taylor in 2000 saw an innocent schoolboy lose his life on the streets of London. In front of the world's media, his parents embarked on a grueling path to find justice - but behind closed doors, how could their love survive such private grief?
In August 2000 British-educated Richard Taylor, an official in the Nigerian ministry in Lagos, is opposed to his wife Gloria taking their ten year old son Damilola to London, along with older brother Tunde and sister Gdeni, who needs treatment for her epilepsy, but ultimately gives in. Gloria and her children, having been denied a council house, live with an aunt on a rough estate and Damolola is bullied at school but finds an outlet in the local library's computer club. One November afternoon Damolola is stabbed and left to die and when Richard arrives in England he is angry with the family, especially Tunde for not protecting his brother. Ultimately two brothers are convicted and sent to youth custody but it takes several years for Richard, channelling his rage into establishing a charitable trust for underprivileged youngsters, to reunite with the family at Tunde's graduation. A final credit reveals a grim statistic.
This gripping BBC drama tells the story of Damilola Taylor, a young African schoolboy who moved to England with his family to start a new life, and who was cruelly killed by a group of youths. His senseless death leads his parents on a quest for justice.
