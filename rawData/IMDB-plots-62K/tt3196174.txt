In order to take down a major criminal organization, the ambitious head of the internal affairs unit of the Reykjavik P.D. decides to investigate a corrupt police lieutenant. Tipped off about the lieutenant's criminal dealings by a former crime kingpin, now imprisoned, he places a female former narcotics officer undercover to spy on him. These actions set him off on a dangerous path as he aims to catch both the lieutenant and the drug lord.
From the director of "City State" comes BRAVE MEN'S BLOOD, a crime thriller set against the background of corruption, drugs, torture and Icelandic gangsters. When a former criminal kingpin tips off the head of Internal Affairs about the double-dealings of a high-profile police lieutenant, the ensuing investigations leads them deep into the seedy underworld of Reykjavik, where corruption and collusion run rampant, and no one is who they seem to be.
