A pretty, young girl from a coal-mining town comes to Moscow with dreams of becoming a supermodel in this satirical look at the fashion industry.
Contempory Moscow, Russia. Young Galya (Yuliya Vysotskaya) comes to Moscow from the coal-mining town of Shakhty in the Rostov Oblast near the Black Sea, a journey of over 500 miles. She is pretty and bright, if a bit naive and disorganized. Her dream is to become an elite high-fashion model -- a supermodel -- and to see her image on the glossy cover of the fashion magazine Beauty. When she meets the editor-in-chief of Beauty Magazine, however, he tells Galya that she lacks the necessary natural beauty and sense of style to be a model, and she will never appear on their cover. She then goes to work as a seamstress for a famous fashion designer. During one of their shows, quite by accident, she ends up walking the runway as a model. They fire her on the spot. Then, seemingly by chance, she becomes the assistant of the owner of an elite, highly exclusive, personal matchmaking agency, which -- for a considerable price -- arranges marriages for rich men with the most beautiful models in Moscow. Soon, she, too, will learn how to be an "elitnaya nevesta (elite bride)".
