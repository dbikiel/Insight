This is the story of the Tokyo Trial - the international military tribunal that opened in May of 1946 to prosecute the Japanese leaders for war crimes. It was supposed to dot the I's and cross the T's, just like the Nuremberg Trial did for Nazi Germany. But instead, it ended up in a tangled mess.

The Tokyo Trial - the International Military Tribunal for the Far East - had been convened in 1946 to prosecute the leaders of the Empire of Japan for war crimes.

The Tokyo trial was decided upon by the Allies to avenge these decades of misery and death; and accepted by many Japanese as a way to move on. The main charge leveled against the 28 political and military leaders was 'Crime against Peace', defined as a criminal conspiracy to wage a war of aggression. A charge already tried and tested at Nuremberg. It would prove to be divisive from the start, contributing to split the 11 judges into two opposing camps.
