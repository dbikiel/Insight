The story of serial killer Ted Bundy.
Docu-drama based on the life of Ted Bundy, a serial killer who killed at least 19 young women during the 1970's (though some sources say as many as 30 to 35 were murdered). Set from his college student years, to his first victims, his capture, escape from prison (twice), his final killing spree to his trial, conviction and execution.
Ted Bundy was the good guy. Charasmatic, handsome, charming, intelligent, and the nicest guy you'd ever met. But beneath that good guy exterior was a vicious serial killer who caused havoc and terror among the citizens of the United States in the 1970s. This is the true story of how this respected man became one of America's most notorious serial killers.
Michael Reilly Burke's portrayal of the notorious serial killer Ted Bundy is exceptional. This account begins in 1974 with Bundy as a sympathetic counselor at an emergency hotline center in Seattle as well as a struggling law student. Bundy was handsome, intelligent, and well spoken, but something disturbing lurked just beneath the facade and his sociopathic behavior set forth a series of events that would shock the world. "Ted Bundy" moves from the 1974 Seattle killings to Utah, Colorado, and to his final killing spree in Tallahassee, Florida shortly after he escaped (for the second time) from incarceration and ends with his humiliating demise in the electric chair on January 24th, 1989. Theodore Robert Bundy confessed to killing 28 women, but the actual number Bundy carried with him to his grave. Some say, however, that he is responsible for as many as 33 to 100 murders of young women.
