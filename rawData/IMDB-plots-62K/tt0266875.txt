Mini shifts to her new house along with her parents Mr. and Mrs. Shrma, as well as, nephew Bunty. Bunty finds a cat in the backyard of the house and gets attracted to it but the cat soon dies when it accidentally comes under the wheels of Mr. Sharma. They bury it without Bunty's knowledge. However, Bunty finds soon another cat of same resemblance which gives the family a shock. Mini is in love with Deepak once when their bike tire goes flat, Deepak goes to change and upon returning he finds Mini weeping besides a pond with redness in her eyes. She pushes Deepak in the pond but next moment she is normal again. Mini's friend, Rashmi also gets inexplicably killed and her neck is twisted backwards. While cops suspect Mini to be behind it when she twists the neck of her doll in a similar way, the strange events lead Mr Sharma to take professional from a psychiatrist. Mrs Sharma though is sure her daughter is possessed and takes help of an exorcist Sharji.
The Sharma family re-locate to a semi-urban locality in a house that has a "reputation". The Sharma family consists of Mr. Sharma (Akash Khurana), his wife Shalini Sharma (Rohini Hattangadi), only daughter Manisha Sharma (Revathi) or "Mini" as they affectionately call her; and their grandchild Bunty (Master Ateet), as his parents had been killed in an accident. Strange things start happening, with a return of a dead kitten, and the brutal murder of Manisha's friend, Reshmi (Jaya Mathur); an attempt to kill Mr. Sharma and Manisha's boyfriend, Deepak (Kushant). What is the force behind these brutalities? Is it natural or supernatural?
