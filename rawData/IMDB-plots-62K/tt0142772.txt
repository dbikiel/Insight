Polish deceived woman hides from pimps on a Dutch farm, and shares an intriguing romance with the farmer.
Drama on the dawning love between a Polish woman and a farmer from Groningen. Anna is forced to work in a brothel, but manages to escape. She's found, exhausted and scared, by Henk (the farmer) who offers her a place to stay, but her past chases her.
Polish girl Anna flees the brothel to which she has been taken under false pretenses. Her flight (on foot) takes her to a farm in the countryside where she is taken up by bachelor farmer Henk Woldring. Their developing relationship (chiefly helped along by Anna's good humor and enterprising personality, and a copy of 'How do I say it in Polish?') makes up the main storyline. The brothel owner and his flunky, Henk's unforthcoming bank and Anna's daughter in Poland mix in elements of tension.
