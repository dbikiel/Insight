Four heavily armed hitmen and two unusual teenagers go to war over $500,000 of stolen cash.
When out-on-bail mob boss Bellavance discovers that $500,000 of his money is missing, he sends four hardcore hit men to send a "loud and messy" message to the suspected thieves' families. But when the killers invade the Rutledge home, they'll meet the household's emotionally disturbed young son Owen. Owen has a history of violent behavior, knows how to make lethal booby-traps and is about to teach these thugs some deadly lessons in extreme vengeance.
This movie is about a newly bailed mob boss named Bellavance (Ray Wise) and his band of hit men (including Derek Mears- 'Jason Voorhees') who head off to find $500,000 that has gone missing. They take out anybody that has come in contact with the money, but they eventually track down a family that they believe have the money. They don't realize that the son (Owen) has been involved in some unsavory incidents as a result of his "Aggression". They are soon to find out just who and what they're up against.
