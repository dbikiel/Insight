Inept Salman comes to help his sister-in-law tend to his holy terror nephews while Salman's brother is off fighting in Iraq. Salman must take a humiliating job as a giant blue corporate mascot in order to help make ends meet and hold the family together.
A jittery bundle of uncertainty, Salman is the last person his sister-in-law Leslie wants to turn to for support. But with a husband in Iraq, two unbelievably unruly kids underfoot, and the fear of losing her benefits if she doesn't return to work, she's got no choice. So when Salman arrives on her doorstep, willing to help but woefully ill-equipped, he's less her salvation than a personification of everything that's gone wrong with her life. As the situation at home worsens, Salman lands a job at a moribund dot-com as their giant blue corporate mascot and soon discovers that having a secret identity - even a ridiculously impractical one - has its advantages.
