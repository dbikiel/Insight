A veteran tries to put his life back together, but is drawn to deeds that may be more dangerous than his tour of duty.
Following an extended tour of duty in the Middle East, a veteran returns home only to face new enemy. Battling insomnia &amp; undiagnosed post traumatic stress disorder, he finds a job as a projectionist working the night shift at a decrepit theater. As he struggles to adapt to civilian life, he quickly finds himself tangled in an inescapable web of seduction, addiction, &amp; violence. His disdain for those around him reaches a boiling point and he embarks on a new war against society, vowing to take drastic action against it in an attempt to defend the country he loves.
