Dr. Reineger is a child neuro-psychologist who has become confident that the twin Anna has a form of autism called Asperger's Syndrome, rendering her unable to cope with reality. As for her blind sister, Sarah, the Doctor cannot say for sure why her visions map so closely to Anna's. At home, their father leaves the family. To escape the pain, the girls sink deeper and deeper into their imaginations. When a major earthquake takes their mother's life, Reineger is left with helping the now-orphaned twins cope, while at the same time dealing with his own struggle concerning the girls' prophetic visions. The girls escape the institution. The subsequent search party can't track them. Have they indeed transcended the physical realm?
Dr. Reineger is a child neuro-psychologist who has dealt with extreme and abnormal cases his entire life. But one particular case, that of Anna Woodruff, a candidate for Asperger's Syndrome, leaves the doctor perplexed when he learns of her identical twin sister Sarah and their intense connection. After bringing them both in for testing, the doctor is amazed at the results: the twins seem to unify in another realm, that of vision and imagination. But when these visions begin to cross over into reality, the troubled doctor must confront his own beliefs in what science can explain, and consider the unknown. The events which follow are so astonishing that they bring Dr. Reineger to a stand still: either accept the prophesy of the twins, or abandon his practice. But before he can decide, the institutionalized girls escape. The conclusion and findings are silencing: have the girls transcended reality itself?
