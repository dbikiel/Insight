Tom Campbell joined the US army after breaking up with Chelsea, who meanwhile became mayor of his coastal California home town. Tom returns to the town to run his grandmother's B&amp;B "Cupid's" while she's in hospital, hoping to become a professional bodyguard afterward with his army buddy Steve. However, his grandmother dies. Saving her legacy proves a nightmare, as she delayed crucial repairs and has enormous tax arrears. The regional tycoon's ambitious son Jerry, Chelsea's fianc√©, bids on the B&amp;B because he knows about a planned road which would make it a perfect mall location. Tom falls in love with the local girl, who is about to succeed his kinsman Kip Caldwell as chief of police.
