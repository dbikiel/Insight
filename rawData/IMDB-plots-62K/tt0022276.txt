Marion is a factory worker who hopes to trade the assembly line, for a beautiful penthouse apartment. Mark Whitney, a wealthy and influential lawyer can make her dreams come true, but there is only one problem, he will give her everything but a marriage proposal. Will this affair ever lead to marriage?
Wealthy New York lawyer Mark Whitney and wealthy divorced socialite Marian Moreland are constant companions in a romantic relationship. The few in the know are aware that Marian is really Marian Martin, a factory girl from Erie PA, who Mark met three years earlier. Marian came to New York on a chance and was up front with Mark that her goal was to marry a rich man to get her out of her poverty. Back at home, Marian had been dating fellow factory worker Al Manning, who wanted to marry her. She turned down his several marriage proposals since she didn't want to get stuck in a life of poverty. Mark was attracted to her beauty and her forthrightness with him. As such, he provided her with all the material wealth she now has as well as opportunity to become well bred on the surface. But stung once by marriage, Mark has no plans ever to marry Marian. The made up back story of she being a divorc√©e living comfortably on alimony was devised by Mark to give her some respectability. Regardless, they are in love with each other. Their stable life changes when Al, now making his mark in the world, comes to New York for work. Al would still like to marry Marian, he knowing nothing about Marian and Mark's arrangement. She knowing Mark is a benefit for him as Mark is able to provide Al a foot in the door for the work project in question. A further obstacle in Marian and Mark's relationship is that he is asked to run for governor. The truth about Marian being his kept woman would kibosh any chance of an election win.
