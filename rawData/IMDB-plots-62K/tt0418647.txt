Cale Crane catalyzes the rescue and rehabilitation of Sonador, a race horse with a broken leg.
Ben Crane believes that a severely injured racehorse deserves another chance. He and his daughter Cale adopt the horse (in fact is a mare)and save it of being sacrificed by the owner. The arrival of the mare to Crane's farm, will be the perfect opportunity for both father and daughter to reconstruct their lost familiar bond. "Soñador" (Dreamer in English), the renamed mare, despite its broken leg, maybe could have another chance to return to the racecourse, with the help of Cale, Ben, and his father, Pop.
In Lexington, Kentucky, the horse barn of the Crane family has been empty for years due to the financial difficulties of the family. When the mare Sonya, a.k.a. Soñador (Dreamer, in English), breaks a foreleg in a race Palmer, the owner, decides to put her down. To save her life, Ben Crane accepts the injured horse instead of the three month's salary owed by Palmer. His daughter Cale becomes emotionally connected with Sonya, and while the horse is being rehabilitated, the wounds in the Crane family are also healed. Soñador is given one more chance at racing, in hopes of saving the family's property from foreclosure.
A down-and-out horse trainer is given an equally broken-down, but once great racehorse, as severance pay. It will take the unwavering faith and determination of his daughter to bring these two damaged souls together in a quest to win the Breeder's Cup Classic.
