Dr. Maurice Lamar is a noted plastic-surgeon who makes his rich clients beautiful, and also makes them. He makes Eve Caron, the wife of Marcel Caron, so satisfied with his skilled hands that she leaves Marcel and marries Maurice. They go on a Mediterranean honeymoon, where he soon finds the affects of his own beauty regulations are more than he can handle. He bids adieu to his new bride, wings it back to Paris with the intention of giving up his practice and becoming a scientific researcher...after winning back the love of his simple, unadorned secretary, Anne.
What we would today call a plastic surgeon is having a great life in Paris. On his staff--the jewel of the staff--is a plain and simple girl who loves this doctor (Cary Grant) madly, but of course he doesn't see this and preserves his attention for the many beautiful patients who flock to his office. One is the wife of a man who greatly regrets his wife's year-long quest to better her once delightful naturalness, and of course she sets her sights on the good doctor.Hijinx ensue. There are many divorces and marriages. And lovely ladies. And then it turns out all right in the end.
