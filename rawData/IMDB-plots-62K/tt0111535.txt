The 1960's: Martine lives with her mother in a Parisian suburb near an American military base. At age 14, she has only one idea in her head: to lose her virginity. Her mother lets her go to a local dance one night providing that her elder brother, Alain accompanies her. Martine and her closest friend Marlene manage to elude Alain. Then, disappointed by the evening, they meet up with Alain again in another villa where boys and girls are all relaxed. Martine does not reply to any advances. The next day she realizes that Marlene and Alain spent the night together.
