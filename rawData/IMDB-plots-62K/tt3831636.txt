After meeting online, Jack and Kristy go on a weekend getaway to the woodlands of rural Missouri. While discovering each other, they soon learn of the terrorizing horrors that the forest has in store.
A dive into the deep waters of classic horror films updated with novel, unanticipated plot twists. The film blends legendary horror actors (Jewel Shepard, RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD and R.A. Mihailoff, TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE III) with fresh faces on the film scene (Ben Kaplan, Morgan Carter, and Rebecca Crowley). Hazards of modern technology lead the characters into a dark, remote, isolated backwoods far away from the trappings and safety of suburbia or city life. There they encounter a family like no other.
