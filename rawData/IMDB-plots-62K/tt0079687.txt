A young American man joins the IRA in Ireland but soon finds out that he is being used for political purposes and propaganda.
Idealistic Vietnam veteran Michael Flaherty (Wasson), enthralled by the stories told to him by his grandfather (Hayden) and disillusioned by the lack of a clear cut cause in Vietnam, leaves his comfortable life in a Detroit suburb and goes to Ireland to fight for the IRA, only to discover that nothing is ever clear cut.
