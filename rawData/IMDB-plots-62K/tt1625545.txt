Hamtaro has been having a recurring dream where a beautiful princess hamster asks for help and he can't forget about her, even when he's awake. One day, Laura tells him that everyone in the family is going to her father's hometown. When Hamtaro tells his friends about it, Maxwell pulls out a book on old hamster history that says there is a "homeland" for hamsters called "Hamja Kingdom". When the Ham-Hams build a sand castle and recite a spell as it is written in the book they are whooshed to the Kingdom, where they run into old enemies and new ones and have to save the princess.
