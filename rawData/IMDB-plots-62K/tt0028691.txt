A Portuguese fisherman rescues a young boy from the sea after he fell from an ocean liner. The boy is the son of a railway tycoon and privileged life and attitudes are quickly challenged by life on a fishing boat in the North Atlantic. This pre-WW2 movie based on the story by Rudyard Kipling and stars Freddie Bartholomew as the 15 year old boy, Harvey, and Spencer Tracey as the Portuguese fisherman, Manuel, that rescues him. Learning the work ethic, hardships and superstitions of the Gloucester-men Harvey soon becomes part of the crew and the close friend of the paternalistic Manuel.
