When the head of a statue sacred to a village is stolen, a young martial artist goes to the big city and finds himself taking on the underworld to retrieve it.
Booting lives in a small and peaceful village. One day a sacred Buddha statuette called Ong Bak is stolen from the village by an immoral businessman. It soon becomes the task of a voluntary young man, Boonting (Phanom Yeeram), to track down the thief in Bangkok and reclaim the religious treasure. Along the way, Boonting uses his astonishing athleticism and traditional Muay Thai skills to combat his adversaries.
When the head of Ong-Bak, the sacred Buddha of a poor village, is stolen, the population falls into misery. The Buddha was the focal point of an anniversary vigil believed to bring rain to the drought-stricken area. Young Ting volunteers to travel to Bangkok and retrieve the relic in time for their ceremony. Ting, trained in muay thai by monks who forbade him to use it in combat, must avoid the temptation to use it as he delves into the seedy underworld of a corrupt city.
