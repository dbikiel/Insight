Leonard Borland loves his monied wife, but with his wrecking business looking shaky he treasures her all the more. So when she decides to try again to become an opera singer he indulges her. While organising a concert for her he meets glamorous Cecil Carver. She in turn discovers Leonard has a splendid voice, and encourages him to use it for reasons very much her own.
Businessman Leonard Borland (Paul Douglas) cares little about music but indulges his wife Doris (Celeste Holm) in her ambition to be an opera star. He rents a concert hall and she pleases the friendly audience. In the course of "producing" the concert, he meets a real opera star, Celia Carver (Linda Darnell) who discovers that Borland has a marvelous baritone voice. She persuades him to to take lessons and he , using the name of Logan Bennett, proves a hit at rehearsals, but when he co-stars with her in an opera, he makes a fool of himself with his awkwardness.
