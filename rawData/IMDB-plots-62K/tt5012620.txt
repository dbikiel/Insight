An engaged couple's relationship unravels over the course of a particularly rocky New Year's Eve.
No Resolution explores the relationship of never-was musician, Cary, and his newly pregnant fianc√©, Jean, as they struggle with concepts of family and settling down. New Year's Eve becomes a fitting backdrop for the disparity of their combined future; Jean longs for a nice night staying in, but the temptations of a decadent evening are too much for Cary to avoid. The engaged couple reaches a boiling point of anger and resentment as their upstairs neighbors stoke the flames with a raging New Year's party.
