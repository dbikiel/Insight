A con artist moves her son to a conservative neighborhood in Oklahoma in an effort to build a better future, but it doesn't take long for her past to catch up with her, and for her son's behavior to cause problems of its own.
Bringing Up Bobby is the story of a European con-artist and her son Bobby, who find themselves in Oklahoma in an effort to escape her past and build a better future. Olive and Bobby blithely charm their way from one adventure to another until Olive's criminal past catches up with her. Consequently, she must make a choice: continue with a life of crime or leave the person she loves most in an effort to give Bobby a proper chance in life.
In an effort to escape her murky past and build a better future, Olive (Milla Jovovich), a nomadic European con-artist, and her 10-year-old American-born son, Bobby (Spencer List), find themselves living in Oklahoma. As her top priority, Olive seeks to give Bobby the things she never had: she enrolls him in school, makes him do his homework and tries her hardest to be a good mother, and with the help of an old friend from Oklahoma, Walt (Rory Cochrane), Olive "provides" for Bobby in the only way she knows how. But despite of her efforts (or perhaps because of them) Bobby displays troubling behavior both at his school and in their conservative neighborhood. Things take a turn for the worse after Bobby's unfortunate "run-in" with the local and wealthy businessman Kent (Bill Pullman), and Olive's criminal past finally catches up with her, forcing her to make the toughest judgment of all.
