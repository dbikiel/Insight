Funnyman George Lopez stars in this family misadventure as a dad who volunteers to chaperone his daughter's camping troop - unaware he'll be the only guy in a world of girls.
Lawyer Eddie Serrano is extremely busy, yet the widower tries to be there whenever his daughter Naomi needs parental support. When a parent volunteer from her scouts troop falls ill last moment, he volunteers to take her place during a field camp. Alas, it's run in military style by the tyrannical Miss Hulka, who can't appreciate Eddie's pragmatic approach. Nerdy Harry Matthews, who was supposed to stand in at the law firm, passes by with some papers but gets involved in the scheming which mainly opposes Naomi's troop and rival Skylar's.
