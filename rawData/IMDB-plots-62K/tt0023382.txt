The owner of a rubber plantation becomes involved with the new wife of one of his employees.
Conditions are spartan on Dennis Carson's Indochina rubber plantation during a dusty dry monsoon. The latest boat upriver brings Carson an unwelcome guest: Vantine, a floozy from Saigon, hoping to evade the police by a stay upcountry. But Carson, initially uninterested, soon succumbs to Vantine's ostentatious charms...until the arrival of surveyor Gary Willis, ill with malaria, and his refined but sensuous wife Barbara. Now the rains begin, and passion flows like water...
Dennis Carson runs a rubber plantation in Indo-China. Vantine is a prostitute running from the police when she arrives at the plantation and Carson must let her stay till the next boat arrives.
