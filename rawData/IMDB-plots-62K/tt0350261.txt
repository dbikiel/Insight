Desperate to provide care for her daughter, down-on-her-luck Jean moves in with her father in-law from whom she is estranged. Through time, they learn to forgive each other and heal old wounds.
To escape an abusive boyfriend, without announcing her plans in advance, Jean Gilkyson takes her young daughter Griff to the Wyoming ranch of her father-in-law, Einar. Jean and Einar are disaffected, as he blames her for the death of his son in a car accident. Einar is taking care of his friend Mitch, who was attacked by a bear, and Einar does not know that he has a granddaughter. While Mitch heals and forgives the bear, Einar also changes his feelings regarding Jean, finally understanding that accidents happen and accepting her and loving Griff.
Trying to escape her abusive boyfriend, widowed Jean, her daughter Griff in tow, takes refuge in the only place she feels she can hide in safety -- the Wyoming ranch of her estranged father-in-law, Einar. Einar, who did not know of his granddaughter's existence, does not welcome them, as he still blames Jean for the car accident that ended the life of his son (to whom Jean was married) twelve years earlier, but he allows them to stay for the month, enough time for Jean to earn enough money to move elsewhere. The strain between Jean and Einar increases as she quickly begins a sexual relationship with Sheriff Curtis, whom Griff dislikes solely because of that relationship. Einar's ranching partner Mitch, who is recovering from a bear mauling and who is now permanently disabled, is Einar's voice of reason in trying to convince him to establish a caring relationship with the only family he has left. Mitch's perspective is in part due to the attacking bear -- now captured and on display in town -- with which he has a special attachment.
