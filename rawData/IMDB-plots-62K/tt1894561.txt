A group of rodeo trick-riders recruits a young girl to join them.
"Cowgirls N' Angels" tells the story of Ida, a feisty and rebellious young girl, who has fantasies of finding her father, a rodeo rider. While searching for her dad, she connects with the Sweethearts of the Rodeo, a team of young female rodeo riders run by former rodeo star Terence Parker. Recognizing Ida's innate talent for trick riding, Terence recruits her for their ranks. Accepted wholeheartedly by her new "family," Ida finds a new passion that redefines her life -- and she also may find the father she's been searching for.
