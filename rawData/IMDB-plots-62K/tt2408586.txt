Growing Cities is a documentary film that examines the role of urban farming in America and asks how much power it has to revitalize our cities and change the way we eat.
In their search for answers, filmmakers Dan Susman and Andrew Monbouquette take a road trip and meet the men and women who are challenging the way this country grows and distributes its food, one vacant city lot, rooftop garden, and backyard chicken coop at a time. Join them as they discover that good food isn't the only crop these urban visionaries are harvesting. They're producing stronger and more vibrant communities, too.
Driven from their hometown by its poor health, the filmmakers set out to discover how other cities feed themselves. Along the way, they meet city dwellers fundamentally challenging the way this country produces food - from urban homesteaders trying to make ends meet to backyard gardeners fighting for their rights to grow food, they find city farming is about more than just good produce.
