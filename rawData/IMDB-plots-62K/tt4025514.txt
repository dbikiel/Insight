A gangster known as "Samurai" wants to turn the waterfront of Rome into a new Las Vegas. All the local mob bosses have agreed to work for this common goal. But peace is not to last long.
In 2011, Ostia is the subject of a giant real estate project intended to make the harbor of Ancient Rome the Las Vegas of today. But the place soon becomes a battlefield where criminals and politicians either join forces cynically or fight each other ruthlessly. The infernal showdown will last seven days, claiming many lives.
A gangster known as Samurai is putting together a deal to construct a Las Vegas-style casino complex in the harbour area of Rome. He has all the pieces put together - the land (through leaning on the former landowners), the funding (from wealthy mafia families), a politician to help the project get through red tape and change legislation where necessary, and peace within the different mafia families to enable the deal to go through smoothly. Then the politician gets caught in a compromising, potentially career-ending situation and things start to unravel. Samurai has to use all his contacts, negotiation and persuasion skills to keep things on track.
