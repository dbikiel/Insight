When a mythical device from ancient times is rebuilt by a group of Confederates who feel the Civil War never ended, Mickey Matson and his newfound friend, Sully, must follow a series of clues left by his dead grandfather to keep the evil men away from the three mystical objects that power the device. If he fails, it could mean not only the loss of his family's house, but maybe the demise of our country as we know it.
