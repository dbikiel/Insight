A junk man travels to Africa to find a rare metal-eating bird.
Charlie, working on a junkjard, always trying to help people in the most impossible ways with junk from his work place, hears from a German professor, that there is a bird, a Belgish Kongo, that eats metal. Charlie sets out on a ridiculous hunting expedition to catch one. With some music - the birds love music - and a strange worm he is able to catch one, but even then the bird offers some even more over-the-top surprises.
Charley Chucklehead is a junk man with a tall tale to end all tall tales. He relates his incredible story on the radio program of Lowell Thomas, Exalted Giraffe of the Tall Story Club. Charley's job is to get rid of car parts, a job he performs in a variety of creative ways. He replaces aquariums with gas tanks, carburetors for teacups, steering wheels for chairs, and so on. However, when he learns of a metal-eating bird in Africa, he sees a real chance for efficient junk disposal. The bird loves music, so off he goes to Africa with a brass band. Charley gets unexpected help from a worm, who is, so to speak, a tough bird.
