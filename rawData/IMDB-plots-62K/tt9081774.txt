With a single mistake, Rui, a former star basketball player, loses his job and has nothing to do. Collecting parking fees on the street, he's snooping around a dark world. He knows it is not where he belongs, but he has no place to go and nobody welcomes him. Then one day, he finds a woman bleeding on the street, and he takes her to the hospital. On the way, he is kidnapped by a bank robber. At first, he only looks for a chance to get away, but he is increasingly attracted to the robber who lives proudly, cleverly leading the underworld. Through him, a mentor and role model for the dark, Rui faces the brutal criminal nature hidden inside him. But the moment arrives when Rui can't avoid the final showdown with him.
