In a tiny kingdom, a goose herd girl seizes her chance for 'revenge' on royal heiress Elisabeth whose haughty entourage once humiliated the maiden by ordering her to fetch water for a drunk the princess didn't even want. Indeed she is part of the train with magic horse Florian when the princess is sent to her betrothed, king Gustav's studly son Leopold. Thus the maiden sheds the third of the queen's blood drops shed to protect the princess and forces her, by near-drowning, to accept an identity-swap.
