A scientist invents a filter that can increase the power of a laser beam, turning it into a death ray! A dangerous crime organization wants the device and will stop at nothing to get it, while murder and violence follow Joe and Tom to Singapore as they try to foil the evil plans.
Two agents come are hired to protect a scientist who has created a death ray with a 300-mile range! The evil Golden Dragon, along with his machinegun and whip-wielding babes, try to steal the power beam for evil purposes. There's an ancient torture chamber (run by the unruly babes) that Tony and Brad end up in! A great '60s spy-sci-fi movie.
Detective Jo Walker (Tony Kendall) and New York Police Captain Tom Rowland (Brad Harris) are sent to Singapore to protect Professor Akron (Ernst Fritz FÃ¼rbringer) and his latest invention - a laser filter than can be used to shut down electrical engines from miles away, which means a weapon of mass destruction if it falls in the wrong hands. But they are outnumbered in a number of fights with the baddies, and the Professor ends up the prisoner of the mysterious Golden Dragon. So, the new mission is more difficult: to rescue the Professor, protect his beautiful daughter, and safeguard the filter. The Golden Dragon proves to be very powerful, and commands a small army of gun-toting men, and whip-cracking women.
