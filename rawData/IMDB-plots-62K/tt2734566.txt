As the Bride and the Groom prepare for the wedding in the pale desert, a tale of unappeased desires; forbidden yearnings, and conflicted choices unfolds. Now, three lovers stand powerless before the true nature of man. Is fate unavoidable?
Based on "Bodas de sangre" by Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, tells the story of a love triangle between two men and a woman. Two lovers carried away by their passion defying all moral and social rules even challenging their own judgment. The same day of her wedding, the bride and her lover escape on horseback to live their love. Their disobedience will have devastating consequences.
Inseparable since childhood, the Bride and the Groom share a gentle but ardent passion that is stronger than the desolate and barren land that encircles them. Weak and irresolute, the fair Bride is due to marry the stalwart Groom; however, after all this time, Leonardo--an unconventional family man, and a mutual childhood friend--still feels the same achingly hopeless passion for the Bride. Now, as the Bride silently prepares for her wedding in the middle of the pale desert, the feeble flesh succumbs to the long-boiling anguish of the unappeased carnal desire, and three lovers stand powerless before the true nature of man. Is fate unavoidable?
