A family's Passover gets screwy after the patriarch unknowingly ingests a hit of Ecstasy.
When Do We Eat? is the story of the "world's fastest Passover Seder" gone horribly awry. It's about an old school dad who's as tough on his sons as his father is on him. On this night, however, one of the boys slips Dad a dose of special, hallucinogenic Ecstasy in order "to give him a new perspective." Meanwhile, Mom brings a handsome stranger to dinner and the kids take sides. By the end of the night, however, Dad's visions turn him into a modern day Moses intent on leading this hungry group to the promised land of family forgiveness. Of course they're all so stubborn, it would be easier to part the Red Sea.
The dysfunctional family of Ira and Peggy Stuckman is going to be together for Passover for the first time in three years. Convening for the "world's fastest Passover Seder" are Ira and Peggy's children: Zeke, a misunderstood druggie, Ethan, a failed entrepreneur turned Chasidic, Lionel, an autistic teen and Nikki, a sex therapist - plus their cousin Vanessa and their estranged, lesbian half-sister, Jennifer. Sound like a modern Ten Plagues? Throw in a one-eyed Israeli tent salesman, a meal "kosher enough for Moses" and one tablet of Ecstasy, and the stage is set for an evening of Biblical proportions. Will the mismatched collection of guests ever be a family? It would take a whole lot of kosher wine - and maybe a miracle...
