Reality movie of a few days in the life of a Czech teenager when he starts work.
Petr is 17 years old and starts work as a security worker against shoplifting in a busy self-service shop. His boss gives him pretty basic instructions, and Petr is pretty unsuccessful at work. He doesn't do much better at the dance hall either, and at home his bombastic father lectures him about how useless he is.
