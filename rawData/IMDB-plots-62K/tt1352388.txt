Mentally abused, enslaved and coerced into prostitution, a left-for-dead merciless Sister will take on a mission straight from God, whacking sinners in a strictly personal, no-prisoners vigilante Holy War.
Hazed from a drug overdose and brutally beaten, Sister Sarah will find herself in the middle of a bad trip, mentally abused, enslaved and coerced into prostitution for the evil and sleazy El Chavo's "Los Muertos" biker gang. Right on the brink of demise and totally abandoned by the pious merchants of dope, the left-for-dead Sister will take on a mission to put the fear of God into sinners and to persecute all those who stand against Him. So, without delay, prepared for vengeance while armed with God's tools and a heavy arsenal to do the Lord's work, merciless Sister Sarah will start whacking priests one-by-one in a strictly personal vigilante frenzy. After all, she is the Hand of God amid Holy War, where no one is spared and no prisoners are taken.
