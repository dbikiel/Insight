Based on Primo Levi's autobiographical "The Reawakening".
This is the true story of Italian Jews returning home from Auschwitz after the war. It deals with their experiences in readjusting to life and their fears about what they will find at home.
In 1945, when the Red Army releases the inmates of Auschwitz, the Italian chemistry Jew Primo Levi wants to go home in Turin. He embarks in a Russian train and befriends a Greek man. Soon he learns that the trains is heading to the opposite direction and when it stops, Primo and The Greek decide to walk but he is left alone. Along his journey, he spends a period in a Soviet Camp for former prisoners and befriends a group of Italian POW. Only nine months later, he arrives in Turin.
Early in 1945, winter, the Red Army liberates Auschwitz; prisoner 174517, humanist Primo Levi (1919-1987) begins his journey home to Turin. He boards a train that goes the wrong way, further into Poland. After a short time under the guidance of a street-wise, philosophical Greek, Primo is remanded to a displaced persons camp, where freedom is limited, but music and dance rekindle human feeling. The Italians next try to reach Odesa to return home by ship; railroad lines take them only part way, to a Ukrainian camp, where the Greek runs a brothel, and they spend spring and summer. At last, another train takes them through German territory home, where Primo resolves to write.
