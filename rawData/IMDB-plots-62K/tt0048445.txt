Set in the Oklahoma territory in the early 1900s, this musical tells the story of two pairs of lovers.

Ado Annie is torn between Will, a cowboy who has strong feelings for her, and Ali Hakim, a peddler who's a ladies' man and doesn't want to marry her.
Just before Oklahoma became a new state, Laurey Williams notices that Curly, a handsome though shy ranch hand, has been acting strangely around her.

Together, she and Curly have to do something to save their relationship and keep Judd from doing something terrible. Woven into this plot is the life of Ado Annie, one of Laurey's friends. Her boyfriend has just gotten back from an exciting trip to Kansas City. While he was away, she has fallen for a peddler who is a ladies' man and doesn't really want to marry her. Does she give Will, her boyfriend, "all or nuthin'", or does she run away with the peddler?
