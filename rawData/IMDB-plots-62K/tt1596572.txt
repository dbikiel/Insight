In Shinto religion, in order to make something sacred, man will tie a rope around it. This sacred quality of the tying can be applied also to Kinbaku, which is an erotic, spiritual, artistic connection between the people who are doing it
Kinbaku, "tight binding", is a Japanese style of bondage which involves tying up the bottom using simple yet visually intricate patterns, with several pieces of rope usually hemp or jute. It started with samurais capturing enemies on battlefield 500 years ago.
