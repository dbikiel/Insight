An old mirror from the haunted Long Island house finds its way into a photographer's family where the evil soon manifests itself to cause more terror and mayhem.
Photographer Keyes is given an old mirror from an homeless person he photographs on the street, takes it home and gives it a friend. He doesn't know yet that people see horrible things happen to themselves in the mirror and later these things come true. Are these really suicides or is there a demonic force behind the mirror?
After taking the photo of a homeless man, the struggling photographer, Keyes Terry, accepts the thankful vagabond's only possession: his family's mysteriously alluring vintage mirror. However, when Keyes returns home with the unexpected present, the terrible looking-glass starts to spread its demonic force, which stems from the legendary Amityville House, into its new residence, as its unsuspecting victims catch glimpses of violent deaths. Is the ominous polished glass somehow connected to Terry's dark past? Is he the only one who can stop the new generation of evil?
