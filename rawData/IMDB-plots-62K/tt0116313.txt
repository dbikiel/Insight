Reunited by the death of a college friend, three divorced women seek revenge on the husbands who left them for younger women.
After years of helping their hubbies climb the ladder of success, three wives have been dumped for newer, curvier models. But the trio is determined to turn their pain into gain. They come up with a cleverly devious plan to hit their exes where it really hurts, in the wallet. Sit back and watch the sparks fly as The Wives get mad, get even, and get it all. Justice has seldom been so sweet. Or so much fun.
Reunited after nearly three long decades at their friend's funeral, the once-close-knit team of college friends - the Oscar-winning actress, Elise Elliot Atchison (Goldie Hawn); the mouthy Brenda Morelli Cushman (Bette Midler), and the quiet housewife, Annie MacDuggan Paradis (Diane Keaton) - realize that they have much more in common than their ages. Betrayed and divorced by their treasonous husbands for trophy mistresses, the wronged women decide to take matters into their own hands, to avenge themselves, and give them a dose of their own medicine. Now, the exes are hell-bent on getting even. Do their former men stand a chance against the first wives club?
