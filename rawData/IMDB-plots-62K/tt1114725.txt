Two boys travel a thousand miles to deliver three letters as a part of their film school assignment. However, little do they know that the journey they have embarked upon will give a new meaning to their life.
Havaldar Balkar Singh, Captain Dhananjay Shergill and Lieutenant Sahil Naqvi are amongst numerous fatalities on India's side in the 1999 Kargil war against Pakistan. All 3 men had written their last letters to Kuljeet Kaur, Squadron Leader Vikram Singh, and Dr. Naqvi respectively. These letters were located 3 years later by IBN Reporter, Avinash Sarin, who entrusts them to two Indore-based slackers, Ali Shah and Sameer Suri, and asks them to deliver them to Chandigarh, Manali, and Leh respectively. Ali and Sameer set out to film this journey in order to get a graduation degree so that they can re-locate to America as well as televise it widely in order to convince the youth not to join any of India's armed forces.
Because of their lapse in classes at college; two students Sameer Suri and Ali Shah are unable to graduate. The Dean of their college then announces that there is only one way they can now graduate is by submitting a documentary film; after a new moments of pondering they decides that they will make a film that will encourage their country people not to join any of India's armed forces. They then meets IBN reporter Akash Sarin who asks them to locate and post to the families three letters belonging to Havaldar Balkar Singh, Captain Dhananjay Shergill and Lieutenant Sahil Naqvi all of whom are causalities on India's side in the 1999 Kargil war against Pakistan. Sameer and Ali then set off on a motor-bike ride to not only film their movie but to share the grieve, anger and dignity of the families affected by war.
