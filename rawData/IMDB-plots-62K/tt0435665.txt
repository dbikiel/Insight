A virus breaks out at a university and people start to become zombies. After 29 days, a team of AMS scientists and soldiers are sent in to deal with the problem. But while they search, things go wrong.
At Guesta Verde University, the deranged Professor Curien is trying to bring back the dead, killing students for the experiment. There is an outbreak of zombies at the campus, and the government sends an NSA medical research team, formed by Dr. Alexandra Morgan, a.k.a. Nightingale and lieutenant Ellis, with a special force led by lieutenant Dalton, to try to get the zero sample from the first-generation zombie. The team has a very short time to accomplish their mission and leave the place before missiles are sent to destroy the area. However, the place is crowded with hyper sapiens and the group has to fight to survive.
