A Chinese missionary comes to England. He helps a young girl ill-treated by her father. A remake of D. W. Griffith's "Masterpiece".
The spiritual and peace-loving Chen resides in London's Limehouse district, where he teaches and promotes peaceful Buddhist concepts. He is attracted to the beleaguered Lucy Burrows, whose prizefighter father beats her persistently. When Chen rescues Lucy from one of her father's attacks, the boxer sets out to avenge himself on the foreigner.
