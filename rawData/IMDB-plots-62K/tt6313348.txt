Twenty-somethings Hisashi and Mai are engaged. When suddenly Mai's heart stops and she falls into a coma all Hisashi can do is remain by her side, albeit without knowing whether she might improve. Things look up when Mai finally comes out of the coma and becomes conscious again, but she has suffered brain damage and cannot remember her man.
