Thomas has decided to die, and spends his last day driving around to say good-bye to everybody, his son, wife, mistress and all others. Nobody understands that this good-bye is definite, and still he says things they will never forget.
DAY AND NIGHT is about people that love and want to be loved. It's the story of a father, his young son, his unfaithful wife, her secret lover, his young mistress, his lonely sister, his forgetful mother, a fanatic football coach, a pregnant whore and an angel disguised as an old man. They are all looking for the answer to the same question: "If love is the answer - what is the question?"
