Right in front of our very eyes, two attractive and feminine women metamorphose into two professional wrestlers, one heavyweight and one lightweight competitor, who begin a no-holds-barred wrestling match. With a little bit of help from fine dummies, a sprinkle of cinematic magic and some trick photography, the formidable opponents will go to great lengths to win this contest.
This film is a winner, it being one of the most laughable of mysterious picture ever made. An extremely lean man and an extremely fat man are engaged in a wrestling match. The lean man attacks the fat one viciously but cannot budge him from the floor. After wrestling furiously for awhile, the fat man falls upon the lean one and crushes him as flat as a pancake. The fat man then rolls him up in a package about the size of a carpet bag and lays him on the floor, and winds up by tossing him high in the air. The lean man in coming down falls on the fat man's head, knocking him to the floor and causing hiim to explode in a great cloud of smoke, his body being distributed all over the stage. The portions of the fat man's body then begin slowly to come to life, the fat man jumping to his feet and making a hasty exit, seeming glad to get out of the way of his terrible opponent.
