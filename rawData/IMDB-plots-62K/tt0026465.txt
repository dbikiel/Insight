Alarmed that his younger daughter is about to marry a gold-digger, a millionaire turns over the fortune to her ditsy older sister for safe-keeping to his ultimate regret, protection.
Millionaire Harrison Allen is concerned that his daughter Phyllis is dating a gold-digger, so, to test the man's loyalty, he signs away his entire fortune to his other daughter Gracie. Under the impression that her father wants the family to be as poor as possible, Gracie turns the family's mansion into a home for unemployed actors, where she provides them room and board at no charge. Unfortunately, Mr. Allen was correct in his assumptions about Phyllis' boyfriend Ramon, and once the fellow learns that Gracie is the one with all the cash, he sets about trying to woo her into marriage.
A scatterbrained heiress opens her house to a succession of unemployed actors and vaudeville performers, then decides to produce her own show, much to the consternation of her father, her sister and her sister's boyfriend, who is actually after the young girl's money.
Harrison Allen, concerned that a gigolo, Ramon del Ramos, is after his daughter, Phyllis, strictly for her money, deeds over his millions to his ditzy daughter, Gracie. Ere long, Gracie disinherits her father, decides to marry the gigolo herself, and gives him all of the money. Before reaching this point, Mr. Allen has called in his lawyer, George Burns, who grows crazy while watching Gracie convert their penthouse into a home for starving actors, and then tearing down the whole structure and building a magnificent theatre where she produces a show called "Gracie Allen's Flop", and utilizes all her down-and-out vaudevillian friends.
