On his sprawling country estate, an aging writer matches wits with the struggling actor who has stolen his wife's heart.
Two extremely clever British men are in a game of trickery and deceit. Andrew Wyke, an aging famous author who lives alone in a high-tech mansion, after his wife Maggie has left him for a younger man; and Milo Tindle, an aspiring actor, equipped with charm and wit, who demonstrates both qualities once again. When Wyke invites Tindle to his mansion, Tindle seeks to convince the former into letting his wife go by signing the divorce paper. However, Wyke seems far more interested in playing mind games with his wife's new lover, and lures him into a series of actions he thoroughly planned in seeking revenge on his unfaithful spouse.
Andrew Wyke is a famous and successful author of detective novels. Milo Tindle comes to him with a strange request, that Mr. Wyke divorce his wife so that Tindle can marry her. Mr. Wyke is not particularly perturbed by this, he and his wife have drifted apart, and he is having an affair with another woman anyway, but uses the meeting and Mr. Tindle's request as a chance to play a game, a game with potentially deadly consequences.
Milo Tindle, a struggling actor and a chauffeur, doesn't know what to expect when he comes to visit the rich and successful mystery novelist, Andrew Wyke. After all, he is stealing Andrew's wife. His first surprise is learning that the comfortable old English country house is, on the inside, cold and stark and filled with monitors, cameras and other surveillance devices. Its owner, Andrew, lays a thin sheen of civility over his malicious and insulting chatter, and then he gets down to business. That's Milo's second surprise. Andrew claims he wants to be rid of his now-detested wife. But if Andrew agrees to give his wife a divorce and hand her over to Milo, he expects something in return. Andrew has just made the first move in a game of cat and mouse that may prove to be deadly.
