Poland, 1990. The winds of change are blowing in Poland. The first euphoric year of freedom, but also of uncertainty for the future. Four apparently happy women of different ages decide it's time to change their lives, fight for their happiness and fulfill their desires. Agata is a young mother, trapped in an unhappy marriage, who seeks refuge in another, impossible relationship. Renata is an older teacher fascinated with her neighbor Marzena - a lonely former local beauty queen, whose husband works in Germany. Marzena's sister Iza is a headmistress in love with the father of one of her students.
In euphoric early-1990s post-Communist Poland--right after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the dissolution of the Soviet Union--four women experience an utterly different reality, as they sink deeper and deeper into despair. The young married mother, Agata, finds herself consumed by an unhappy marriage and an almost obsessive infatuation for an unreachable man, as the frigid school principal, Iza, battles with rejection. Meanwhile, Iza's sister, Marzena--a 1986 beauty pageant winner, and, nowadays, an aerobic instructor--suffers from her husband's long absence. Likewise, the reclusive middle-aged language teacher, Renata, finds solace in her singing birds, and a silent longing for the unattainable object of her desire: her next-door neighbour. Sadly--as the quartet chases a pure and intense passion in all the wrong places--the piercing sadness of unrequited loves and the unceasing anguish of bitter obsessions linearly connect them. Does pain exist in the United States of Love?
