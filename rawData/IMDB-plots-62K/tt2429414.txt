A German girl travels to Israel to help people with disabilities, where she learns a lot about the role of her grandparents in WWII and meets a man who wants to move to Berlin.
Hanna is a young German that goes to Israel in order to push her career by working with disabled people. Itay, the Israeli social worker, picks on her with Holocaust jokes and cynical comments on German history, whilst obviously flirting with her. She initially reacts with rejection, but after a while Hanna becomes interested in her family's history, and also in Itay.
