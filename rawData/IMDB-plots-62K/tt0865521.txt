Twenty years after she burst into America's collective consciousness, Roseanne Barr is still slinging comedic arrows at society's sacred cows. In her fourth HBO stand-up comedy special, the Emmy(R)-winning actress/comedienne takes aim at everything from old men taking Viagra to Vice President Dick Cheney. Taped before a live audience at the legendary Comedy Store in Los Angeles, the now-blonde Barr shows she's lost none of her candid, self-effacing, outspoken verve as she probes such topics as growing up Jewish in Salt Lake City, working 'in a cement box' on her TV series 'Roseanne,' and her disdain for the diet industry, the President, religious fanatics and more.
