William Hoyland stars in this legendary, multi award-winning short film directed by the modernist writer and film-maker BS Johnson. You're Human Like the Rest of Them is an adaptation of Johnson's decasyllabic poem about mortality. A teacher recites the poems lines first in a hospital surrounded by aging pensioners and then at work in a classroom, and finally in the school staff room. This title is also available on the DVD/Blu-ray 'You're Human Like the Rest of Them: The films of BS Johnson' in the BFI Flipside collection.
