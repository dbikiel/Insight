Every dorm has a tale. But this tale, you will never forget.
In Thailand, the young Ton Chatree is sent to a boarding school by his father to study harder and have less entertainment with television. Once in the school, Ton feels outcast and misses his family and friends. He becomes scared with the ghost stories his new schoolmates tell about a boy that died in the swimming pool and a young pregnant woman that committed suicide. He becomes a close friend of the also lonely boy Vichien, and later Ton realizes that Vichien is the boy that drowned in the swimming pool, and his death repeats every night. Ton tries to find a way to help his friend to rest in piece.
Ton is sent, against his will, to a boarding school outside of Bangkok. There, he learns about a boy who drowned in the now emptied swimming pool. His spirit, it is believed, still haunts the school. His mysterious death puzzles the new student and Ton decides to set out to uncover the entire story behind this event.
