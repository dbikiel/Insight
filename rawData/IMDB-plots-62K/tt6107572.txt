Exhausted after leaving work, Alfonso goes to the beach and dives into the sea. Coming to the surface, he finds himself on another beach, in another time. His parents are waiting for him, calling to him from the water's edge. Alfonso sees and understands everything from his adult's body, even if they treat him like an 11 year old. This is the beginning of a fantastic voyage through the different holidays in his life, where the situations come one after the other with no chronological order, interrupting with a tone of intimacy and entertaining nostalgia his meetings with girlfriends, teenage and childhood pals, his daughter, and his loneliness.
