A doctor's obsession with a teenage patient turns violent and dangerous.
A teenage girl named Sophie is rushed to the hospital after a terrible car accident. Lucky for Sophie, heart surgeon Dr. Albert Beck is at the hospital to save her life. While Sophie recovers nicely in the hospital, Dr. Beck tends to her, more than Sophie's mother would like. A mother's instinct is never wrong.
