A quirky take on life and relationships as it looks at a fairy tale with a bit of a squint and an endearing look at what being in love really means.
Falling in love. It's very easy to do. Being in love - now that's the tough part. Nick (Saif Ali Khan) - He's a chef. Ambar (Preity Zinta) - She's a Radio Jockey. They're young, they're cool, they're independent -and together they make the PERFECT pair. Or do they? Surrounded by quirky friends, bosses and landlords but far away from home. Nick and Ambar take a huge leap of faith as they decide to move in together. And now they must tiptoe towards getting to know each other? They are attracted to each other - but they fight. They live together, but as friends, in different rooms. They're in a relationship - but then again they're not. They seem to want the same things, but it seems that they have very little in common. Between all this chaos, they find out that Ambar is pregnant. Nick doesn't want the baby. How the two handle this dilemma is what will decide the direction this relationship will take and be the real test of their love. So are they really made for each other? Are they actually compatible? Is this whole thing worth it? After all, if a relationship is what happens when you're busy not thinking about it - then what does it mean when everything has to be such a "decision"? SALAAM NAMASTE gives us a quirky take on life, love and relationship as it looks at a fairy tale with a bit of a squint. Full of colour, humour and zest it is an endearing look at what being in love really means!!.
