Four modern stories of remarkable courage while setting out to uncover the forgotten life of Raphael Lemkin, the man who coined the term 'genocide'. Inspired by Samantha Power's Pulitzer Prize-winning book, 'A Problem From Hell', 'Watchers of the Sky' traverses time and continents to explore genocide and the cycle of violence.
From the Armenian genocide to the Syrian civil war, THIS I BELIEVE examines the cycle of violence, and the world's response, from a variety of angles: historical, psychological, political, legal, and experiential. Interwoven with modern stories this feature-length documentary film reveals the forgotten life of Raphael Lemkin, the dogged inventor of the word 'genocide.' THIS I BELIEVE takes you on a journey from Nuremberg to Rwanda, from Bosnia to Darfur, and from apathy to action.
