An old, lonesome bear tells the story of his life through a mechanical diorama.
Every day, a melancholy old bear takes a mechanical diorama that he has created out to his street corner. For a coin, passersby can look into the peephole of his invention, which tells the story of a circus bear who longs to escape and return to the family from which he was taken.
In his dusty workshop, a solitary and sorrowful elderly bear puts the final touches to his life's magnum opus: a spectacular mechanical diorama recounting an exciting and beautiful story. Meticulously, the old artisan fiddles with his machine in solitude, however, a family photo of his wife and his son proves that he wasn't always alone. Where is his family?
