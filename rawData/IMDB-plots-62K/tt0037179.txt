An elderly couple move into an old, supposedly haunted abandoned house. A young girl comes to live with the pair as a companion for the wife. However, soon the girl is possessed by the spirit of another girl, a wealthy woman who had once lived in the house but who had been murdered there.
By 1900, Bellingham House located in Newburgh has been sitting empty for forty years following the death of its last resident, Miss Elizabeth Harkness. By some accounts, she was murdered. Retired couple Henry and Emilie Smedhurst buy the house, knowing only about the house that Miss Harkness died, and that local lore deems that it is haunted. Henry believes no such nonsense, although Emilie does believe that houses retain a little of each of its previous residents. They hire young Annette Allenby to be Emilie's companion, Annette who is drawn to something about the house. She is also drawn to Dr. Robert Selbie, as he is to her as the two soon become engaged. Over time, mysterious things do happen at the house, and on occasion Annette feels as though something or someone is possessing her. As neither Robert or Henry believe in ghosts, they have to come up with a plausible explanation for what is happening to Annette, especially why she keeps speaking of a Dr. Marsham, who happened to be Miss Harkness' physician. But Emilie is certain that Miss Harkness has some destiny to fulfill before the house and Annette can be in peace.
