The Roth family leads a quiet life in a small village in the German Alps during the early 1930s. When the Nazis come to power, the family is divided and Martin Brietner, a family friend is caught up in the turmoil.
Interesting to note that the film was made in 1940, one year before America's entry into the European war against Hitler. The movie depicts Germany in 1933. In 1938 the 'night of broken glass' took place. Interesting to note the attitudes portrayed in the film, definitely anti-Nazi.
On January 30, 1933 in a small village in southern Germany, Professor Roth celebrates his 60th birthday. It's also the day that Adolf Hitler becomes Chancellor of Germany. The professor is admired by his colleagues and students and much loved by his wife, stepsons Otto and Erich, and his daughter Freya. Otto, Erich and Freya's fianc√© Fritz Marburg are all become avid Nazis and Professor Roth, who is a "non-Aryan" is soon sent to a concentration camp. Freya ends her engagement to Fritz and she and her lifelong friend Martin Breitner soon fall in love. The oppressive regime forces Martin to flee to Austria and after the professor dies Freya and her mother try to flee but Freya is detained. Martin come to her rescue but they must escape a Nazi patrol that is tracking them down.
University professor Victor Roth leads a contented life with family and friends in the south German Alps of 1933. This changes quickly and dramatically once Adolf Hitler comes to power. Most of the town embraces the new creed while a few friends such as Martin Breitner do not. Victor himself is "non-Aryan" and his two step-sons soon leave his house, while his loyal daughter Freya breaks her engagement from Nazi-inclined Fritz. Against increasing difficulties an attachment between Freya and Martin starts to grow.
