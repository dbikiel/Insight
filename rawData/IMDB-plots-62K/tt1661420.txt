A journalist covering police assigned to a juvenile division enters an affair with one of her subjects.
The daily grind for the cops of the Police Department's Juvenile Protection Unit - taking in child molesters, busting underage pickpockets and chewing over relationship issues at lunch; interrogating abusive parents, taking statements from children, confronting the excesses of teen sexuality, enjoying solidarity with colleagues and laughing uncontrollably at the most unthinkable moments. Knowing the worst exists and living with it. How do these cops balance their private lives and the reality they confront every working day? Fred, the group's hypersensitive wild card, is going to have a hard time facing the scrutiny of Melissa, a photographer on a Ministry of the Interior assignment to document the unit.
In Paris, the photographer Melissa is assigned by the Ministry of the Interior to document the daily activities of the BPM - the Police Division for Child Protection under the command of Chief Baloo. Along the days, Melissa witnesses and takes photos of pedophiles, children and women abusers and befriends the team of detectives, sharing their working days and leaning how their jobs affect their private lives. Soon she has a love affair with the sensitive and emotive Detective Fred.
