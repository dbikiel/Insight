Based on actual court transcripts of 8 anti-war protesters on trial for conspiring to cause riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.
The Chicago 8 is the true story of the notorious 1968 trial that resulted when seven leaders of an anti-war movement, and a member of the Black Panthers (Bobby Seale), were charged with conspiracy to incite devastating riots in Chicago. Desperate to stop what they saw as an ?immoral war?, this group was ready to take on the establishment, express their freedom of speech by all means necessary, while paying a price for their actions. Never in America?s history has youthful protest captured society?s imagination nor polarized it to such a degree. A protest paralleled in the modern era, with recent establishment uprisings on Wall Street and in the Middle East.
