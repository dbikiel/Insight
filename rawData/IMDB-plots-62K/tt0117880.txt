Three freedom fighters attack a large corporation to prevent a future apocalypse.
In the year 2029, a computer called Skynet is fighting against a human resistance, after having nearly destroyed the rest of humanity in 1997. Skynet has found a way to send some of it's warriors, called Terminators, back in time. This is the story of the Terminator sent to kill the resistance leader in 1996. The resistance sends a reprogrammed Terminator back to 1996 to protect the young man, and the two end up traveling to the year 2029. The question is, can the future resistance leader and the Terminator defeat another new Terminator while destroying Skynet in the future?
Presented as an attraction at the Universal Theme Park (Summer 1996), T2:3-D invites the audience to a presentation of future technology by the Cyberdyne Corporation; creators of the present T-800 Terminators and future creator of Skynet. Unfortunately, half-way through the presentation, they are sabotaged (live) by Sarah and John Connor, who inform us of the future doom Cyberdyne will unknowingly bring to the world. The audience is soon joined by the T-1000 as well as Arnold's T-800 on stage via motorcycle. The T-101 grabs John and exits the stage via a 3-D time portal and quickly pursued by the T-1000. From there it is all 3-D movie magic in which the T-8000 and John Connor must defeat Skynet which is guarded by the powerful T-1M (T-One Million).
