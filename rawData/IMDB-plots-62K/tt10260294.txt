Young Katya meets a merry company of visiting guys who have a specific entertainment - to organize parties in other people's empty houses. And Katya knows the right place: an old summer cottage on the coast, the owner of which left for a long time. The secluded house, in which the spiritualist salon was at the beginning of the last century, seems to everyone an excellent option. The alarming, even terrible abandonment of this place does not frighten anyone - In the midst of the party, someone whom Katya never expected to see appears: the mysterious master of the house - The man she loved. A man in the grip of otherworldly forces.
