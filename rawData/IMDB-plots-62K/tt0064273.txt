Gary Hamilton, innocently sentenced to ten years in prison is released. When he comes out he promises himself to seek revenge on the guilty.
After 10 years in prison, a man who was betrayed by his ex-lover and framed-up by his ex-partner seeks vengeance despite the fact that his former partner, now rich and influential, employs a small army of henchmen. Former Confederate officer Gary Hamilton has served 10 years in a hard-labor prison for a robbery that took place in the final days of the Civil War. A transport of Confederate gold was robbed by Acombar who then left Gary Hamilton's water-flask at the scene, in an effort to incriminate him. However, Gary Hamilton had an alibi as he was at his girlfriend's house that day. Nevertheless, during the trial, his girlfriend, Maria, corrupted by Acombar's promises of money, lied and said that she was alone that day. Gary Hamilton ended up in prison for 10 years while Acombar ended up with the loot and the girl. Maria married Acombar. Released from prison, Gary Hamilton returns to the town where Acombar and Maria now live. He plans to exact revenge but Acombar is surrounded by an army of bodyguards. Informed about Hamilton's return into town, Acombar instructs his men to wait in ambush and kill Hamilton. The odds are against Hamilton but at least he can take advantage of the secret network of underground tunnels running under the town. The tunnels are part of an ancient Indian burial site. The final showdown comes at dusk, during a terrible wind storm.
