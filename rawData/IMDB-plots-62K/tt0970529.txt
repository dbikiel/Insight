Young Randy has dreamed of being a stuntman, teaming up with misfit stunt-team the Timaru Hellriders, is employed by mentor-turned Dick Johansonson, and meets the one-legged cunning stunt babe Tracy "Tragedy" Jones.
"The Devil Dared Me To" follows the story of daredevil stuntman Randy Cambell and his quest to follow in his late father's footsteps and become New Zealand's greatest daredevil stuntman. Ever since growing up as a young boy on a remote New Zealand sheep-farm, Randy has dreamed of performing the ultimate daredevil stunt: jumping across Cook Strait in a rocket car. It is this dream that sends him on his quest from the South Island sheep farm to the bright lights of Auckland city. Along the way Randy teams up with the traveling misfit stunt-team the Timaru Hellriders, is employed by mentor-turned nemesis stunt co-ordinator Dick Johansonson, and meets the love of his life, the one-legged cunning stunt babe Tracy "Tragedy" Jones.
