These days, women want it all: good job, hot romance, and incredible sex. Directed by Lee Eon Hee (...ing), trendy and provocative new film Love Exposure explores the very roots of female psychology and women's definition of love and marriage in the 21st century. Lee Mi Yeon (Indian Summer, Typhoon) strips away her usual whispery image and takes on a bold sexy role in what is considered to be a trademark chick-lit film, targeting female viewers in their 20s and 30s. Also starring Lee Tae Ran (Famous Chil Princess) in her silver screen debut, Love Exposure underwent four cycles of censorship review for its sexual content. Taking hold of the baton from predecessors like Singles (2003) and Rules of Dating (2005), Love Exposure peeks into the minds of today's modern women, offering plenty of tongue-in-cheek humor, raunchy dialogue, and eye-opening scenes. Jung Wan (Lee Mi Yeon) is a 32-year-old fledging photographer who has no desire to get married. When it comes to romance, she holds no illusions nor fairytale fantasies. But lately, she notices that her skin is beginning to look rather dry and dull, and her body stricken with minor aches here and there. She concludes that what she needs is a man, or rather sex to revitalize her aging body. Then there is Hee Soo (Lee Tae Ran), her childhood friend who shocked everyone when she married a homely, pot-bellied man. An attractive housewife with plenty of dating experience under her belt, Hee Soo sees her husband as a security blanket and a lifetime ticket to free spending and no worries. But all hell breaks loose when Jung Won finally meets her Prince Charming and Hee Soo realizes her only insurance in life is about to expire. Love and marriage were never meant to be this complicated - or are they?
