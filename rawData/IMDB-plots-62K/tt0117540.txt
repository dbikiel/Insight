Two teenagers from Helsinki are sent on a mission by their drug dealer.
Ippe and Papu are two hip-hop teenagers from Helsinki with a serious problem: They have made a contract with an older drug-dealer Kalle to provide customers. The boys fail to do this and end up in debt to Kalle. There seems to be only one solution, to smuggle drugs from Sweden across the border in order to pay the debt.
