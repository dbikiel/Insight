Over a period of a week the voice of God is heard on radios all over the world.
"Joe Smith, American" lives in a Los Angeles suburb and works at an aircraft plant. One night Joe hears a voice cut in on a radio program: "This is God. I'll be with you for the next few days." It turns out, everyone in the world listening to any radio heard the same thing. More messages come; some people react positively, others negatively.
Joe Smith is a everyday American who works in aircraft factory in the years after World War II. He owns a house and is happily married to Mary who is expecting their second child any day now. Son Johnny is a good boy who has is own paper route and does well in school, even if does struggle with his arithmetic. Sitting down at 8:30 one evening to listen to his favorite radio program something strange happens: the program is interrupted by a solitary voice who claims to be God and mentions that he will be with them for the next few days. Many people around the world heard the same broadcast, all in their own language at exactly the same moment. The voice returns for the next several days with some believing it to be a hoax and while others are inspired.
