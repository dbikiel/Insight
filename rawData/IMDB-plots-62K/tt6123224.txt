A mysterious traveler journeys across space and time in search of the origin of the universe, life, and God. Eventually finding himself alone in the dying light of an aging cosmos, he arrives at a devastating realization. Yet the world continues to spin. Through sharp modernist shapes and a riveting score by composer duo Menalon, I Am Here takes a curious and contemplative approach to dark and complex themes like the nature of time and consciousness. Directed by OscarÂ®-shortlisted animator Eoin Duffy and featuring the voice acting of Nicholas Campbell (Da Vinci's Inquest, Goon), I Am Here is a thoughtful and open-ended exploration of existence itself.
