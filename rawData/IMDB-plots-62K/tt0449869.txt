Creepy happenings in an abandoned mansion are attributed to the ghost of an ancient courtesan, back for revenge
Senthil and Ganga marry against the wishes of their extended family, and move into a mansion right next to where the cousin intended as Senthil's bride Shweta lives. Several members of Shweta's family are miffed at Senthil's "unauthorized" wedding, and his mother start's fearing for the newlyweds' safety when they move next-doors to their cousins. Soon after moving into their new house, strange things start happening, whether these are caused by the apparent ghost of a former occupant, Chandramukhi, or any one of the suspicious members of the extended family, will be looked into by "psychiatrist extraordinaire" Dr. Sarvanan.
Shweta believes she is Senthilnathan's childhood sweetheart and everyone expects them to get married when they mature. But Senthilnathan falls in love with Ganga and marries her, and thereafter re-locates to move into a palatial house right next door to Shweta. Shortly thereafter a number of incidents occur, leading them to suspect Shweta. Senthilnathan invites his foster brother and Psychiatric Dr. Sarvanan to assist them and possibly treat Shweta - not realizing that the entity behind these incidents is a vengeful spirit that will soon engulf and endanger everyone's lives.
