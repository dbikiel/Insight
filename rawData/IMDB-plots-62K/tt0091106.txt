He risked it all to make the grade.
The true story of a teacher in Los Angeles who becomes the Principal of George Washington Memorial High School. The school and its students are affected by the normal life of gangs and drugs in their lives. McKenna wanted to give the students a real choice at education and all it offered for their future. But he faced teachers used to the reality of their school, parents unable or unwilling to give the kids the support they needed, and kids just wanting to survive the streets never mind learning something. After Denzel Washington (George McKenna) became a superstar, the film was re-released on home video under the title Hard Lessons.
