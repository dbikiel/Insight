At an international school in Jakarta, a philosophy teacher challenges his class of twenty graduating seniors to choose which ten of them would take shelter underground and reboot the human race in the event of a nuclear apocalypse.
When the last day of school comes for a group of students in a philosophy class, their instructor, Mr. Zimit, challenges them to different sorts of exercises that take place in a post-nuclear apocalyptic world. While there, they each get chosen professions and have to decide whether who is valuable or not because the bunker they will be staying in for a year has only enough oxygen for 10 people. Mr. Zimit challenges them in different rounds to see how they could survive. Issues arise when they notice Mr. Zimit is disruptive to the game.
Mr. Zimit, a philosophy teacher challenges his 20 students on the last class with situations in which they have to choose 10 students from the class in order to survive in a shelter for a year during a apocalypse.But, Mr. Zimit brings a little twist to the games.
In an international school in Jakarta, a philosophy class is having its last session. The professor challenges twenty-one graduating seniors to select ten who would take shelter underground for one year and then emerge to rebuild the human race following a nuclear attack. The students are each provided varying attributes, skills and professions that may or may not be deemed as valuable in reforming society one year following the attack. While the professor and individual students may have differing opinions regarding which skills and talents may be of the most value during the year underground and in rebuilding society after that year, one pivotal and timeless question is addressed. Which is more valuable to individuals, and thus society as a whole, Art or Science?
