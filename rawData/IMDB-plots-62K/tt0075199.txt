The Westernized grandson of a shaman returns to the wilderness to learn more about his Native American heritage. When he encounters powerful evil spirits, he enlists the aid of his lover and a local chief to stop the spirits.
The aging Indian medicine man Old Man Hawk (Chief Dan George) arrives in the city to request help of his grandson Mike (Jan-Michael Vincent), a successful business executive. Old Man Hawk is fighting a sorcerous war with the witch Dsonqua (Marianne Jones) who was executed two hundred years before and is now seeking revenge. Mike, who has no interest in the Indian ways, is reluctantly drawn in to helping. Joined by a woman journalist named Maureen (Marilyn Hassett), Mike agrees to drive his grandfather three hundred miles home. But along the way Dsonqua increases her efforts and summons magical forces to destroy them.
