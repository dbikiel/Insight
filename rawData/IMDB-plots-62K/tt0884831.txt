An experimental fantasy short dedicated to questioning whether or not man is a prisoner of time.
Finished shooting in 1962, the movie's cast was almost the same as its crew. With a bunch of experimental symbols such as skinny human body, clock and goat flow from one scene to another, the film explores the question of whether a man is a prisoner of time.
