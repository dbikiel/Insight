After a global cataclysm, mankind has degraded to a tribal society. In one of the tribes there is a disagreement about what is the best way to survive.
A group of post-apocalyptic survivors struggle to survive in a world where jungles, forests, primeval wetlands and deserts have obliterated civilization. They staunchly face genetically mutated beasts and mysterious diseases in an attempt to re-establish the human race as masters of Earth.
In a post-apocalyptic world, a group of survivors led by Uri and the ancients are organized into a tribe in a primitive society without technology, living in a small village in the Grey Rock National Park surrounded by beasts that transmit a disease that transforms the victims into mutants. Uri's son, Savan, is the best hunter of their tribe and successor of his father, while Kaleb is the best tracker, and together with his sister, Miru, (Eleanor Tomlinson) they are the only survivors that can read and write. Their father, Jaret, believes that other survivors might exist outside Grey Rock and leaves them alone to wander around the area. Kaled is a dreamer and secretly loves Savan's woman, Dorel. When the beasts attack Uri's hamlet, a group of people run to a cave and block the entrance with logs. Kaleb saves Dorel from a beast and soon Savan meets them. Out of the blue, the stranger, Amal, approaches the trio and invites them to join his family, composed of his wife, Neenah, and their son, Persk. They live in the outskirts of Grey Rock, protected by a river. Soon, Amal discloses to them that Jaret has found the formula of a yellow powder that can cure the sick people. However, the evil Gagen has stolen the powder and keeps it with him. Amal, Savan, Kaleb and Dorel travel together to find Gagen and bring the yellow powder to their tribe.
