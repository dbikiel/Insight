Set against the turbulent atmosphere of the 1960s, Tropicália is a feature length documentary exploring the Brazilian artistic movement known as tropicália, and the struggle its artists endured to protect their right to freely express revolutionary thought against the traditional brazilian music of that time.
This carefully researched film investigates the cultural movement which began in Brazil in the late 1960s as a reaction to the popular music and nationalism of the period. Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Tom Zé and others mull over their experience, while magnificent archive footage brings to life the sheer inventiveness and political reach of "Tropicalism".
