Two teenage outcasts run away from a halfway house and embark on a rambling cross-country journey.
A  boy and a girl meet at a custody center for problem youth. The boy has come to serve his obligatory civil service. The girl is one of the youths in custody, and she is constantly in trouble, a fire inside her, a lust for life that can't be quashed, or controlled. The boy becomes infatuated with the girl. He is a quiet one; a stutterer. But there is a fire inside him as well.
 
Rules, laws, punishment; the shackles of the hostile environment with no understanding around them can be broken. They steal a car and flee together.  Thus begins a journey with endless escapes.
