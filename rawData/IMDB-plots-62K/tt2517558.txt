When three generations of one family temporarily have to live together under one roof chaos ensues.
Conrad doesn't often go and see his parents. Every time he and his wife are visiting them, they are subjected to endless criticism from his father Carl. But during this year's obligatory birthday visit at home, Conrad's mother has a surprise for them: She is going to leave Carl after their marriage of 40 years. And she asks Conrad to keep an eye on his father and make sure he is all right. Carl, alone now in the big house, drowns his sorrows in alcohol, and one day he injures himself so badly in a domestic accident that Conrad and his young son have to move in with him for a while and care for him. But life is not easy when three generations of men have to live together under one roof.
