Something is eating the residents of Exceptional Vista!
An isolated Canadian town (populated by the weirdest group of people this side of Saturn) has seen its share of problems.

Can visiting atomic scientist (and expert on "cool fusion") Dr. Karel Lamonte solve the mystery before everyone disappears?
