A Norwegian farmer lovingly raises his daughter in rural World War II-era Benson Junction, Wisconsin.
Life in small town Wisconsin. Selma and Arnold, aged 7 and 5, pal around together between their two farms. Selma has a newborn calf that her father gave to her which she named 'Elizabeth'. Nels is the editor of the Fuller Junction Spectator and the kids just call him 'editor'. Viola is the new school teacher from the big city. While Nels wants to marry Viola, Viola does not want to live in a small quiet, nothing happening town. The biggest news is that Faraassen has built a new barn.
The small town of Fuller Junction is located in Wisconsin farming country, largely populated by Norwegian immigrants and their descendants. It is because of her Norwegian heritage that Milwaukee city slicker Miss Viola Johnson reluctantly agrees to do her one year mandatory teaching practicum there. She feels it will be a long one year, despite the friendship of Nels Halverson, better know to locals as Editor, the second generation owner and editor of the local newspaper, the Spectator. One of Miss Johnson's students is seven year old Selma Jacobson, the only offspring of Martinius and Bruna Jacobson, with whom she has a loving relationship. Selma spends much of her time with her five year old cousin, Arnold Hanson, who is her best friend... most of the time. Despite her tender age and the loving relationship she not only has with her parents but the community as a whole, Selma is not immune to experiencing individual and sharing collective heartache. But she is also one who can affect real change in the community.
