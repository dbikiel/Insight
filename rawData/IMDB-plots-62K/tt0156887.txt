A retired pop singer turned actress' sense of reality is shaken when she is stalked by an obsessed fan and seemingly a ghost of her past.
Mima leaves the idol group CHAM, in order to pursue her dream as an actress. Mima climbs up the rocky road to success by performing as rape victims and posing nude for magazines, but is haunted by her reflections of the past.
Encouraged by her manager, Rumi, the lead singer of the successful J-Pop group, "CHAM!", and teen idol, Mima Kirigoe, decides to quit her bubblegum trio to pursue an acting career in the television soap, "Double Bind". However, her bold choice doesn't sit well with the young band's male admirers, especially the unknown die-hard fan who starts posting insidious threats and disturbingly intimate information about Mima's life on her blog--entries Mima swears aren't hers. Now, all those who talked Mima into embracing her "bad girl" persona end up brutally murdered, and a menacing doppelg√§nger harasses her. Is this strange and dangerous situation merely a palpable delusion, or is Mima, indeed, being stalked by a violent killer?
