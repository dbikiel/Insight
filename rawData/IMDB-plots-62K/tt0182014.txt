Unknowingly, a copy shop employee sets off a bizarre series of events with utterly unforeseen consequences.
In a typical morning just like any other, Alfred Kager wakes up, puts on his clothes and prepares to go to work at the copy shop. There, while making one copy after another, he unknowingly photocopies the palm of his hand, and as if by magic, the mysterious machine starts generating duplicates of himself and his surroundings, as well as random scenes of previous events. The machine is unstoppable and the consequences of this chain reaction, utterly unforeseen. Can Alfred put an end to this nightmare before the world is consumed by "Alfred"?
Wordless story about a man who awakes in his bed wearing his clothes (including a check vest). He rises, washes his face, combs his hair, and heads for work across the street at a copy shop. He inadvertently makes a photocopy of his hand, and then the machine beings turning out copies of photographs of himself, the street outside, and his apartment. He unplugs the copier and heads home. He repeats the scene we saw earlier. Copies of himself emerge from bed; baffled, he watches them go to work. Soon, it seems, he's part of a society in which everyone looks like him and wears check vest. Can he get things back to normal?
