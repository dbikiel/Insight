A group of slackers face an army of zombies. The Cuban government and media claim the living dead are dissidents revolting against the government.
Juan is a slacker trying to reconnect with his daughter, who plans to rejoin her mother in Miami. Lazaro, Juan's friend, is trying to connect with his own son, a persistent womanizer. They begin to notice that locals are "going crazy", killing people and eating their flesh, and the recently deceased are returning to life. The Cuban government and the media claim that the zombies are dissidents revolting against the government. Juan starts a business to profit off of killing the zombies, but the group may soon find their own lives at risk.
