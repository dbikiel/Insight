Frank is especially interested in finishing with Sol "Solly" Casper (Ted de Corsia), a gangster who pesters Bay City citizens, demanding ransom in exchange of protection. Obviously, Solly is looking for a way to end with Jansen's prestige, and there may be something in trying to spy on his secretary / girlfriend to finish with his credibility. Ben doesn't want to help Solly with that, because he is in love with June, and he doesn't want Solly to disturb her reputation while trying to finish with Frank. Solly laughs about Ben's scruples, stating that he'll die old but poor, and that he is kind of in-between: he's not all honesty, but he's not a "business man" either.
