In late summer of 2011, five young friends on a road trip went missing after being attacked by nomadic cannibals in a huge RV. Video was recorded by the victims &amp; recovered by police as evidence in their still-unsolved murders.
This is a 'found-footage' movie from Canada about five young friends who go on a trip to a cabin back in 2011, but on the way (while filming it) they head off the beaten track to a place called Crowsnest where they have heard that you can buy beer for half price! They get the beer but at the same time they receive a warning to head back where they came from or they will die. But they don't take the warning too seriously and keep driving in to the forest. But they seem to be lost, then an RV hits one of them and all hell breaks loose. There's something about the people in the RV. Will the friends survive?
