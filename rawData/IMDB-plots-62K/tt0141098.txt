A soon-to-be-married man encounters an exciting stranger after his plane suffers an accident on takeoff.
Ben Holmes, a professional book-jacket blurbologist, is trying to get to Savannah for his wedding. He just barely catches the last plane, but a seagull flies into the engine as the plane is taking off. All later flights are cancelled because of an approaching hurricane, so he is forced to hitch a ride in a Geo Metro with an attractive but eccentric woman named Sarah.
Ben Holmes, a pretty regular guy, is on his way to his wedding. A little accident hinders the takeoff, and soon Ben finds himself in a third person's rental car together with eccentric but attractive Sarah. Several catastrophic incidents later, the two are thought to be a married couple and run into Ben's best friend and his girlfriend, who happens to be the bride's best friend. Now, Ben and Sarah have to face the problem that they really might be made for each other, but they also might just be panicking about the upcoming events: His marriage and her first meeting with a special person.
