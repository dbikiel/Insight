'Getting Back To Abnormal' is an intimate look at race, politics and culture in post-Katrina New Orleans. Five years after the storm, New Orleans has changed. It is less black and less poor, and one polarizing white politician has become a lightning rod for all things racial. Councilperson Stacy Head, a self-styled corruption fighter, takes her sometimes jaw-droppingly politically incorrect style into the tribal world of New Orleans politics as she fights to maintain her seat in a black majority district. Weaved into the narrative are stories about housing, and commentary from only-in-New Orleans armchair philosophers.
