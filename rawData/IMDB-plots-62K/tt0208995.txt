18-year-old schoolgirl Y chooses her first lover (rather than wait to be raped, as were her two older sisters). After phone sex with 38-year-old J, a sculptor they begin an affair that, by the second meeting, includes spankings as foreplay. He brings a suitcase full of rods, hoses, and wires; she gathers sticks to bring. Her brother discovers the affair. His wife, studying in Paris, calls him to join her. Will the lovers part? Will the violence get out of hand? When do the lies begin?
