Cruel, and utterly effective, Peter Foldes' experimentation with computer animation employs a bold speechless narrative to draw attention to the grave effects of consumerism. Who needs ethics when everything is within arm's reach?
Animated film satire of self-indulgence in a hungry world. Rapidly dissolving, reshaping images, made with the aid of a computer, create a stark contrast between abundance and want. A man eats, at first sparingly, but his appetite grows to gluttony, greed, and gratification of every desire. The nightmare that finally haunts him is the one that hangs over our disparate world. A film without words.
Rough, crude, cruel, and utterly effective, Peter Foldes' pioneering experimentation with computer animation, employs a bold speechless narrative to draw attention to the grave effects of consumerism. Pivoting around the powerful doctrine of consumers' sovereignty, a rapacious businessman's voracious appetite leads, inevitably, to a violent and nauseating transformation. Devoured by greed, the man keeps eating more, and more, and more, until the startling climactic finale. In the end, who needs ethics when everything is within arm's reach?
A man indulges in eating until it kills him.
