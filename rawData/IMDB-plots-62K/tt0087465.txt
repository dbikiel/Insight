A portrait of the life, culture and food surrounding the lovers of Polka music. The title is taken from an old Polka standard. Stars of the Polka world are highlighted.
The polka culture in the United States is presented. Largely associated as being Polish in nature, the strong polka culture today is primarily an American phenomenon, it having largely died off in Central Europe except in rural areas. Polka festivals have sprung up across the country, getting longer and longer each successive year based on demand. Beyond its Central European origins, the polka in the United States has morphed, adding other elements, such as other dances including the swing, and religion. Devotees explain the reason they love the culture so much, some likening it to a less dangerous form of a drug. And with a large proportion of those participating in polka and polka events being of the younger generations, the polka "fad" does not seem like it will soon die.
