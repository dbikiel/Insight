In Puglia, a cooperative wants to farm the land confiscated from a Mafioso, as it is legally entitled to do. But things are moving slowly. So the members of the cooperative turn to Filippo, who belongs to an anti-mafia organisation with its headquarters in the north. Filippo arrives in Puglia and realises that everyone, starting with the carabinieri, is taking huge liberties with the law.
