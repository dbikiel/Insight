Three friends drive from Holland to Morocco to deliver a taxi to a family friend, but the trip turns out more complicated than expected.
It's summer, and recent college graduate Nadir has accepted to drive his father's old taxi from their home in the Netherlands to his family's home country of Morocco to deliver it to a friend. Without notice his two friends Abdel and Zakaria join him on the trip. Nadir doesn't want to waste time, but his friends insist on picking up a French hitchhiker and letting her show them around Barcelona. We eventually learn that there is more to the trip for Nadir than just delivering a car, and it becomes a conflict that threatens the three men's friendship.
RABAT takes you on a road trip with three friends, Nadir (Nasrdin DCHAR), Abdel (Achmed AKKABI) and Zakaria (Marwan KENZARI). When Nadirs father suddenly sends him off to drive an old taxi from Amsterdam to Rabat, his two best friends invite themselves along. The trip takes them through the European landscape of France and Spain to the Moroccan capital itself. Brushes with new cultures and people they encounter along the way and the real reason for his trip that Nadir tries to conceal from the others, put their friendship increasingly under pressure as the trio approach Rabat.
