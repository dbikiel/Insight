A landlady suspects her new lodger is Jack the Ripper.
In late Victorian London, Jack the Ripper has been killing and maiming actresses in the night. The Burtons are forced to take in a lodger due to financial hardship. He seems like a nice young man, but Mrs. Burton suspects him of being the ripper because of some mysterious and suspicious habits, and fears for her beautiful actress niece who lives with them.
Mrs. Bonting manages to keep up appearances, but little more than that, these days. Though Mr. Bonting is unhappy over the idea of letting rooms, it seems an answer to a prayer when a peculiar young man named Mr. Slade rents both a room and the attic. He even pays twenty pounds in advance. But he is peculiar. He claims to be conducting scientific experiments, which is supposed to explain why he is out at all hours and why he can be found in the attic burning things. His antipathy toward actresses is particularly strange. The walls of his room have paintings of actresses, and the first thing he does is turn them all to the wall. Mrs. Bonting's niece happens to live in the house, too. And she's a music-hall actress. None of this would seem particularly alarming. But Jack the Ripper is on the loose. And all his victims are connected in some way to the stage. And no one knows who he is.
