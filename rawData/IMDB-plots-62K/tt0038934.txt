A young heiress finds evidence suggesting that at night she acts under the influence of a family curse and has begun committing ghastly murders in a nearby park.
Several murders have been committed in a London park and the victims have been savagely clawed about the throat. The police believe that a woman is a killer, and perhaps she is a (she) werewolf. Heiress Phyllis Allenby, fears she is the criminal, based on the family legend of the "Allenby Curse" which was the belief that members of the family at times assumed the form of a wolf. Her aunt's constant reminders to her of the "Allenby Curse" only serves to keep her niece's fears alive.
In the turn of the century in London, the aristocratic lawyer Barry Lanfield proposes to marry the heiress Phyllis Allenby and she accepts. Phyllis lives in the family manor with her "aunt" Martha Winthrop, her pseudo-niece Carol Winthrop and the housemaid Hannah. Out of the blue, dreadful murders happen in a nearby park and Detective Latham believes that they are victims of a werewolf or a she-wolf, but his superior Inspector Pierce says that they are victims of an animal. Meanwhile, Phyllis finds blood on her hands, and her shoes and clothing dirty and she believes that she may be killing people under the influence of a family curse. Who might be the serial-killer?
