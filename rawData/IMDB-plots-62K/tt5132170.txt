In the daily life of 68 year-old Tascha in New York, her deceased mother Enny is still conspicuously present. The death of Enny's first two daughters, 70 years earlier at Auschwitz, seems to make a painfull and unbreakable link between Enny and Tascha. The filmmaker follows both his aunt Tascha as his step grandmother Enny, shortly before she passes away. At the age of 97, Enny surprises him with pre-war footage of her first daughters Glenda and Myrna.
