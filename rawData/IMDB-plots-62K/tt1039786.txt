After he loses his high-paying job, Dory takes a gig as a night janitor in order to pay rent. Alone late at night inside a market research firm, he soon discovers the company is experimenting on their other janitors ...
Dory, a computer programmer experiencing a crisis of faith, is laid off from his suit-and-tie job and must resort to cleaning toilets with a brown-collar band of janitorial misfits. Unbeknownst to him, he is made the subject of a bizarre experiment involving deliciously addictive cookies that simulate oven freshness by warming in your mouth when eaten. It turns out that the cookies cause spectacular visions, wild mood swings, and quasi-pregnancies in the male janitors. The men must pull together to become midwives for one another as each gives birth to a small, beautiful, immaculately conceived blue fish.
