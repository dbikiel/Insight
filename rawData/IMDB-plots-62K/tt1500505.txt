Stark Raving Black Productions proudly presents the comedy of Lewis Black in 80 minutes of outrageous topical stand-up humor. Shot at the historic Fillmore Theatre in Detroit, Stark Raving Black features Lewis Black serving up his blistering social and political commentary on current events. The movie is the culmination of his very best material from his sold-out shows throughout North America and Europe in 2009.
