Having left New Hampshire over excessive demands by the locals, the cast and crew of "The Old Mill" moves their movie shoot to a small town in Vermont. However, they soon discover that The Old Mill burned down in 1960, the star can't keep his pants zipped, the starlet won't take her top off, and the locals aren't quite as easily conned as they appear.
Chaos ensues for a film production in a small Vermont town after the discovery of one of the town's landmarks burned down years ago. A moralistic screenwriter may have to put his career ahead of his principles. An authoritative director and his fast talking producer struggle to keep the production together, while the leading actors have their own problems. The leading man has a penchant for young girls while the woman has a problem showing nudity on screen.
