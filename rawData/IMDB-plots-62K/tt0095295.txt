This is a cinematic adaptation of the autobiography of Anna Wimschneider. It depicts her life's experiences and workaday routines as a woman born on a farm in lower Bavaria, Germany, in the 1920s. Anna's mother died early in child-bed and since then Anna had to take her place and work very hard. On a Nazi rally she meets young Albert, who owns a farm. They realize that they both don't believe into fascism, and go off for a coffee bar, where he starts wooing her. Against her prior decision to leave the farm-life as soon as possible, she agrees to marry him, in the hope that her life will become easier on Albert's farm.
