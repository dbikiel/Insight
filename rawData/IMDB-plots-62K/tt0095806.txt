A young Jewish adolescent from an overbearing family likes a Christian girl and is helped by a fun-loving rabbi.
Maximilian Glick is an ordinary Jewish kid in a 1950's small town in Manitoba, Canada. Unfortunately, he is also saddled with overbearing parents, who are intent on railroading his life to meet their expectations of him. The most obvious examples are giving him a piano when he really wanted a bike and pushing him to study for his Bar Mitzfah. Unfortunately, both paths get bumpy when he is partnered with a Christian girl for duo piano playing. His prejudiced parents forbid Max to see her, and his rabbi is killed in an accident. That leads to the appointment of Rabbi Teitelman, an orthodox jew with a unorthodox fun loving look on life. Together, the two must find a way to fulfill their dreams and their own identities in a world that seems dead set against them doing that.
