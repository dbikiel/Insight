A popular singer with two identities falls in love with a prostitute.
Jordan-based Rajiv Behl falls head-over-heels in love with Nargis Bano. He is warned to stay away from her by a male companion, Sadiq, but persists, even after being told that she is a courtesan who will be performing next in Dubai's Hotel Crowne Plaza. Rajiv follows her there, converses with her, and learns that she is from Lahore, Pakistan. Ignoring warnings from U.K.-based Avtar Singh, he then travels to Heera Mandi in Lahore where he will only be permitted to see her for a few nights for a fat fee by brothel madame, Zohra Bano. But nothing will prevent Rajiv from the heartbreak he will experience after Nargis finds out who he really is and why anyone, who even comes close to him, is brutally killed.
