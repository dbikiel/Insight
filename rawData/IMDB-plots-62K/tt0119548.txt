San Francisco is a little city, where you keep running into the same 6 people, here 5 around 30 y.o. and a cougar on the prowl for young women, all going in and out of relationships.
Adam is a painter who works as cab driver and blames his difficulties with women on his former girlfriend Kate who left him for lesbian Anne. As a result he doesn't pay much attention to his current girlfriend Nina, who leaves him for his best friend Kevin. New girl in town, Rebecca, who works in the same bar as Kevin, turns their lives into even bigger chaos.
