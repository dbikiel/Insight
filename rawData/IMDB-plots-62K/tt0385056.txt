Failing to make it on his own, twenty-seven-year-old Jim moves back in with his parents and deals with crippling family obligations.
Jim is a young man who, after deciding he can't make it on his own, moves back to his hometown in Indiana -- under his parents' roof. He's saved from his family's dysfunction by a local woman and her son, who sees him as a father figure.
Jim runs out of money in New York and returns to the small Indiana town he grew up in. He doesn't enjoy being around his family and doesn't want to help out at the family business. After his brother ends up in a coma, he is forced to help out at the ladder factory his parents run. He meets his Uncle Stacey who is using the plant to disguise his drug dealing. Jim meets a beautiful nurse with a precocious son and starts a unsteady romance. Love and patience eventually help him to find some happiness in life.
