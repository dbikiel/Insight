A greedy woman kills her land-owning husband with the aid of her brother. Since the husband's will leaves his land to his nephew, the woman and her brother hire a gunman to eliminate this nephew before he can claim his inheritance. The nephew, however, proves to be a resourceful fighter -- good both with his gun and with his fists -- and he manages not only to close in on his foes but also to form an alliance of sorts with the gunman who's been hired to kill him.
