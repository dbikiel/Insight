Seated in his office in Paris, one day of October 1971, Michel Debr√©, minister of the Defence declares: We choose the Larzac as it is a deprived land. With no prior dialogue, his decision to extend the military camp of the Larzac is made. The first reaction of the peasants is radical: "If they want our farms and lands, we'll leave them dead and we won't be the only dead around" He sets an unanimous wave of protestations and resistances; the beginning of an amazing struggle, that will last for ten years until the elections for Presidency of May 1981
How did a group of isolated farmers, clueless about politics, manage to win a fight against the French government's decision to extend a military camp over their land? Deep in the French countryside, 103 families made an oath to unite and defend their land. As a result, this small area became the birthplace of the anti-globalization movement in France. Yet they did not use weapons to defend themselves, only tractors and sheep. This documentary focuses on the inhabitants' 10-year long struggle for justice and freedom.
