Terrorist Jaffad Ben Zayidi steals four nuclear bombs from a sunken American submarine and hides them in four major cities throughout the world. The charges can be activated by an 11-digit code. Zayidi dies and his accomplice, nicknamed "The Executioner," is about to blow up the bombs. The Executioner is chased by FSB, whose agent Marie has previously infiltrated Zayidi's team.
Nukes recovered from a sunken U.S. submarine have been planted in four largest cities of the world by a terrorist Jaffad Ben Zaydi. A code of fourteen numbers and a single phone call can trigger them any moment - this is the Apocalypse Code.
An agent of the Russian FSB Darya Vyacheslavovna (Anastasya Zavorotnyuk) infiltrates the terrorist organization and vitnesses the killing of Jaffad, who at his last breath tells her that the code has been divided to three trusted persons.
Jaffad's partner "The Executioner" /Palach/ is determined to find them and trigger the nukes, so is Darya - to prevent it. They both begin their search for the code around the world, whereas one cannot harm another - they both have parts of it which the other doesn't.
