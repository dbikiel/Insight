A tenacious daughter and an expert boatman are more than eager to prolong their parents' irreconcilable feud; however, an untimely demise will only make things worse. Can a humble priest help them bury the hatchet--and, maybe--find love?
A young and brave girl decides to continue her father's trade, carrying people and things with his boat. Thus she will be able to feed her 6 brothers/sisters. However the islanders do not trust a woman to carry them: they prefer her father's competitor, another boatman. In despair, Madalena decides to marry someone she doesn't love, while in reality she loves another man. The priest once more plays a significant role. He intercedes and the right couple get married.
A long-standing and irreconcilable feud between two local ferrymen, Captain Kosmas and Yorgaras Yokaris, splits the peaceful community of a small and picturesque Cycladic island. But, with their offspring and young apprentices--Madalena, a tenacious and optimistic daughter; and Labis, a harsh and expert boatman--more than eager to prolong their parents' bitter conflict, an untimely demise will only incur the heavy responsibility of providing for an already multitudinous and poor family; nevertheless, who would trust a young captain? Sooner or later, things are bound to take a turn for the worse; however, can a humble but well-respected priest help the two impassioned seafarers bury the hatchet--and, maybe--find love?
