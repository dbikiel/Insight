The father of a terminally ill girl is determined to grant his daughter's last wish, a ridiculously expensive collectors' costume from a Japanese TV series. The request will drive him into a journey within his city's dark underbelly.
Luis, an unemployed literature teacher, is determined to grant what may be the last wish of Alicia, his 12-year-old daughter who is suffering from terminal leukemia: she dreams of owning the costume of Magical Girl Yukiro, her anime star. Unfortunately, the price tag is far beyond his means. But Luis is not one to give up easily, even if it means... abuse or blackmail.
