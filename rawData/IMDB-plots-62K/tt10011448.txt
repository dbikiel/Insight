With one of the most memorably stunning voices that has ever hit the airwaves, Linda Ronstadt burst onto the 1960s folk rock music scene in her early twenties.
Focusing largely on her career including being the first bona fide female rock star, the life of Linda Ronstadt is presented. That path from her upbringing outside of Tucson, Arizona with European and Mexican heritage to that stardom having moved to Los Angeles to pursue that singing career is shown, with commentary not only from her own lips, but that of many of her contemporaries who were also emerging at the same time. Her own sensibilities as a woman in a profession dominated by men affected not only the way she acted within that environment, but also impacted the face of rock music especially as it related to women. Her move out of rock music to other genres in getting back to other types of music with which she grew up is also presented, she being told told time and time again that such moves would ruin her career, but the contrary eventually happening with she and the music with each move being met with critical acclaim and popular appeal. These genres included light operetta in the form of Gilbert and Sullivan (most specifically The Pirates of Penzanze), pop standards in collaboration with Nelson Riddle, a purely country collaboration with old friend Emmylou Harris and new friend Dolly Parton, a pop music collaboration with Aaron Neville, and a recording of traditional Spanish-language Mexican folk songs. Not being a songwriter but owning whatever song she decided to sing, and the reason for her retirement in 2009, when she gave her last concert, are also discussed. And two of her higher profile romantic relationships, to fellow musician JD Souther and then California Governor Jerry Brown, are also touched upon.
