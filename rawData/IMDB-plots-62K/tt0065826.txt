A government agent tries to break a Neo-Fascist group in California
A group of sadistic outlaw bikers rumble into Las Vegas for kicks and to raise hell and chaos. But they soon get more then they bargained for when they run up against a neo-Nazi group, as well as casino Mafia wise-guys, and a wannabe vampire.
Mark Adams is a deep-undercover agent working for Las Vegas mobster Joe Bremonte who is in league with a shady neo-Nazi named Count von Delberg whom is working to bring in counterfeit money in the USA to fund the Nazi party in Germany. Adams handlers Brand and Jill Harmon are forced by their boss, Gavin, to take down the entire operation when it seems that the Count will be leaving the country. The Count is also in league with a lethal group of outlaw motorcyclists, the Bloody's Devils, under the command of Cluck, to do their dirty work for them. The Count's emissary, Carol, is an undercover agent of her own for the Israeli government with her own agenda to take down the Count, while she also deals with the sadistic Bloody Devils and keeps them in line with large bribes of cash, until they get greedy and demand more then that. Everybody among all this had a hidden agenda, and it could spell trouble for all involved.
