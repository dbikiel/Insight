A lawyer is hired to defend an old college friend accused of murdering her husband.
The lawyer Thelma "T.K." Knudsen Katwuller is having a love affair with her client, Steven Seldes, accused of making under-age porn movies through the Blue Screen Production. When T.K. meets her old college friend Ellie Seldes, she finds that she is Steven's wife and Ellie invites T.K. to have dinner with her family at her home. T.K. decides to break-up with Steven and he asks her to meet him in his office. While waiting for Steven, T.K. finds that he owns the Blue Screen Production and had lied to her. The next morning, Ellie is arrested and accused of murdering her husband and Ellie hires T.K. to defend her. Detective Beutel feels that something is missing in the case.
Lawyer T.K. represents Steven Seldes who claims he is innocent of involvement in making under-age porn movies. He is also her lover, so when she meets his wife things are awkward for her - he didn't say he was married and his wife turns out to be an old student friend. Next day she confronts him at his office and a fight ensues.
