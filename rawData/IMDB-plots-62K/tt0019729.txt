A pair of sisters from the vaudeville circuit try to make it big time on Broadway, but matters of the heart complicate the attempt.
Hank and Queenie Mahoney, a vaudeville act, come to Broadway, where their friend Eddie Kerns needs them for his number in one of Francis Zanfield's shows. Eddie was in love with Hank, but when he meets Queenie, he falls in love to her, but she is courted by Jock Warriner, a member of the New Yorker high society. It takes a while till Queenie recognizes, that she is for Jock nothing more than a toy, and it also takes a while till Hank recognizes that Eddie is in love with Queenie.
Vaudeville sisters "Hank" and Queenie Mahoney take their act to the Broadway stage in New York when Eddie, a professional song-and-dance man appearing in a new show, invites his girlfriend Hank to join him. Soon after, Eddie transfers his affections to Queenie, who attempts to do right by her sister by dating another man -- high society member Jock Warriner. The showbiz melodrama is quickly overshadowed by the romantic subplot.
