He is also hopelessly addicted to internet pornography. The object of Bill's lustful obsession is webcam vixen Dani Darling. He spends his nights secretly entranced by her scintillating images, keeping his illicit fantasies hidden from his wife and family. One day, new student Marissa Weaver transfers into Bill's Monday-Wednesday biology class. There's something very familiar about her. Bill comes to suspect that normal college student Marissa Weaver may lead a secret private life as Dani Darling. His pathological desire to find the truth leads him down a destructive spiral of perverse sexual obsession.
