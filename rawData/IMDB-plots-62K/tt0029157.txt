Bob is a struggling artist who paints for his own amusement. Julie is a rich society girl. When they meet, it is cute and they are soon married. Living in a small apartment with the constant company of close friend Oscar, they are poor, but happy. When the papers run the story about his riot in the park, Bob is suddenly news. With his private showing he becomes the society's newest sensation. Bob becomes serious, devoid of fun and adventure. Money becomes his prime concern and all the introductions are handled by Lilly. But this is not the life that either Julie or Oscar want.
Despite the differences in their class and economic standing, poor struggling artist Bob Graham and socialite Julie Stoddard fall in love at first sight and quickly get married. Julie loves not only Bob's art but also his conviction of painting for his own vision and not for anyone else's who can afford to pay for their vision to be realized by him. Having lived off the wealth of her uncle, Julie renounces that wealth to live off what Bob earns, and to live with him in his cramped New York City fourth floor walk-up studio apartment with his roommate cum mascot, Oscar, a dipsomaniac. Through roundabout means, Bob comes to the attention of Mr. Bawltitude, a renowned art gallery owner who can see that Bob has talent. It is through Bawltitude that Bob achieves a modicum of success. But through Bawltitude, Bob also comes to the attention of Lily Chalmers, Julie's socialite friend, who introduces Bob to their fellow socialite friends who will pay for Bob to create their artistic wants, however crass or commercial. The issue is that Bob gets accustomed to what money can buy. Bob and Julie's marriage may not be able to survive this change as this new Bob is not the man with who Julie fell in love.
