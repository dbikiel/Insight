A talented young actress seems to be under the spell of her unscrupulous, avaricious, and totally unprincipled husband.
Actress Jessica Wells, sister of actor Damon Wells, is on top of her form except when her husband Vance is around. When Vance takes her to the apartment of a theatrical producer she comes home incoherent and Vance is found dead in the vanished producer's hotel suite.
