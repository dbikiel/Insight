After a bad breakup, Zoe Smallman decides to take down her ex-boyfriend in a wizard rock battle of the bands.
Zoe and Peter have just broken up - not only breaking her heart as he hooks up with a girl called Macy, but also ending their successful "wizard rock" duo, performing songs inspired by Harry Potter fan fiction. Zoe's best friend Charlie has also split up with his partner, Laurel, and is now trying to get over her by getting rid of all the things that remind him of their love - items he keeps in his ex-box (trademark dispute still being resolved). Despite wanting just to mope, Zoe engages Charlie's help to write a song which she can perform at the Wizard Rock Battle of the Bands, where she can show the crowd and Peter that she is totally over him and that he made a mistake.
