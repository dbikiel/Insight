Maggie Cooper thinks it would be so cool if her son Lloyd were gay. So cool in fact that she signs him up for a college scholarship for gay kids, sets him up on dates and then for good measure outs him to the entire school. And then Lloyd meets a girl.
Even with good intentions and an abundance of love, parents can sometimes become...smothering. Such is the case with Maggie, who decides that she would not only accept her son Lloyd as gay, she would encourage it. In fact, Maggie becomes so convinced that Lloyd is indeed gay that she "outs" him to his entire high school. Like any good "helicopter mom" Maggie hovers over every aspect of her son's life. She takes control of his social life, sets him up on dates with boys whom she has approved, and files for a gay student college scholarship. There's just one wrench in her grand plans: Lloyd doesn't even know whether he's gay or not - and he's just asked a cute girl to prom. In the end, will Maggie be willing to accept her son for who he is-or just who she thinks he is?
Maggie Cooper thinks it would be really cool if her son, Lloyd, was gay. So cool in fact, she outs him to the entire school, sets him up on dates and signs him up for a college scholarship for gay kids. The only problem is that Lloyd himself isn't entirely sure that it is true...
