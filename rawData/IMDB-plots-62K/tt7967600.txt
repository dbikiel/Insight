Classical Period is a portrait of Cal and his friends in Philadelphia. They meet and have long conversations about books, poetry, music, and architecture, most notably Henry Longfellow's 1864 translation of Dante's Divine Comedy . Filmed in rich, grainy 16mm color, the film forefronts character and portraiture, leaving the artificial trappings of narrative cinema behind.
