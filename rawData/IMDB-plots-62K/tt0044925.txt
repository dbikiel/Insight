The mysterious figure known as the Vampire comes to England to complete experiments in his mad bid to gain control of the world. When the radar-controlled Robot which he had ordered shipped to him is delivered instead to Mother Riley, the Vampire, through radar control, has the Robot transport itself as well as Mother Riley to the proper destination...as the old lady goes into a whirl of side-splitting action in a determined effort to frustrate the plans of the sinister Vampire.
Exuberant story of how Mother Riley gets caught up with maniacal scientist trying to get possession of map of uranium deposit. As in other films of the series, production relies primarily on Arthur Lucan's celebrated dame act with its well-tried slapstick, teamed in this case with the amusing melodramatics of Bela Lugosi. The comedy is largely a matter of Mother Riley's preposterous antics in the scientist's sinister house, complete with secret passages, sliding panels and towering robot...Reliable entertainment for Mother Riley fans.
