Two filmmakers leave to Macao in an adventure of discovery of a city-labyrinth, multicultural and mysterious, where the memories of the childhood - featured memories by the lived reality in Macao - have a dialog with the memories of the East built by the codes of the cinema and the literature - memories lived on a featured reality-, creating a testimony which tries to raise the veil on the past and the present time. A personal album of physical and emotional geography, structured as an investigation disguised as a thriller, where the puzzle of the history challenges the reality.
Thirty years later I'm on my way to Macao where I haven't been since I was a child. I got an e-mail, in Lisbon, from Candy, a friend I hadn't heard from in ages. She told me that she had been involved yet again with the wrong men and asked me to go to Macao where "strange and scary things" were happening. Tired, after a long flight, I'm approaching Macao aboard the jetfoil which will take me back to the happiest time in
my life.Trinta anos depois, estou a caminho de Macau, onde não voltava desde criança. Recebi um e-mail, em Lisboa, da Candy, uma amiga da qual não sabia nada há anos. Ela contou-me que se tinha envolvido uma vez mais com os homens errados e pediu-me que fosse para Macau, onde "coisas estranhas e assustadoras" estavam a acontecer. Cansado, depois de um longo voo, chego a Macau a bordo do barco que me levará de volta ao tempo mais feliz da minha vida.
