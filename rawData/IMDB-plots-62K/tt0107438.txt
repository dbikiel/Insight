The dogs can talk at a family of 4, where mom loses her job the same day dad gets a job as pilot for a cute, single boss.
In this, the third film, it's the pets who do the talking. The Ubriacco's find themselves the owners of two dogs, Rocks, a street wise cross breed, and Daphne, a spoiled pedigree poodle. James has a new job, pilot to the sexy and lonely Samantha. Mollie's just lost hers and is stuck at home.
With Christmas just around the corner, the big brother, Mikey, and his little sister, Julie, both want a dog, as Mollie finds herself without a job. Now, James becomes the family's breadwinner, working as a private pilot for the glamorous and seductive cosmetic tycoon, Samantha; however--as James spends more and more time with his sultry boss--his marriage will be put to the test. This time, it's Mikey's shaggy mongrel, Rocks, and Julie's sophisticated poodle, Daphne, who do all the talking, while in the meantime, jealousy gets the best of Mollie. Will the Ubriacco's survive Christmas?
Mikey and Julie are now older and no longer dubbed in this, the third film of the series. Mollie and James are still together and raising the children on their own. Mollie is no longer working for the same firm, and James has landed a terrific job as a private pilot to a sexy business woman, Samantha, who is after James. Two new additions arrive in the family in the form of dogs, Rocks and Daphne. More tension forms with the arrival of the dogs, and it looks uncertain if Mollie and James will remain together.
