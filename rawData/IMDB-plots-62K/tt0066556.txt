A young employee in a Munich travel agency takes a man friend along to Velden, a resort in which he has to settle a business matter. Through a number of misunderstandings the two men do not arrive at the resort at the expected time, nor are they registered in their own name but rather as Mrs. Himmelreich and her secretary. Disguised as these eccentric ladies they manage to turn the hotel and resort upside down in no time at all.
