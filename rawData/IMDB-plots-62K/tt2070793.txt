RIDE REPORT is a feature length documentary that follows two young men on a motorcycle journey spanning 10000 miles through Central and South America. It explores how the modern day traveler is readily connected to a burgeoning global social network through subcultures such as adventure riding and couch surfing. The film is also meant to appeal to a mass audience longing to embark on such a journey themselves.
