Sarah and Bram's road trip takes a horrifying turn when they stop for a break in the dark woods of Wallonia.
It's been a lengthy and exhausting road trip through Wallonia's tree-shaded back roads, and now that night has come, Sarah and Bram need to make a stop for a bathroom break. Soon, the couple finds a remote public restroom in the middle of the gloomy thick woods, unaware, however, that someone, or better still, something is lurking in the shadows. Should they wait until morning or should they just go ahead and use it? After all, who knows if they'll get another opportunity. Obviously, everything in life is only a matter of choice.
