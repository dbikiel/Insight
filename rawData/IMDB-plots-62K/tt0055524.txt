The trials and tribulations of bitter veteran Captain Maddocks and argumentative rookie Lieutenant McQuade at a cavalry desert outpost.
Captain Maddocks will never be promoted beyond Captain because of a mistake that he made in the past. Lt.

Once Maddocks has no other choice than use McQuade against the Indian danger, desert patrol life proves to be a hard school but Curtis is a good pupil...
