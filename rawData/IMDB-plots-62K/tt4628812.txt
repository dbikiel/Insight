A story about an aspiring professional singer and a rock singer who collaborates in a song. As they work on their song, they start to develop feelings for each other.
What if you have a dream and that dream leads you to love? In Dan Villegas The Breakup Playlist, Trixie David (Sarah Geronimo), a law student (by her parents especially her mothers choice) and hopeful musician, catches the attention of popular rock star Gino Avila (Piolo Pascual) during a music camp and invites her to be part of his band. Trixie and Ginos connection through music soon develops into something more, and they fall in love. However, personal issues and ambition challenge Trixie and Ginos love for each other. Will they be able to hold on to their love forever? Or will it, just like any song, end eventually? The Breakup Playlist also stars Maris Racal, Diego Loyzaga, Dennis Padilla, Rio Locsin, and Anna Luna, and features appearances by real-life musicians and producers.
