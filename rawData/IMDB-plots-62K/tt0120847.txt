Professional mercenary Karl Thomasson arrives in Brooklyn to attend the funeral of his brother Randall, who was murdered while trying to stop a carjacking that has been blamed on the "Brotherhood", a vicious street gang led by "Little B." Karl, who believes there is something more to it, goes undercover as Randall's replacement at Lenthrop High School in Brooklyn, where Randall was a history teacher, so Karl can investigate the Brotherhood. Karl becomes the protector of Randall's daughter Anya when their lives are threatened by whoever is behind the recent string of carjackings, and the plot behind the carjackings runs a lot deeper than the Brotherhood, and the threat is a lot closer to Karl and Anya than they dare to think.
In Brooklyn, New York City, Randall Thomasson is murdered while attempting to avoid a carjacking. His brother Karl Thomasson, who is a veteran mercenary, attends the funeral and meets his estranged niece Anya. Karl decides to pose as history teacher to replace his brother at the high-school and investigate his death. Karl also teams up with the also mercenary Joey 6 to investigate the gang The Brotherhood that is blamed for the murder. The teacher Kara Lavelle helps Karl in the investigation and he is hired by the school. Karl finds violent and disrespectful students in class and protects Anya, while has a love affair with Kara. He also befriends a school janitor that is also a war veteran. Soon Karl discovers that The Brotherhood is using the school to disassemble stolen cars to sell and that the school's auto-repair teacher Warren Drummond is one of the leaders of the gang. The school becomes no mans land.
