Laurel and Hardy's bid for a quiet evening of checkers and pool is constantly interrupted by their squabbling brats little Ollie and little Stanley.
Stanley and Oliver are trying to spend a relaxing night at home playing checkers, but the antics of their mischievous sons keep interrupting their recreation. Exasperated, the fathers send their misbehaving offspring to bed and start in on a furniture-destroying game of billiards. Upstairs, the kids continue to cause a ruckus and leave the bathtub faucet running full force. Finally, Oliver asks if they'll go to sleep if he gives them each a drink of water, then heads for the bathroom door.
