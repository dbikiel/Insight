A young couple decides to give each other a night off, no questions asked.
In Los Angeles, Annie and Darren are a married couple in a comfortable relationship that's lost its spark. They talk constantly, express affection verbally, start the day with high-end coffee, end the afternoon with gelato, shop at the farmer's market, prepare dinner as a team, do crossword puzzles, and talk in bed. Darren wonders if a one-night stand would help bring more sex to their marriage. Soon, the two of them are laying out the ground rules and talking through the mechanics of each finding a lover for one night. They agree to give each other no details about the experience. The night comes. Will this give their relationship a needed boost?
Darren and Annie have an enviable relationship built on love, trust, and communication. After seven years of marriage, they wouldnt change their relationship one bit. They still enjoy each others company and laugh at each others jokes, but, unfortunately, they cant remember the last time they had sex. When a dinner party conversation leads to an honest discussion about the state of their love life, and a bikini photo shoot leads to crossword puzzles instead of sex, they begin to flirt with a way to spice things up. The deal: one night of no-strings-attached sex with a stranger for each of them. Can one night of freedom be just what they need?With a keen eye and fresh take, Katie Aseltons directorial debut shines. The Freebie is an insightful, humorous look at love, sustaining relationships, and the awkwardness of monogamy when the haze of lust has faded.
