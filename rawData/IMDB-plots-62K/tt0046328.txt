In ancient times, a Jew is instrumental in the crowning of a new Median-Persian king who, in return, conquers Babylon and frees all the Jewish slaves.
The Jews are taken from Jerusalem and made slaves by King Nebuchadnezzar. In the meantime Cyrus, king of the Persians, who has been living as a shepherd, is proclaimed king and defeats Nebuchadnezzar.
In 586 BC the city of Jerusalem was destroyed by the armies of king Nebuchadnezzar and its people were brought captive into Babylon. After decades of subjugation by their Babylonian masters, the people are calling out for a saviour. The prophet Daniel dispatches Nahum, one of his faithful followers to search the faraway empire of Media for a young shepherd named Cyrus, who unknowingly is destined to become the king of Persia, and holds the key to the freedom of the Jewish people.
