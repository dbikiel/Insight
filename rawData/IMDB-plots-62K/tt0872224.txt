The movie follows the life of Chicago burglar Kaspar Karr. Kaspar cases and robs stores. He counts up his score and a small interview follows where Kaspar introduces himself. He shows his expertise in social engineering, stalking, and intelligence gathering and discusses his careful, meticulous planning cycles.
In this mockumentary, Chicago area high stakes burglar Kaspar Carr allows Rob Rodgers to film a documentary about him. He allows Rodgers and his team not only to interview him, although certain topics are off limits, but also provides them access to his planning of heists - which can be up to a year in the making and which always includes what is required to case a place he plans to burglarize - and the occasional burglary itself as it happens. As he steals only cash, he focuses on high cash businesses and those that he can easily case without being noticed as suspicious, such as nightclubs and ethnic grocers. But as what Carr is doing is illegal and highly dangerous, the nature of the documentary can turn on a dime in an instant. At Statesville Correctional Center in Joliet, Illinois, Rodgers also interviews Larry Evans who provides his perspective on being a burglar, that perspective which includes currently being behind bars for his crimes.
Casper Karr (Malik Bader) plays a professional thief in this 2006 "mockumentary". Shot in a very realistic style, the film follows Casper to various breaking &amp; entering jobs, detailing the care that goes into casing a job, the tools &amp; preparation that go into the actual job, and the emotional toll that the stress takes. There are several shots with an unidentified man who is serving time in prison, having gotten caught after committing similar crimes. The film ends on a mysterious note, as Casper runs a job on a Russian's nightclub and the thief's car is found, covered in blood, shortly thereafter.
