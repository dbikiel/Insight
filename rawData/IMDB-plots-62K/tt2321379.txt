Eric Swain and Troy Bernier are scientists by day and amateur filmmakers by night. These two friends have worked together for years - turning out sci-fi inspired tales of their own creation. Journey to Planet X follows the filming of Planet X, the duo's most ambitious endeavor to date, and sheds light on their own unique brand of 'movie magic.'
