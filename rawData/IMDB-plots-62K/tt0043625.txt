Nick and his partner Al stage a payroll holdup. Al is shot and Nick kills a policeman. Nick hides out at a public pool, where he meets Peg Dobbs. They go back to her apartment and he forces her family to hide him from the police manhunt.
The uptight and dumb small time thief Nick Robey and his partner and only friend Al Molin steal $10,000.00 from a man, but the heist goes wrong. Al Molin is killed by a policeman and Nick shoots him in the spine. He hides out in a public swimming pool and meets the lonely spinster Peggy Dobbs in the water. Nick uses Peggy to lie low. He offers a ride in a taxi to her and she invites him to her apartment, where she introduces her family to him. When Nick discovers that he killed the cop, he decides to use Peggy's apartment as hideout to wait the police manhunt cool down. When Nick finds that Peggy loves him, he invites her to leave town with him and asks her to buy a used car. However, Nick cannot trust anybody and believes Peggy has betrayed him.
Nick Robey is a two-bit hood, whose insecurity, superstitiousness and skitterishness make him an ineffective criminal. He lives with his slattern of a mother, who doesn't care what happens to him, he in turn who feels the same about her. Nick and his associate Al Molin have planned a targeted mugging, their victim who will be carrying a large cache of cash for a payroll. In the mugging gone wrong, Nick is forced to go on the run, he only remembering Al's advice to blend into the crowd to avoid suspicion and thus capture. In blending into the crowd, Nick meets Peg Dobbs, a working class, inexperienced and thus equally insecure young woman who he, in wooing, believes he can use to his advantage. In the process, Nick meets Peg's parents and her kid brother Tommy with who she lives. Nick and each of the four members of the Dobbs family have to decide how far they will go with the other and/or risk to get out of their respective predicaments, Nick's whose changes with time and the ever changing nature of the outcome of the mugging. The four Dobbs may end up at odds with each other, each who may have a different perspective of what is best for them as a collective.
