Four young friends have tedious night jobs and meet every night after work in a café. Sean hasn't met his girlfriend in three weeks, Vincent flirts with everybody, Lenny is too afraid to ask a girl at work on a date and Jody can't admit that she shows up at the café every night, although she was fired some time ago.
