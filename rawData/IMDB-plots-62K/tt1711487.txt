The summer of 1951 a couple get their first and only child. A boy. Or is it? Ouside the birds stop singing, and there's a solar eclipse. The parents deny an operation which could make Adrian a whole human being.
It's the summer of 1951 in Oslo. Lillian and Amund Wang are blessed with their first and only child. A boy. Or is it a girl? Outside there's a solar eclipse, and all the birds stops singing. Young Adrian isn't getting the operation which might give him the life he deserves in a conservative environment, and the apartment where he grows up becomes a greenhouse for the darkest flowers. Adrian grows up on lies, dying love and shamelessness. At 15 he overhears a conversation between the parents, which makes him attack his parents, and make him dangerous for his surroundings. Adrian takes his shame and guilt, and takes his punishment as a responsibility put upon him.
