A 30-something slacker finds his carefree life turned upside down when he falls for his sister's teenage babysitter.
A 32-year-old waster and eternal student, Thijs, leads a slovenly, relaxed life full of beer, chicks and the occasional shift at a tedious media megastore. When Thijs visits his sister's house to do some washing, instead of his usual encounter with her semi-perfect family, he meets Lisa, the baby-sitter: a mature sixteen-year-old with exorbitant ambitions. Without intending to, Lisa has a profound effect on Thijs, unveiling a deeply ingrained dissatisfaction with his own passive behaviour.
