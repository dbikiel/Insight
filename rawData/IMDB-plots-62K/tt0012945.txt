Buster Keaton shoes horses and repairs cars, with mixed results.
Buster clowns around in a blacksmith's shop until he and the smithy get in a fight which sends the smithy to jail. Buster helps several customers with horses, then destroys a Rolls Royce while fixing the car parked next to it.
Left all alone to run the dark but well-equipped smithy after an intense fight with his irate boss, Buster--an utterly inept blacksmith apprentice--receives his first customer: the proud white mare of the upper-class noblewoman, Virginia. Of course, today of all days, this is the busiest day of the week, and before long, another hurried customer--the affluent but obnoxious owner of a gleaming Rolls-Royce in pristine condition--arrives for a minor repair. What delightful catastrophes await?
