In the absence of a true family, a young skinhead lets his life revolve around his cherished pit bull dog.
Marek has no real friends except his guard dog and hangs out with skinheads. When his dispirited mother reappears in his life, Marek faces a horrible predicament. An authentic and hypnotic chronicle of a sluggish existence always on the verge of explosion.
Abused, neglected, and estranged with his mother for the past eight years, young Marek spends the time attending his father's vineyard, finding comfort in the company of his beloved pit bull dog--the fierce guard, Killer. Undoubtedly, Marek's need to fit in society is constant; nevertheless, in a place where the opportunities are sparse, finding a true friend or having a genuine relationship is a utopia. Under those circumstances, Marek will eventually find his place in the local right-wing club--where he receives attention, understanding, and companionship--as an old debt to his ostracised mother, Marika, leads to an inevitable and forced re-acquaintance. But, in the first place, what was Marika's crime that banished her from the village, and what will be the outcome of such a volatile situation?
