The old King (Vladimír Mensík) is not satisfied with his four children. It is high time for the Princesses to get married and for the Prince to assume the reign. Once the King sets out to the fowling and he entrusts the kingdom to the Prince Velen (Juraj Durdiak). His sisters want him to provide them with the bridegrooms. A beautiful girl Evening Star (Libuse Safránková) appears to Velen and he falls in love with her at once. Evening Star also likes Velen and therefore, for a kiss, she helps him to get married his sisters to her brothers Moonbeam, Sunbeam and Wind. After the King returns home he does not find the daughters because the bridegrooms took them right away. The angry King assigns the Prince to bring them home.
