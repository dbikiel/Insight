British propaganda film from WW2 stressing the importance of the navigator on RAF's bomber crews.
David Wilton (Sir Richard Attenborough), John Aynesworth (Jack Watling), and Smith (David Tomlinson) are amongst a group of cadets hoping to become pilots in the Royal Air Force. David, however, has poor height perception and cannot master his landings. Therefore, he is sent to navigator's school, but finds it hard to concentrate on his new job due to despondency over losing his chance to be "something important", a pilot. His friends and teachers join in an effort to show David the vast importance of the navigator, something he learns for himself over the target city of Berlin.
Royal Air Force Bomber Command during the early days of World War II shown through the story of three young men, who all dream of becoming pilots. From the first day of call up, to basic training, then the Empire training scheme in Canada, and finally joining a squadron and forming into a crew.
