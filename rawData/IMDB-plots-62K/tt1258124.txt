Brian, an American businessman, is sent to Thailand in search of local coffee plantations to purchase, but he ends up finding more than just coffee, and that the original purpose of the trip might not even be about coffee after all.
American businessman Brian Chandler has a perfect life with a great job and beautiful fianc√©e. When his boss, renegade coffee mogul Calvert Jenkins sends him to Thailand to inspect a crop for purchase, Brian meets Ticha, a beautiful Bangkok executive who has long-since given up on the prospects of finding love. At the urging of her old village and her coffee farmer parents, Ticha brings Brian to the coffee fields of Southern Krabi, with the hopes that Brian will purchase coffee there. The only problem with this plan is that Brian and Ticha absolutely can not stand to be around each other. As they go from the cosmopolitan bustle of Bangkok to the pristine, white sands beaches of Krabi, their relationship becomes more than just a coffee deal.
