A profile of homeless Romanian children who were born victims of the nation's reckless population growth policy during its communist era.
One of the most astonishing and engaging cinematic works of the past decade, CHILDREN UNDERGROUND is a profoundly intimate and heart-wrenching drama about homeless children struggling for survival on the streets and in the subways of Bucharest, Romania.
Makers of documentary went to live with parentless children in Bucharest underground. Movie shows number of lost children struggling through everyday life full of violence, illnes, petty crime and hopefuly at some point of the day inhaling glue or paint.
