General Othello (Sir Anthony Hopkins) becomes convinced that his wife is having an affair, even though there is no evidence.
Iago (Bob Hoskins) and a comrade-in-arms are outside the Venice home of Desdemona's father, Brabantio (Geoffrey Chater), who does not yet know that she has eloped with Othello (Sir Anthony Hopkins). Iago confides to his friend, who had hoped to marry Desdemona (Dame Penelope Wilton), that he serves Othello to further his own ends. Venice needs Othello to protect its commercial interests in Cyprus where the Turkish fleet is headed. Desdemona insists on going to Cyprus, too. In Cyprus, Iago plots to convince Othello that Desdemona has betrayed him with Cassio (David Yelland). A lot more than political ambition seems to be motivating Iago.
Desdemona (Dame Penelope Wilton) defies her father, Brabantio (Geoffrey Chater), to marry the Moor of Venice, the mighty warrior, Othello (Sir Anthony Hopkins). But Iago (Bob Hoskins), (Othello's old Lieutenant) doesn't like Cassio (David Yelland), (Othello's new Lieutenant), and he plans, with the help of his wife Emilia (Rosemary Leach), to destroy Cassio and Othello through Othello's feelings for Desdemona.
