In old New Orleans, a beautiful adventuress juggles the attentions of a rich banker and a dashing sea captain.
French farce comes to the New World in 1840 as Claire Ledoux convinces the middle-aged banker who is her fiance that she is two different women -- a deception made necessary by the arrival of a man acquainted with the swath she cut across Europe. Giraud has been about to foreclose on a $150 loan made to a sea captain who needed the funds to court Claire. Get Claire's "cousin" out of New Orleans before the wedding, Giraud tells the sea captain and the debt will be paid.
In 1841 New Orleans, beautiful adventuress Claire Ledoux schemes to marry wealthy banker Giraud; but in the intervals, she sees no harm in dalliance with poor but handsome sea captain Robert Latour. Her plots have ups and downs, become more involved, and, naturally, backfire.
