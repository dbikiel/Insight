Lecherous bosses make it difficult for an attractive secretary to keep jobs, so she decides to appear considerably more homely in hopes of holding onto work.
Marge is a capable secretary, but her bosses are more interested in her than her abilities. This causes her to be frequently unemployed. To get a job, she changes her look to make herself unattractive. This gets her work with a writer named Freddy, who has a deadline fast approaching for his new book. Unfortunately, Freddy takes every opportunity not to work on the book and even falls for Marge when he sees her as she really looks. But as the unattractive secretary, he barely notices her and she tries everything to get him to complete his book on time.
A plain-Jane secretary becomes a beauty to win her boss' heart.
