A cloistered, overprotected Austrian prince falls in love with a down-to-earth barmaid in this "Viennese fairy tale."
Young Prince Karl Heinrich has spent his entire life behind the palace gates protected from the world. He has been raised in a melancholy atmosphere of strict discipline and duty, yet he often looks out at the frolics of youths and maidens who live beyond the walls. When he passes his exams, Karl is sent to Heidelberg to complete his studies. It is a heady new world of brew, song, and comradeship. Karl falls in love with Kathi, a pretty barmaid, and she reciprocates. But can the love survive their disparate backgrounds? Will Karl ever find happiness or will duty deny it to him?
Crown Prince Karl Heinrich is the nephew of Karl VII, the current King of Karlsburg, and first in line for the throne. The only companion the Prince has growing up is his tutor, Dr. Jüttner. After the Prince receives the equivalent of a high school diploma, the King decides to send him to Heidelberg to continue his education, with Dr. Jüttner as his chaperon. There, he's made arrangements to stay at a modest inn. Although when they arrive and see that the inn's rooms are not up to royal standards, the Prince decides to stay anyway if only because of the innkeeper's pretty niece, Kathi. The Prince loves the collegial atmosphere in Heidelberg, this being the first time he's ever experienced such, but he loves Kathi even more, and she him. But when it looks as if he is required to take his rightful place on the throne which includes marrying the woman the King has chosen for him, the Princess Ilse of Altenberg, the Prince has to make the difficult decision between his royal duties and his love for Kathi. The decision is made all the more difficult without being able to get the advice of those closest to him.
