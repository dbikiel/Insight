"Neues Kino movie" about life in the circus dome narrated in Brechtian spirit; deceptively illusionist grip is broken violently by aloofness, sweeping subjective tracking shots interrupted by a flat snapshot of an old stick, calm color sequence stops up a moving black and white scene and interviewed people in close-up becomes suddenly silent. Kluge has also taken a different motto from Brecht to heart, namely, that the artist's task is to maintain: despite its ambiguity "Circus performers" in a somewhat simplified format, could have been a film for children.
