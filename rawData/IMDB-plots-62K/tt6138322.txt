Iggy Pop narrates - in simple childlike verse - Nothing's weekend on Earth.
A whistleblowing documentary parody, not exactly in prose, wherein Nothing tries to defend its cause. Brainstormed and filmed by 62 cinematographers in 70 countries, scored by cabaret grandmasters Pascal Comelade and The Tiger Lillies, narrated - in simple childish verse - by Iggy Pop.
