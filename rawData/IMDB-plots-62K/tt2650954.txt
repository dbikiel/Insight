Sascha lives in a village on the Kola Peninsular in northern Russia and dedicatedly manages what is left of an old collective farm. He gets on well with his farm workers who respect him and tolerate his clandestine love-affair with Anya.
The young businessman Sasha is presented with a choice: having received compensation, to leave peacefully the adjusted economy and to go to the city with the girlfriend or to enter dangerous fight against new owners to assert the rights of the people living on his earth.
