A German documentary filmmaker travels to Madrid to do a TV program about the city and the Spanish civil war commemorating its 50th anniversary.
A young student interviews a bitter old journalist, who has agreed to this in hopes of seducing her. When the interview moves from a public restaurant to a private residence owned by a friend of the journalist, they end up naked and trapped in a bathroom. In the hours that follow, the journalist alternates between repeated seduction attempts and giving the student cynical advice on her life and career.
