A single mom and her child are carjacked by a bank robber.
The divorced Lorraine Burton is an insecure woman that raises her seven year-old son Chad alone and without money. Her ex-husband Gary is a former military that went in court martial and presses Lorraine to take Chad for him. One day, Lorraine stops her car in a gas station after her therapy to buy frozen pizzas for Chad and her. When she returns, the bank robber Roy carjacks them and heads to Tijuana, Mexico with Lorraine and Chad. Along their journey, Lorraine tries to protect Chad from the psychopath Roy.
The conclusion to the movie provides a surprising twist as Loraine goes from being frightened, cautious and timid to actually being on the aggression in a sense.
