After being forced into a marriage and enduring a humiliating work routine in the hands of his father-in-law, Zé Araújo becomes the mythical Ojuara, an unconventional hero devoted to debauchery.
In the Northeastern of Brazil, the wolf traveling salesman of fabric José Araújo arrives at Jardim dos Caiacós and succeeds in selling his merchandise to the Turkish Turco. He goes to a ball to celebrate the business and he meets Dualiba, the forty and something year-old virgin daughter of Turco. He shags Dualiba and she tells her father what happened, and José Araújo is forced to marry her. When the resigned Araújo discovers that he is the motive of joke in the town, he changes his name to Ojuara and becomes a fearless lonely rider though the countryside of Northeastern to the paradisiacal São Sarué. Along his journey, his name becomes a legend that has defeated the devil and many bullies. He meets the gorgeous Jacirene a.k.a. Genifer in a brothel; the circus acrobat in the trapeze Sue; the evil Mãe de Pantanha and her "vagina dentata" ("toothed vagina"); and the daughter of a powerful farmer Eleonora.
