An uptight English writer travelling to Crete, on a matter of business, finds his life changed forever when he meets the gregarious Alexis Zorba.
An aimless English writer finds he has a small inheritance on a Greek island. His joyless existence is disturbed when he meets Zorba, a middle aged Greek with a real lust for life. As he discovers the earthy pleasures of Greece, the Englishman finds his view on life changing.
An Englishman, Basil, is en route to Crete where he owns a long-disused mine. Along the way, he encounters, befriends, and employs Zorba. Once in Crete, they set about trying to get the mine operational. Basil is quite risk averse, studious, and introverted, while Zorba is extroverted, gregarious, happy-go-lucky, and lives life to the fullest. Over time, Zorba's zestfulness starts to rub off on Basil.
Travelling to inspect an abandoned mine his father owns in Crete, English author Basil meets the exuberant peasant Zorba and invites him along when the older man claims he has mining experience. In Basil's father's old village, he finds himself attracted to a young widow, and Zorba takes up with the woman who runs their hotel. When things go wrong, Zorba teaches Basil how to enjoy life even under the most trying circumstances.
