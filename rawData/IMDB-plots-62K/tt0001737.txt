Cartoon figures announce, via comic strip balloons, that they will move - and move they do, in a wildly exaggerated style.
Cartoonist Winsor McCay agrees to create a large set of drawings that will be photographed and made into a motion picture. The job requires plenty of drawing supplies, and the cartoonist must also overcome some mishaps caused by an assistant. Finally, the work is done, and everyone can see the resulting animated picture.
At the club, Winsor McCay with a party of boon friends, is engaged in a friendly game, the subject of moving pictures is broached, the game is forgotten and the discussion becomes quite animated and interesting. One of the fellows asks Winsor why he has never been able to make moving pictures; he replies that he feels positive he can produce drawings that will move, and wagers that he will make four thousand pen drawings inside of one month that will move as actively and as life-like as anything ever reproduced by the camera, and surpass in their performance anything ever seen. His companions laugh at him and tell him he is getting foolish in his "noodle." One month later, he has the four thousand drawings ready for the Vitagraph Company's camera and invites his club friends to come and see him make good. They arrive and he shows them drawings of some of the leading characters of his "Little Nemo" series. The camera man turns the crank of the machine, and what these celebrated little cartoon characters do, would be more difficult to tell than what they do not do. The incredulous friends of McCay are surprised and puzzled.
