One week before proposing to his girlfriend, Kyle, a down-on-his-luck romantic, discovers that she's been sleeping with another man. Unemployed, saddled with debt, and depressed, Kyle embarks on a funny yet affecting journey to recovery that involves living in his car, bottom-of-the-barrel jobs, therapy, online dating, and Kyle's own wild, fantastical, and snarky imagination.
