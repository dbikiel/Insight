Two young people in Berlin, a refugee and a homeless punk, form a relationship.
Irina, a war refugee who has to earn her money in prostitution, and Kalle, homeless punk, both live in the German capital Berlin. Their first encounter is fairly down-to-earth but soon they get feelings for each other. By joining forces, they manage to move into a small apartment. However, Irina goes further in prostitution. When one of her clients dies just after the act, the young woman is afraid to lose her happiness again.
