A young man having an existential crisis convinces a Canadian self-help guru to come to London and become his personal life coach.
At first fancying himself an "enigmatic poet", twenty something Art gradually realizes that he must take action if he's going to escape his depressed life as a struggling musician in London. A solution comes in the shape of a book titled "It's Not Your Fault". Not content to just draw inspiration from its pages, however, Art invites the elderly author of the book to come live with him and his parents, which quickly becomes a painfully funny journey about dysfunction and growing up.
A wry coming-of-age comedy about twenty-something Art (Robert Pattinson) who gets dumped by his girlfriend, moves back in with his parents and hits a quarter-life crisis. Art uses inheritance money to indulge in retail and new age therapies only to end up enlisting the help of an eccentric self-help guru, Dr. Ellington (Powell Jones). Arts painfully funny journey to define his existence brings to the fore the dysfunctional relationship he has with his parents and the importance in his life of his odd-ball friends. How To Be is a timely look at increasingly common phenomena: grown-up children living at home, frustrated creativity and self-help.
