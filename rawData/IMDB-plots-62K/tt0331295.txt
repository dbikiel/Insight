A vampire terrorizes a quiet English town.
MRS. AMWORTH is an eerie journey into a world where the present meets its long-forgotten past and where restless spirits claim the weak and unsuspecting. Mrs. Amworth, the new resident in town, is a bit different. Her neighbors might call her eccentric or light-headed. But because of her charming manner, most would forgive her sometimes bizzare behavior. Indeed, if it weren't preoccupied with the mysterious and deadly epidemic gripping it, the serene English village would welcome Mrs. Amworth with open arms. Most are utterly baffled by the isolated epidemic. Dr. Ross suspects that there must be some connection between the epidemic and the biting gnats. But Mr. Urcombe has a hunch that it is no mere coincidence that Mrs. Amworth and the disease suddenly appeared at the same time. As his private investigations continue, his gut feeling is frighteningly confirmed. He must take the dangerous steps necessary to rid the village of a sinister and haunting presence.From: http://www.vampyres-online.com/amworth.html
