Marian moves to New York to make it big in the chorus and becomes involved in a love triangle.
With time on his hands during a business trip, Jimmy Decker (who's engaged to his boss's daughter) romances small-town church organist Marion Cullen, who follows him to New York only to learn Jimmy's true colors after she's burned her bridges. Marion's looks and talent get her a job with theatrical producer Ford Humphries. Will she succumb to her boss, take up with now-married Jimmy, marry honest suitor Tony Travers...or become a full-fledged gold digger?
