One day, three men, three different settings, the all-pervading violence that envelopes Colombia their inexorable connective tissue.
A man in chains, a young man who dreams of being part of something and a militant from an armed group who must wield a cruelty in which he may not believes in. All of them in the center of a violence that they dont understand. The film, through three successive stories, gives unique faces, not interchangeable, to the tragic reality of the war. The characters, each voluntary or involuntary part of a mechanism that overcomes them, reveal their greatness or misery in the minimum tasks that they deal to survive. From that sometimes morbid- poetry of the everyday and the irrefutable truth of the details, we see a country whose social body is sick and injures. But where, however, people attempts to be happy and live dreaming and loving.
