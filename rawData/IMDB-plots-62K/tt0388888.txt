A documentary on the once-promising American rock bands The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols, and the friendship/rivalry between their respective founders, Anton Newcombe and Courtney Taylor.
A documentary on the rivalry between two rock bands. On one hand we have The Dandy Warhols, and its leader Courtney Taylor-Taylor, and on the other The Brian Jonestown Massacre, lead by Anton Newcombe. They used to be close friends but their differing lifestyles and ambitions, especially that of Anton Newcombe, have forced them apart, to the point of being enemies.
Tracks the tumultuous rise of two talented musicians, Anton Newcombe, leader of the Brian Jonestown Massacre; and Courtney Taylor, leader of the Dandy Warhols; dissecting their star-crossed friendship and bitter rivalry. Both are hell-bent on staging a self-proclaimed revolution of the music industry. Through their loves and obsessions, gigs and recordings, arrests and death threats, uppers and downers--and ultimately to their chance at a piece of the profit-driven music business--how each handles his stab at success is where the relationship frays and burns.
