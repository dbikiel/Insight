Rebellious football player Johnny falls for cheerleader Tracy. They come from opposite backgrounds; she's from a comfortable well off family, his is poor and broken. Tracy already has a boyfriend but he acts like a jerk, so Johnny has to win Tracy's heart - something she seems reluctant to let him do.
