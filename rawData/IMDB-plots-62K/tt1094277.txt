A look at the pervasive power of dust from its tiny particles settling in unseen places to its ability to cause illnesses and create the cosmos.
Dust. It is everywhere and ever-present. A conglomeration of the finest particles set in motion as soon as things are starting to settle. It is fought and cleared away and yet returns again even as it is being removed. A Sisyphus whoever tries to defeat it. Dust nestles in carpets and in attics. It invades laboratories and settles on artworks. It is blown into the air from factory smokestacks and resides in every raindrop. Dust causes illness, dust makes up the cosmos. It is the smallest, discernable subject about which to make a film.
