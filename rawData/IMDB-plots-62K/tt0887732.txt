A well-off and sophisticated couple struggles to stay together after the husband loses his job.
Manager Michele lost his job but didn't tell his wife Eve, who was completing her art history PhD. Michele ponders whether to accept quickly a less lucrative job or hope for a better one. He opts to look for a higher paying job, in an attempt to retain their upper-middle class status and lifestyle, but is disappointed time and time again. Eventually, they are forced to sell their home and rent an apartment in a working class neighborhood. Meanwhile, she is forced to take two part-time jobs, and stop her volunteer work restoring a fresco. As the reality of their new working-class status emerges, they struggle to hold onto their sense of selves and their relationship.
Elsa, a refined art history graduate, and Michele, the co-founder of a maritime company, share a prosperous life; however, things will take a turn for the worse, when Michele summons up the courage to confess that they are, in fact, indebted to the bank. As a result, Elsa is now forced to adapt to this new reality, as ever-growing debts and insurmountable problems keep adding up--while on the other hand--an utterly defeated Michele gradually falls into limbo and self-pity. But, in the end, exhausted and unsuccessful to leave the past behind, this once-inseparable couple will, inevitably, risk losing their most precious and inestimable asset: their love. Will life ever be the same again?
