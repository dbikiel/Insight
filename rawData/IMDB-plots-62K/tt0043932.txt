Steve Carson, a former Texas Ranger Captain, shoots a fleeing hold-up bandit and is framed on a murder charge. He escapes with the help of his pal Smiley and they hire out as cowhands on a ranch owned by Toni Eaton. Steve, as the Durango Kid, learns that Buck Prescott has been fleecing the local ranchers by paying low prices for their cattle that have been stampeded by his henchmen. But he has no proof and his alter ego Steve is still wanted on the murder charge.
