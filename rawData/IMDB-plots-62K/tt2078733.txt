Anne (37) has given up finding a man, who will fit in to her sensible and controlled life. She has therefore decided to get inseminated with a carefully selected sperm donor. But as her hormones get the better of her she realizes that the child may come to resemble the father and possibly get his less flattering characteristics. Anne feels compelled to find the sperm donor and ensure that he is as perfect as she imagines. She begins to stalk him and slowly but surely she gets involved in his life and finds out that he is far from her idea of a perfect man. Against all odds chemistry occurs between them and Anne has to decide between being in control of her life or letting go and see what love brings.
