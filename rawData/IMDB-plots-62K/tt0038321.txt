Sheriff Mark Rowley and his brother John find themselves in an annexed area of Indian Territory which is home to notorious outlaws like Jesse James and Sam Bass.
After some gun play with a posse, the James Gang head for Quinto in a section of land which is not a part of America. Anyone there is beyond the law so the town is populated with outlaws. Next to arrive is Sheriff Rowley, following his brother whom the Gang have brought in injured. Rowley has no authority and gets on well enough with the James boys but is soon involved in other local goings-on, including a move to vote for annexation with Oklahoma which would allow the law well and truly in.
After a clash with Captain Hampton over the arrest of his friend, "Honest Jim" Badger, Deputy Sheriff John Rowley is wounded. Frank and Jesse James rescue Badger and take John with them to the town of Quinto, in the Oklahoma Territory, for treatment. John's older brother, Mark, a Texas Sheriff, quarrels with Hampton over the shooting affair an, seizing Hampton's horse to replace his own horse which was stolen by the James gang, rides off after John, with Hampton swearing vengeance. In Quinto, Mark meets Henryette Alcott, a newspaper editor crusading to have the lawless territory given statehood. Henryette is opposed not only the outlaws who use the town and territory to escape the law, but also by the local cattlemen who prefer their present tax-free status as part of a territory and not a state of the union. Colonel Farewell, head of the cattlemen, induces Mark to become the sheriff of Quinto. Mark follows John and Badger who have gone with the Dalton gang on a raid of Coffeyville, Kansas, but is too late to keep John from being killed in the raid. He and Badger return to Quinto where Hampton, now a U.S.Marshal, traps Mark and kills Badger. Mark is handcuffed and now at the mercy of the vicious Hampton.
