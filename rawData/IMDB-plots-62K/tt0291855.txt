The heir to a village elder's family squanders his inheritance and bullies all and sundry.
Neelakandan (Mohanlal) is the heir to the Mangalasherry family who squanders away his father's largest and is a dependable menace to society. One of his victims is promising dancer Bhanu (Revathi) who vows never to dance again till his death following a public affront by Neelakandan and his cronies. Ironically they fall in love. Meanwhile, the vicious Shekaran (Napoleon) of a rival clan has sworn to avenge the death of his uncle, killed by Neelakandan's men. A reasonably watchable film that goes fairly awry towards the second half. Innocent is good as Neelakandan's long-suffering manservant.
