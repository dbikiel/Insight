"Fawns" is a polish chapter of the feature-length anthology film titled "The Fourth Dimension". The other two chapters of the movie were directed by Harmony Korine and Aleksei Fedorchenko.
Grolsch Film Works and VICE Films present 'The Fourth Dimension', a film that gives us a glimpse of enlightenment through the eyes of three one-of-a-kind characters. The three filmmakers - Fedorchenko, Korine and Kwiecinski - have created three unique stories that offer up their vision of this higher plane of existence, the Fourth Dimension. Each filmmaker takes his character on a journey that changes the way they see the world and themselves. And each filmmaker will offer a different perspective on what the Fourth Dimension is.
