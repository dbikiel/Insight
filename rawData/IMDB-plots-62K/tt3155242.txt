Alexander, a boy who has been raised in a sequestered commune, finds that his increasing unwillingness to fall in line puts him on a collision course with Gregori, the society's charismatic and domineering leader.
A tangled story about a man who, in first light, seems to save battered women and abused children - bringing them to a private enclave to live free of fear albeit in a strange communal system with only the mothers, the children and one man. As the story progresses, we see how fragile this man's ego is within some of his encounters when a child challenges him. One of his biggest challengers is a young man he saved the day he was born - which brings a nice ironic twist to the plot. I'm curious to find out if the mothers know about the daytime sorties he has them going on........The final line is prophetic
