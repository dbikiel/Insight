The background of this picture represents a scene along the beautiful river Seine in Paris. A gentleman enters, and taking a blackboard from the side of the picture, he draws on it a sketch of a novelist. Then, standing in the centre, he causes the living features of his sketch to appear in the place of his own, which is utterly devoid of whiskers. The change is made so mysteriously that the eye cannot notice it until one sees quite another person in the place of the first. Again another sketch is shown on the board, this one being that of a miser; then an English cockney; a comic character; a French policeman, and last of all, the grinning visage of Mephistopheles. It is almost impossible to give this film a more definite description; suffice it to say that it is something entirely new in motion pictures and is sure to please.
Through a rapid succession of drawings, ingenious disguises and soft dissolves, the director portrays a quick-sketch artist who alters himself and transforms to various characters according to the static outlines on his chalkboard. As the process of the illusion from a bearded old man to a happy clown, and then, a demon unfolds before our eyes, without a doubt, this artist is indeed the King of make-up.
A man stands at a chalk board and draws himself. Then, as the chalk drawing changes, the man himself goes through a series of transformations: he's bald, then he's an old bearded man, then he's mustachioed with pork-chop sideburns. The hair keeps changing as does the man's affect: aged with white hair, comic, Napoleonic, and, finally, devilish.
