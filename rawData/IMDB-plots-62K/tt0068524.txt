In the Wild West, a dead Englishman's greenhorn son joins his father's old gang and becomes a real frontier-man.
By his dying father's last wish Joe is sent to the Wild West to become a real guy. The dreamy young man despises guns and fights, likes poems and prefers bicycles to horses. Now his three teachers, footpads all of them, shall teach him otherwise. This doesn't work, until Joe has to defend himself against gunman Morton, who's jealous of Joe's love to rancher Ohlsen's beautiful daughter.
