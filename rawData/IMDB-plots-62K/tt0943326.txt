Wayward young lass Diana Kelper arrives in a small town in New Mexico looking to start a new life for herself. Alas, the sleazy Fred forces Diana to work as an exotic dancer at a strip club. Things go from bad to worse for Diana after she's abducted by ruthless psychotic predator Colin Mandel, who dumps Diana in the remote wilderness completely nude so he can hunt her down like a wild animal. Can Diana muster up the necessary strength and cunning in order to survive this harrowing ordeal?
A young woman travels to a town where hunting is a very common sport and works as a dancer. But after accepting a ride from a stranger, she awakes naked in the woods, and the hunt is on. The young woman has a series of difficulties which lead to her constantly having a lack of choices. She has no money, and seems to be lied to as a standard course. The dancing job lacks the class she suspected, and is really in a seedy club with seedy people where she is expected to dance at least semi naked. She wants to get away, but has no choices. She tries to find someone, anyone to send her money to get out of this town, but no possibilities there. New people in this odd town are suspicious and new friends that seem to be good or ethical are very hard to make. This all adds to her being quite alone and having no one to turn to. All of that also makes her very vulnerable to a killer looking for vulnerable women.
