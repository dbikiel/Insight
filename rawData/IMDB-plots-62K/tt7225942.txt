Caniba is a film that reflects on the discomforting significance of cannibalistic desire in human existence through the prism of one man, Issei Sagawa, and his mysterious relationship with his brother, Jun.
In 1981, young Issei Sagawa of Japan murdered a Dutch student in Paris and ate part of his body. Declared mentally ill, he did not face a normal trial, and after spending two years in a French clinic, he returned to Japan. There he wrote a book, published a manga about his crime and even appeared in pornography. In an attempt to unravel the dark motives that led him to cannibalism, the anthropologists and film-makers Véréna Paravel and Lucien Castaing-Taylor perform in 'Caniba', their third full-length film, an atypical and sensory portrait of Sagawa, who more than thirty-five years after the events in Paris, lives suffering a paralysis that keeps him partially immobilized.
