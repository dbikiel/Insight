Fifteen young sailors... six months of intense training... one chance at the brass ring. This documentary tells the story of a group of intrepid and determined young men and women, on the cusp of adulthood, as they embark on life's first great adventure. Racing a high-performance 52-foot sloop in the TRANSPAC, the most revered of open-ocean sailing competitions, the crew of "Morning Light" matches wits and skills in a dramatic 2300 mile showdown against top professionals. From their earliest training sessions in Hawaii conducted by world-class teachers through their test of endurance on the high seas, they form an unbreakable bond in the process of becoming a singular team that is greater than the sum of its parts.
This wonderful boat designed and captained by Roy Disney is "Pyewacket. "Pyewacket, launched in 2004, is a MaxZ86 class custom-built, carbon fiber racing yacht with a mast towering 120 feet and a revolutionary canting keel, which moves from one side of the boat to the other for greater speed.When Pyewacket was built, it was the largest boat to feature a canting keel. It remains one of only a half-dozen like it in the world, Avery said.It was named after a witch's cat in "Bell, Book and Candle.""These boats are something special -- going into that new evolutionary class," said Rich Roberts, sailing columnist for the Log, a boating and fishing newspaper. "They can sail faster than the wind in very light wind or moderate wind.... It requires a little bit more sailing skill. You can't just put a bunch of weekend sailors on this boat and expect to do much."Author's note ***I had the privilege of bringing her to a dock at the Aloha Tower Marketplace in downtown Honolulu Harbor. She was the largest of the racing sloops in the Transpac race and could not be docked at either the Hawai'i or Waikiki Yacht Clubs. So we brought her around to where they bring the big ocean liners such as the QE2 or Queen Mary II of the Canard line. She is an utterly magnificent boat!
