A polo player's wife becomes the mystery woman in a Long Island horsy-set murder trial.
Shelby Barrett (Barbara Stanwyck) rides show horses for wealthy widow "Nicko" Nicholas (Genevieve Tobin)and meets Johnny Wyatt (Gene Raymond), scion of a once-wealthy Long Island Family, but who now goes about the country riding polo ponies for "Nicko." Despite the efforts of "Nicko" and wealthy Gene Fairchild (John Eldredge), who is in love with Shelby, Johnny and Shelby are married. Shelby is treated frigidly by her snobby-but-broke in-laws, who frown even more when she and Johnny start handling the horses for wealthy neighbors on money Shelby had borrowed from Fairchild without telling her proud-but-broke husband. Matters aren't helped any when "Nicko" shows up and starts a gossip circuit directed against Shelby. When Johnny is away, Fairchild asks Shelby to help him entertain a wealthy client aboard his yacht. She tries to contact Johnny and fails but accepts the invitation. The customer shows up drunk with a likewise female companion, who manages to fall overboard and drown but Fairchild is held for murder. He intends to keep Shelby's name out of the case even though it looks bad for him. But, at the last minute, Shelby turns up in court as the missing "woman in red' witness and and saves Fairchild. The question is will Johnny understand and forgive her, although she has done nothing to be forgiven for.
Polo player Johnny Wyatt falls for Shelby Barrett, pro horse-show rider; Shelby's employer, rich widow 'Nicko' Nicholas (on whom both are financially dependent) is after Johnny. The triangle ends with elopement. Can they prosper despite sore losers, backbiting relatives, and a dangerous scandal that threatens their marriage?
