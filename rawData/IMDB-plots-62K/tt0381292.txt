Being a student in a school where the headmaster is your father and the head supervisor your mother is no bed of roses. That's what Daniel Massu tells himself every day of his life. The others believe he is his father's pet whereas the latter wants his son to sleep in the dormitory with the others, which he hates! And although Daniel claims he has swept the sexy Mercédès off her feet he is no ladies' man! To say nothing of his bad spelling, which regularly earns him appallingly low grades. But Damien, who has drive, does not let all those problems get him down.
