Set in 1984, when the war on drugs was at its height, the story concerns a strain of mold developed by the government to wipe out Colombian coca fields. Unfortunately, during a demonstration, the mold gets out of control and proves to be deadly to more than just vegetation.
It's 1984, and the war on drugs just got weird. A classified government project is underway to create a new weapon to combat the drug cartels. That weapon is a fast-growing, genetically engineered strain of mold designed to wipe out coca fields - the only problem is, this MOLD also feeds on human flesh. And when the murderous mildew is mysteriously released in a secret lab, it wages its own war on a group of unsuspecting scientists and military officials, who are forced to fight their way to safety while trying to contain the MOLD before it is unleashed on the world.
