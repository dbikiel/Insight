Vignettes of Roman life feature a jogger, robbers, newlyweds, an opportunistic mechanic and a sadistic meter-maid.
Set in modern day Rome, Bits and Pieces has been compared to Short Cuts, as it has no central characters and multiple storylines. It starts with a robbery at a restaurant. Moving to a "fence" and a journalist. Then a dental salesman whose wife is murdered by their son. A social worker who's having an affair. A man returning to Rome after living in England for many years. And so on...
Rome, yesterday. Twenty-four hours of short stories. Three young men rob a restaurant and try to sell off the stolen goods; a man has a heartache; a dentist is speaking about finance and stocks; a journalist is trying to write a good article for his editor-in-chief; four bricklayers are talking about life and work. A birthday party; a taxi-driver; two municipal guards; a strange killer kills a rich man. At the end, a man breaks into a run on a terrace and then...vanishes !
