A shy high school student's seemingly perfect relationship with a popular jock quickly turns abusive and dangerous.
Shy sixteen-year-old Stacy Collins can't believe that the most popular guy in school, an attractive athlete named Bobby Tennison, is interested in her. At first she is flattered by his constant attention, but then he becomes possessive and jealous-telling her who she can speak to and what she can wear. Threats escalate into violence when Bobby thinks Stacy has stepped out of line. Soon she is walking on egg shells and living in fear. Having seen the tell-tale bruises, Stacy's best friend convinces her to break things off with Bobby-but in a moment of weakness, Stacy goes to meet him.
High school student 16-year-old Stacy Collins has never been in a relationship, as she has always been shy and never felt like part of the crowd. So when she hears that Bobby, a popular student and athlete, is interested in her, she immediately decides to go for it. But not soon after, Bobby starts to get jealous and manipulates her, constantly telling her what she can and cannot do. Things eventually escalate even further when Bobby would get physically violent with Stacy if she did anything that he didn't approve. With constant fighting, yelling, misunderstandings, and bruises, it is not long before Stacy's mother and friends suspect that something is wrong and start to worry that her life may be in danger. Despite the situation and constant pleas from others, Stacy would not let Bobby go and would take his side, refusing to end the relationship and telling everyone that everything is okay. Eventually, she comes to her senses and decides to break things off. But, at the last minute, she makes one last decision. However, her decision would lead to a deadly consequence.
