Jim Slater seeks a survivor of the Apache ambush his father died in.
Jim Slater's father (whom he never knew) died in the Apache ambush at Gila Valley, and Jim is searching for the one survivor, who supposedly went for help but disappeared with a lot of gold. In the process, he gets several people gunning for him, and he keeps meeting liberated woman Karyl Orton, who may be on a similar mission. Renewed Apache hostilities and an impending range war provide complications.
Aching to unravel the mystery behind his unknown father's death in the remote, post-Civil-War Gila Valley, Arizona, Jim Slater follows the trail of five men who were slaughtered in an Indian massacre. Supposedly, there was a sixth man who survived, and ran off with $60,000 in gold; however, no one knows who is this man or his whereabouts. In the meantime--as Jim crosses paths with the fearless, Karyl Orton, who has strong reasons to believe that her missing husband may have been one of the dead--the blood-thirsty Welker brothers seek retribution. In the end, did the dead take Gila Valley's secret to their grave?
