Filmed in a single continuous shot, the comedy follows a group of uptight philosophy graduate students as they cut loose at a house party on their last night together.
The Last Hurrah is a comedy filmed in a single continuous shot. Set at a graduation party in Los Angeles, an eclectic group of brainy philosophy students, train-hopping hippies, aspiring prophets, and drug-addled hipsters come together for one wild night. At the eye of the storm are three best friends, all with the same problem - women. Jason can't get enough of them, Steve can't let go of the one he's got, and Will can't understand them at all. The brainy grad students will have to work through their issues fast, because tonight's house party is their last crack at the women of the philosophy department.
