An eccentric scientist helps a fugitive from the law become invisible, unwittingly giving him the power to exact revenge on his former friends.
An eager scientist tests his new formula for invisibility on an escaped fugitive. When the formula works the criminal runs off to terrorize a family he believes cheated him out of a fortune years earlier.
Robert Griffin is an escapee from the psychopathic ward and a fugitive from the law. He also has a score to settle with his old friends, Sir Jasper and Lady Irene. He wants their daughter, Julie, and he wants half their wealth. They owe him that much. Griffin's flight through the English countryside puts him in the path of a Cockney drunk of dubious ethics and, more fatefully, with an eccentric scientist, who has discovered a great secret: how to turn a living being invisible. The scientist is eager to test his invisibility serum on a man. And Griffin is eager to become invisible and thus elude the authorities and exact his revenge. The only one who can stop him is Julie's fianc√©, Mark Foster, a handsome young reporter who slowly begins to believe wild tales about a "headless corpse."
