In Britain after the end of WWII, it is a time of general euphoria at having won the war, with full employment and general happiness for all (or nearly all). Peter, the young wastrel son of a hard working hotel owner doesn't like the idea of having to work for a living. He discovers a society of "White Elephants" who are quite willing to be poor as long as they don't have to work. They are protected and guided by Nina and her precocious sister Heidi.
Peter, former war hero son of a hard-working hotel owner, leads an idle life to his father's despair. He bumps into a society where he meets kindred spirits, lead by Nina, a Russian emigr√©. It seems he has just found his place in life.
