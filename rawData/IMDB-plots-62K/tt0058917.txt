When Quantrill's (Quantrell) gang is almost destroyed two of the captured members agree to join the Arizona Rangers to help finish the job.
Murphy plays an ex-Quantrill's (Quantrell) Raider who's released from jail with buddy Cooper to be deputized as Arizona Rangers in order to hunt down the remnant of the gang, rumored to he hiding out in a town "neer dee border" in the words of the loose-lipped saloon dancer. The goons are found hiding in an Indian mission. Murphy and Cooper pretend to want to rejoin the gang, but the bad guys catch on and brutally beat Cooper, who protects Murphy's true sentiments to the death.
