After losing his job, a journalist reluctantly agrees to help his oddball friend with his bid to earn a seat on the Seattle City Council.
There's no family dog strapped to the roof of his car, but political candidate Grant Cogswell has his own set of image problems, starting with the fact that he likes to dress up as a polar bear and he's currently an unemployed music critic. In Stephen Gyllenhaal's bittersweet, uplifting comedy GRASSROOTS - based on the true story of the 2001 Seattle City Council election - Cogswell becomes a mono-maniacal man of the people, rallying an unlikely posse of misfits, slackers, and square pegs to his seemingly hopeless David-and-Goliath battle against a firmly entrenched incumbent.Before the Occupy Movement there was Grant's fervent pitch to the Emerald City's downtrodden hipsters and idealists - to stand up for what they believe in, to take back their city government, to build a beautiful monorail that would carry them into the future, to be part of something bigger than themselves. GRASSROOTS offers an exhilarating, hilarious, bumpy ride on the political train just when we need it most, because at bottom what drives this eccentric optimist is his belief that what he is doing actually matters.Based on the book "Zioncheck for President," written by Grant Cogswell's reluctant campaign manager Phil Campbell, GRASSROOTS stars Jason Biggs as Phil and Joel David Moore as Grant. Seattle plays itself, and the city has never looked dreamier, more beautiful, or more ripe for revolt. With Lauren Ambrose, Cedric the Entertainer, Cobie Smulders, Tom Arnold, Christopher McDonald, DC Pierson, Emily Bergl.GRASSROOTS is distributed by Samuel Goldwyn Films.
