Sierra Young is a rising ing√©nue, making $10 million per picture. She's also a spoiled brat, partying all night, complaining on the set, unable to perform well. After a tantrum, in which she gets two black eyes, the director has her sent to a rehab clinic in a remote Utah town. Within a day, she's run away and is taken in by Nettie, who runs a bed and breakfast inn. Sierra also meets Nettie's grandson, Tyler, head of the local community theater. Sierra invents a name, tells Nettie a wild story, and reads for a part in Tyler's production of "Taming of the Shrew." Meanwhile, her entourage hires a private eye to find her. In a small town of real people, will she find herself first?
