Bigfoot kidnaps some women and some bikers decide to go on a rescue mission to save them.
A colony of Bigfoot creatures has kidnapped some bikini-clad babes with whom they intend to breed. A biker gang tries to resuce the girls (whom the dextrous creatures have somehow tied to stakes), while a pair of traveling salesmen (John Carradine and John Mitchum) hope to strike it rich by capturing one of the creatures.
