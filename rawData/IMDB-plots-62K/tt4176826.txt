Adolf Hitler wakes up in the 21st century. He quickly gains media attention, but while Germany finds him hilarious and charming, Hitler makes some serious observations about society.
Adolf Hitler wakes up in Berlin...in 2014. After getting his bearings he is discovered by an unemployed TV producer, Fabian Sawatzki. Sawatzki thinks Hitler is some sort of performance artist and takes him around the country, talking to the general population, for a TV piece he has envisaged. Hitler, however, sees this as a chance to regain his popularity and power.
In a puff of smoke, Adolf Hitler resurfaces, inexplicably, in present-day Berlin, disoriented and dressed in full regalia. Unable to locate his bunker, Nazi Germany's notorious leader meanders through the once-familiar city's now completely unknown streets, mingling with a motley crew of strangers who, incomprehensibly, show a brazen and blatant disrespect to his authority. However, when the recently fired freelance TV producer, Fabian Sawatzki, discovers who seems to be FÃ¼hrer's perfect impersonator, a stellar career in the station's live satirical show will pave the way for Adolf Hitler's second rise to power. Now, once more, Germany is taken by surprise. Is history repeating itself?
