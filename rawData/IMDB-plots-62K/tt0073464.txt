Two mercenaries are hired to commit a political assassination.
Tough, no-nonsense Jason Cootes and the equally rugged and more cold-blooded Darmody are a couple of mercenaries hired to assassinate two guerrilla leaders on the war-torn island of Guam. Cunning and ruthless villain, the formidable Colonel Oong, proves to be more than a match for them. Another player in this brutal game is the lovely but deadly girl, Kalin.
