Crucial events in the lives of many people occur on the same night in the same place.
At a small, struggling motor court in the Mojave Desert, events in the lives of many people climax on the same night. The family running the roadside cafe/motel is there escaping from a scandal back home. But it catches up with them. Coincidentally, a woman working there is confronted by her past also, which is connected to the scandal. And two other people who arrive separately are also involved with each other and get caught up in the action. Everything comes together in the final act as the cast of characters resolve their problems and past errors.
