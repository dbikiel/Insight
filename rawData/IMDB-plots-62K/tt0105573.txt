Willis Embry is a jail psychologist whose girlfriend has left him. He has no time to be sad because a very ill old man tells him about a robbery and the millions of dollars hidden somewhere. The old man asks Willis to find it and give a part of it to his relative, and he can keep the rest. The bad guy next door has heard the whole thing.
