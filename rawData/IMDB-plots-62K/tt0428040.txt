Live in Chicago documents two nights of a show the group did in Chicago in support of their album Quebec. The DVD features a wide variety of Ween songs, covering nearly every Ween album and even features a cover of the Led Zeppelin classic "All of My Love". Also, the DVD contains alternate camera angles for three of the performances, and a bonus music video for the song "Transdermal Celebration."
