Almost as soon as Jake and Cassie decide to get married on Christmas Eve, complications arise. Ex-con Leon Deeks arrives in town, and Jake is asked by the mayor to make him his top priority. At the same time, Jake's having trouble securing the wedding license since he can't find Cassie's documents proving her existence. There's also the difficulty in finding a wedding cake at the last minute. Last but not least, Jake's kids are upset: Brandon wants to spend time with his new girlfriend, and is feuding with his sister Lori. Meanwhile, Lori manages to lose Cassie's wedding ring.
Jake hopes to break Brandion's seasonal gloom since his wife died on Christmas Eve by finally wedding Cassie then. The kids' initial joyful acclaim dampens as Brandon is furious at sister Lori for bluntly suspecting his girlfriend of stealing Cassie's heirloom wedding ring from the shop. Mayor Tom Tinsdale lost his shirt in the real estate crisis, so his haughty big spender wife Martha hopes to launch a career as party planner with Jake's wedding, but ignores the couple's more modest taste. Deputy Derek Sanders falls in love with the caterer despite being assigned to watch ex-con Leon Deeks, who is suspected of retrieving his bank robbery loot or worse, but accepts a charity Santa job and desperately hopes to reunite his family despite being divorced is jail. Failing obsolete, grandfather George considers moving to Montr√©al, but the manor offers an alternative.
It is about a witch ( good ) called Chritie and she has her own shop.
