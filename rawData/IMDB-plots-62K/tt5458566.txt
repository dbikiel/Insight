Two Danish BFFs have lost interest in their wives and consider divorce, but end up getting drunk and hiring a Russian hitman online instead. The Russian flies in. Unfortunately, their wives get to know the Russian as well.
Two tradesmen, Ib and Edward, are tired of their lifeless marriages and dream of living the good life from the stash of money they've earned moonlighting over the years. After a huge fight with their wives the two men get drunk and hire a Russian contract killer to do a hit on their spouses. But they have badly underestimated their wives, and this becomes the start of an absurd journey where, to their own horror, Ib and Edward end at the top of a kill list.
