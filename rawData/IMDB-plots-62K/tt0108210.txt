During WW2, after the 'ingenious' desertion of the German guards, the Allied prisoners of a POW camp decide to remain in the camp, some masquerading as German guards, in order to fool the frequent SS inspections.
During World War II, some Commonwealth prisoners are trying to escape from a German prison camp. Because they are old and weak, the Germans decide to escape with them. Just after the Germans are outside, the prisoners take control of the camp. Some will act as prisoners, some as Germans.
