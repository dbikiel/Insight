A Texas Ranger must capture an outlaw and take him-in, while tangling with savage Apaches and greedy bounty-hunters on the way back to jail.
Audie Murphy is again the kid who puts on a badge to catch the bad guy, skillfully played by Barry Sullivan. On the way back to town the two develop a curiously close relationship - Sullivan passes up several chances to get away - but in the end Sullivan "asks for it" and Murphy obliges.
"Seven Ways from Sundown" Jones, whose father numbered the kids and the mother embellished the numbers, joins the Texas Rangers, and his first assignment is to accompany ranger-veteran Hennessey on a mission to capture Jim Flood, a notorious outlaw who eluded the law for years. Capturing him, in New Mexico, is not near the job that getting him back to a Texas jail turns out to be.
