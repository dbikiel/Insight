Thiago lives with his family on an isolated farm in the arid backlands of Minas Gerais, Brazil. As the story unfolds and Thiago is forced to confront separations and betrayal within the home, Thiago begins, little by little, to see and understand a place that he had never been able to before, thus slowly letting go of his innocence.
In the rural countryside of Brazil, the boy Thiago lives in a simple house in an isolated area with his brutal but hardworking father; his submissive mother; his comrade uncle; his grandmother and his four siblings. He witnesses an intense quarrel between his parents when his father accuses his mother of betrayal. Later his grandmother throws his uncle from the home. When his brother Felipe hurts his foot, he gets sick without medication and dies. Then his uncle tells him that his father has killed a neighbor.
