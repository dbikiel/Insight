James J. Corbett and Peter Courtney meet in a boxing exhibition.
James J. Corbett and Peter Courtney meet in a boxing exhibition, with special conditions that will allow the Thomas Edison Company to film the match and show it on their Kinetograph. The match consists of six one-minute rounds. The popular James J. Corbett had earlier defeated the great John L. Sullivan and must be considered a heavy favourite. But, at least for a while, Peter Courtney seems to be holding his own.
