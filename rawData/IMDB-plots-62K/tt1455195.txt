Lightheaded is a journey we take with temperature sensitive candle creatures who sacrifice what they know to become who they are.
An explosive comet crashes to the surface of a candle planet igniting a rhythmic flame. The ground gives birth to emerging wax creatures that instinctively begin a tribal dance. They circle the flame until a second comet draws them from there home, leading them on a sacrificial journey.
