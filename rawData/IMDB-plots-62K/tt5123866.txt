After suffering the loss of his best friend Charlie on Christmas Eve, sixteen year old Bobby Whiteside ventures out onto the lake where they played countless games of winter hockey. Upon shoveling the ice surface he makes a shocking discovery --- a magic, perfectly groomed hockey rink that appears only at night and only in his presence. When a local construction company purchases the land for development, Bobby must join forces with his high school crush, rally the town, and play one last game on the night pond --- with an old friend.
