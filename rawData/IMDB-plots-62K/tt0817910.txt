Hellboy (Ron Perlman) and his team face off against a new supernatural threat, while Professor Bruttenholm (Sir John Hurt) must investigate the possible reemergence of a vampire he had slain decades prior.
In 1939, young Professor Bruttenholm destroyed Erzsebet Ondrushko (Kath Soucie), a female vampire who bathed in the blood of innocents to stay young. Now someone in upstate New York is trying to bring her back, and the elderly Professor Broom (Sir John Hurt) has decided to investigate it himself. He takes the top B.P.R.D. Agents, Hellboy (Ron Perlman), Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), and Abe Sapien (Doug Jones), who are more worried about his welfare than the return of any vampire. Their tune changes when they face a horde of ghosts, a phantom wolf pack, witches, harpies, a giant werewolf and Erzsebet. Hellboy ends up battling the Queen of Witches, the goddess Hecate (Cree Summer), who wants him to embrace his true destiny, a destiny that includes the destruction of mankind.
