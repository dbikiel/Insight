An up-and-coming journalist finds his world and faith increasingly challenged when he's granted the interview of a lifetime - with someone who claims to be God.
Paul Asher, an up-and-coming journalist, returns home from covering the war in Afghanistan and finds his life is falling apart - his marriage is failing and he's in the grips of a personal crisis he doesn't yet understand. Even more pressing, a soldier that Paul befriended in Afghanistan is struggling at home and Paul is desperately trying to help him. But, Paul's life takes a strange twist when he's offered an interview that he finds impossible to resist - an interview with someone who claims to be God.
