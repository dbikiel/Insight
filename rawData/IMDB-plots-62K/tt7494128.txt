Filmed in one of the last remaining patches of old growth forest in Lithuania, The Ancient Woods is a place where the boundaries of time melt and everything that exists does not wither or age but "grows into" eternity. A poetic and atypical nature film takes its viewers on the endless journey - from the forest thickets to the wolves' caves and up to black stork's nest, and then deep into the water to the underwater forest, returning after to the human beings inhabiting the edge of the woodland. There's no commentary, only the rich, almost palpable sounds of the forest and the magical situations captured by the camera.
