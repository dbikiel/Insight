Travis, Arliss, and Lisbeth are captured by Apaches while Old Yeller's son, Sam, tracks their trail.
In this sequel to 'Old Yeller', Savage Sam is Old Yeller's son. He is a Bluetick Coonhound, and every bit as courageous and loyal as his father, as well as an incredibly keen tracker. Sam mostly likes chasing a bobcat, sometimes with Arliss.The boy's uncle, Beck (Brian Keith) (referred to as the younger brother of Jim Coates) comes by to check on how the boys are doing and gives advice to Travis (Tommy Kirk) on how to handle Arliss a little better. ("All little brothers hate bossin'. You've got to learn how to outfigger him, Travis.")Travis, Arliss, and their neighbor's granddaughter, Lisbeth Searcy (Marta Kristen) are taken captive by Apaches stealing horses. Travis is left behind when the Apaches are chased by a cavalry patrol and is found by Sam (thanks to Sam's keen sense of smell).Uncle Beck gathers up a search party including Lisbeth's somewhat overbearing grandfather, Bud Searcy (once again played by Jeff York), and neighbor Wiley Crup (Slim Pickens). Led by Sam, who tracks the Apaches despite an injured paw and a hail storm, the search party finds and rescues Arliss and Lisbeth.
