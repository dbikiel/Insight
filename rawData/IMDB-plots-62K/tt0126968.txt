Truck driver travelling along the Transamazonic Road, a huge highway in Brazil that crosses the Amazon forest, meets a prostitute and slowly becomes aware of the problems in that region.
In the 70's, the fifteen years old whore Iracema meets the truck driver Sebastião, a.k.a. "Tião Brazil Grande", and travels with him along the Amazon Forest through Transamazônica, the longest Brazilian highway recently built by the military government to bring development to the area settling landless peasants. When Tião drops her on the road, Iracema is submitted to the most decadent types of prostitution to survive.
