Hannibal is back with his new hour-long stand-up special, "Hannibal Buress: Live From Chicago," taped at the Vic Theatre in his hometown of Chicago, IL. Buress' latest offering features more of the signature dry wit and cool delivery we've come to love. This time around, the Comedy Central favorite rolls out new material about his own second line parade in New Orleans, fistfights in London, and many memorable late nights on the road. This extended and uncensored special is one not to be missed.
