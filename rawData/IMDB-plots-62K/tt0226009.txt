A popular high-school senior boy is accused of the statutory rape of a high-school sophomore girl.
Adam (Kevin Mundy) is a senior at Gatlin High. His girlfriend Amber (Reagan Pasternak) is "saving herself for marriage." In the meantime he gets acquainted with Gynger (Alycia Purrott) and gets her pregnant. The local prosecutor Lydia Stone (Mo Gaffney) is running for mayor and decides to charge Adam with statutory rape to get the "moral majority" vote.
