When a professional wingman falls for a professional man-eater, it's only a matter of time before they realize that they're in love with the competition.
After an unexpected break-up, Bobby's friends convince him to get out of his rut by leveraging his prowess with the ladies into a business as a wingman-for-hire. Meanwhile, Kristy - who's also just gone through a break-up - finds therapy and monetary success in defending women from sleazy male advances. When Kristy and Bobby take a sudden interest in each other, it's only a matter of time before one of them finds out that they're working for the competition.
