When Marc and Emma move into their new house, they have no idea that in the 1970s, their basement was a gay nightclub which had been destroyed by fire and that the house itself is now haunted by the ghosts of five gay and mischievous clubbers. And now their penchant for raising the roof with renditions of Boney M's 'Rasputin' causes havoc in the household! How to put an end to these fiendish frighteners? Is there something Mark himself can do? If so, at what cost? 'Poltergay' will have your sides in stitches and your head rolling on the floor!
The foreman Marc Modena and his beloved girlfriend Emma buy an old house expecting to raise a family of their own. Soon Marc sees five gay clubbers partying all the nights in the basement and disturbing him with the loud music. However Emma does not see the men and believes Marc is getting crazy; then she leaves him. Marc researches the Internet and finds that the basement of his house was a gay nightclub. In 1979, it has blown-up and five bodies have not been found. Marc also contacts a medium that explains that only straight people are able to see the ghosts that are trapped in the house. Meanwhile Marc befriends the gay ghosts and they decide to help him to get Emma back.
