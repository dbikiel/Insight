A documentary about young women who have been drawn into the sex trade - and how easy it is for a web-savvy generation to end up making porn.
The documentary 'Hot Girls Wanted' was an original Netflix production released in 2015. HGW follows the emerging (emerged) use of young, inexperienced girls for the on-line porn industry. It chronicles the large number of girls from all over the U. S. who are drawn to and enter the Adult Internet world. The girls leave home because they are promised fame and fortune. Also the on-line porn industry is much more exciting than both the life they experienced while growing up and the future in the small (and sometimes large) towns where they grew up. Because they are not professional models, the 'talent agent' handling them promotes them as the Girl-Next-Door. This documentary functions as soft-core porn and acts in 3 ways: 1.) provides a shallow introduction to the industry, 2.) sounds a warning signal for girls about the downside of the industry, and 3.) acts as a roadmap for young girls to enter the industry.
