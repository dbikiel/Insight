In a quiet Texas town, Candy Morrison and her husband, Dale, seem to live an ordinary life -- but that all changes when she begins sleeping with her husband's friend Stan Blankenship. When Stan's wife winds up dead -- the victim of a brutal ax murder -- Candy's arrest leaves the community in disbelief. And, as her attorney Ed Reivers attempts to prove her innocence, he makes a shocking discovery about his client.
A small town is shocked by the brutal ax murder of a woman. However, they are even more shocked when a reserved neighboring woman who is a wife and mother becomes the chief suspect.
