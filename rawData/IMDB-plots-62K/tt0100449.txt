Three thieves successfully rob a New York City bank, but making the escape from the city proves to be almost impossible.
When a man dressed as a clown enters a bank and tries to rob it, no one takes him seriously at start. But as this New Yorker pulls this daring robbery with the help of his friends, it looks like leaving the bank with all the stolen money is the easy part! All they have to do now is make it out of the city and to the airport. They have plenty of time, but its not that easy as they seem to get out of one problem only to fall into another. Will they make before the cops catch up with them?
Grimm, a burnt-out New Yorker, has devised an ingenious plan to escape the city he hates so much; dressed as a clown, he robs a Manhattan bank and cleverly escapes disguised as a hostage along with his accomplices, girlfriend Phyllis and best friend Loomis. However, whilst robbing the bank was comparatively straight-forward and easy, the getaway quickly turns into a nightmare, as the relatively simple act of getting to the airport to catch a flight becomes a tangled ordeal of obstructions, including confused roadworkers, conmen, mobsters, bureaucratic bus-drivers and a cabbie who doesn't speak a word of English. And all the while Rotzinger, the equally world-weary but relentless Chief of Police, is doggedly on their tail.
