Tarzan secretly arrives in Blue Valley, the land of the magical fountain of youth, to find the intrepid aviatrix who can save an innocent man. But, is she the same person she used to be? Can Tarzan protect the vale's ultimate mystery?
An aviatrix emerges from the jungle looking as young as she was when her plane went down many years before. Unscrupulous hunters discover that this is due to a secret fountain of youth. Tarzan tries to keep the hunters from finding the hidden valley setting of the fountain. The flyer ages as the effects of the fountain wear off.
In the prime of her life, the intrepid aviatrix, Gloria James Jessup, crash-lands in the wild jungle, leaving behind a wrecked aeroplane and her personal diary. Nearly two decades later, Tarzan finds out that an innocent man faces conviction for the aviator's death, and, secretly, follows the hidden path to the wondrous and fragile Blue Valley--the land of the magical fountain of youth--intent on bringing Gloria back to testify. However, is she the same person she used to be? And, above all, can Tarzan protect the vale's ultimate mystery from the unscrupulous opportunists who would like to exploit it?
