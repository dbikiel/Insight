A murder investigation in her hometown triggers deep-seated emotions in an Ohio police chief who came from the Amish community.
Sixteen years ago, a series of brutal murders shattered the peaceful farming community of Painters Mill, Ohio. A young Amish girl, Katie Burkholder, survived the terror of the Slaughterhouse Murders. In the aftermath of the killings, the town was left with a sense of fragility, a loss of innocence, and for Katie, the realization that she no longer belonged with the Amish. Now, a wealth of experience later, Kate Burkholder is back. Her Amish roots and big city law enforcement background make her the perfect candidate for Chief of Police. She's certain she's come to terms with her past--until the first body is discovered in a snowy field. Kate vows to stop the killer before he strikes again. But to name him, she would betray both her family and her Amish past and expose a dark secret that could destroy her.
Painters Mill, an Ohio Amish village, has been the hunting ground of the 'Slaughterhouse' serial killer. Years later, his mark, another Roman numeral, suggests his return or a copycat. The case left John Tomasetti shell-shocked, so he only acts as informal advisor -and lover- of the new chief of police, local Amish girl Katie Burkholder, who was shunned for choosing 'English' life to learn detective work in Cleveland. After Mayor Auggie Brock's niece Amanda becomes the next victim, he suspends Katie and hands the case to senior deputy Nathan Detrick. While the informally still collaborating cop trio ponders if the Original killer returned, revelations from the past shock the Amish community, including Katie's abandoned lover and her own family, but the police staff has its own dark secret.
