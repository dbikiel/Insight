1985. Georges is a born market vendor. As a driven salesman he can sell anything to any one, at any time. When he hears the Pope is coming to Belgium, he spots an opportunity. In close proximity to the grounds where tens of thousands of believers will attend an open-air mass, Café Derby is for rent. Georges is convinced he'll earn a small fortune. His wife and five children however, are not convinced, as it would mean moving again in very short notice. But they'll soon find out that when George puts his mind to something, there's no stopping him. Café Derby tells the tragicomic story of a cheerful but slightly dysfunctional family, inspired by true events. Café Derby is the first feature film by Lenny Van Wesemael, a production of Menuet.
