Story of the world-renowned trumpet player.
In this movie based on a true story, Arturo Sandoval is a phenomenal trumpet player, but he faces a major obstacle in pursuing his art: Jazz is illegal in his homeland, Cuba, where only state-sanctioned music can be played. Yearning to escape the repression and censorship of the Castro regime, Sandoval knows the only way he will be able to fulfill his passion will be to flee to the United States. However, he has fallen in love with Marianela, a dedicated communist.
