An atomic research experiment goes awry in St. Louis, Missouri unleashing not only a big black hole, but also a creature from beyond that feeds on electricity through the streets of this Midwest city.
In St. Louis, the scientists Dr. William Hauser, Shannon Muir and Kent accidentally create a black hole during an experiment. While investigating the phenomenon, Dr. Hauser and Kent die and the army comes to their laboratory under the command of General Ryker. Shannon tries to call the prominent Dr. Eric Bryce, but the scientist does not answer the phone since he misses his daughter Kayley after the divorce to his ex-wife Elizabeth. When he is contacted, he comes to the laboratory and soon he finds that the experiment has also unleashed a creature that feeds off energy. The Powers That Be wants a nuclear attack against the creature, but Eric warns that the action will increase the black hole. He also believes that the creature may be destroyed and the black hole closed if they are attracted to each other. However, only General Ryker supports his theory while General Tate wants to bomb the location.
It's 2 A.M. in St. Louis when a routine scientific experiment goes terribly wrong and an explosion shakes the city. A scientific team investigates, clashing with an intergalactic, voltage-devouring creature that vaporizes them. By 7 A.M. a chain of earthquakes is tearing the city apart while a massive swirling black hole is consuming the remains. The alien is devouring every source of electricity it finds and destroying every human who blocks its way. Mass chaos rules as St. Louis is being evacuated. Only a few people, scientist Eric Bryce, his assistant Shannon, and General Ryker comprehend the mortal danger. By midnight, the Pentagon initiates a nuclear attack against the black hole. Bryce has only one hour to find a solution to obliterate the alien and the colossal black hole before mankind is annihilated.
