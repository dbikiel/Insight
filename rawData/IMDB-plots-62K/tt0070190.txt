Jason, a member of a 1960's pop group, decides he needs a break at a country retreat. On the train he meets Judy, niece of Aunt Harris who owns the place with her husband Dr Storm and who are using the guests for surgical mind-control experiments. So while Jason and Judy are pretty quickly making out, they are just as quickly working out how to get away.
Dr.Storm plans to take over the world, but first needs to test his 'guinea pig' theory out on some unsuspecting humans who arrive at the 'Horror Hospital' thinking they are going to have a great time, due to the advert in the paper, 'Hairy Holidays'. When Jason and Janet arrive, they are suspicious from the start and try to escape, but Dr.Storm (Michael Gough) has other ideas!!!
A young singer from a very seventies band decides he needs a vacation, so he travels to a creepy mansion in the heart of rural England to have all his inhibitions removed. He meets up with a sweet innocent girl who is travelling there to meet her aunt, who turns out to be a nasty matron type person. Eventually, they arrive to discover nearly all the other hospital inhabitants to be under some kind of mind control, with big scars on their heads. Not being in the slightest bit disturbed by this, they proceed to have lots of sex. Other guests, meanwhile realise something is amiss, and try to escape only to be decapitated by some kind of killer car, or to be beaten to death by mad motorcyclists. Eventually realising something is up, our hero and heroine have a big fight scene with the bikers, two at a time, and escape in the villains car.
