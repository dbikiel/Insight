The decisive years of Swedish footballer Zlatan Ibrahimovic, told through rare archival footage where a young Zlatan speaks openly about his life and challenges. The film closely follows Zlatan, from his debut in Malmö FF in 1999, through his conflictual years with Ajax Amsterdam, up to the final breakthrough with Juventus in 2005. BECOMING ZLATAN is a coming-of-age film, depicting the complicated journey of this young, talented and troubled player who finally becomes a superstar in the international football world. It's a story about a young talent living under constant pressure. From the teammates in Malmö who think he's too egoistic and only plays for himself. From the tough managers of Ajax who send him to the bench, where he loses his self-confidence. From his father who tells the 18 year old Zlatan: You're nothing. You're nothing special until you've succeeded internationally. Throughout his journey, Zlatan stays true to himself. When he finally succeeds in Italy he also closes the doors to his personal life. Football superstar Zlatan Ibrahimovic is an enigma, but in this story from his breakthrough years, he - for a moment - gives some glimpses into who he really is.
