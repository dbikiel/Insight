In a world of vampires, an expert vampire hunter and his young protégé travel toward sanctuary.
Martin was a normal teenage boy before the country collapsed in an empty pit of economic and political disaster. A vampire epidemic has swept across what is left of the nation's abandoned towns and cities, and it's up to Mister, a death dealing, rogue vampire hunter, to get Martin safely north to Canada, the continent's New Eden.
In a near future, the North America is an anarchic country after a vampire apocalypse. The teenager Martin is preparing to travel with his parents when they are attacked by a vampire. Martin is rescued by the stranger Mister and after killing the vampire, they head to the north expecting to reach the New Eden, former Canada. Along their journey through the destroyed country, Mister trains Martin and they rescue and befriend other survivors and have to fight not only against the vampires, but also a dangerous brotherhood of fanatic religious members led by the insane Jebedia Loven.
