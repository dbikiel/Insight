Mobster Paul Vitti is released into Dr. Ben Sobol's care, where only more chaos ensues.
The mafia's Paul Vitti is back in prison and will need some serious counseling when he gets out. Naturally, he returns to his analyst Dr. Ben Sobel for help and finds that Sobel needs some serious help himself as he has inherited the family practice, as well as an excess stock of stress.
Feigning mental deficiency to get out of the impenetrable Sing Sing prison, the unrepentant mob boss, Paul Vitti, is now released into the custody of his favourite psychiatrist, Dr Ben Sobel. Still having unresolved issues to deal with, the good doctor reluctantly accepts to pick up where they left off after his idiosyncratic relationship with Paul in Analyze This (1999), forced to make his conflicted patient a proper model citizen. Once more, there is yet another pressing deadline, so that the dangerous don is ready before his parole hearing. Indeed, this is one of the most difficult cases in Dr Sobel's entire career. Can he analyse that?
