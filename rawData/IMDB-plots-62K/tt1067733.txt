A Swedish gay couple adopt what they think is an 18-month-old orphan, only to meet their new son, a 15-year-old homophobic delinquent.
Goran and Sven have been cleared for adoption and are given the option to adopt Swedish orphan "Patrik 1,5," but when Patrik arrives, he turns out not to be the little boy they were expecting. A comma was misplaced, and the boy they receive is a 15-year-old homophobe with a criminal past.
In a suburb in Sweden, gay Dr. Göran and his partner, executive Sven, receive a letter informing them that they can finally adopt an orphan - Patrik 1,5. With the understanding that Patrik is a one-and-half-year-old baby, they prepare a room for him; however, there is a typo. Patrick is actually a fifteen-year-old homophobic teenager with a criminal record. The gay couple assumes there is a mix-up, but it's Friday afternoon and they need to wait until Tuesday to contact the Social Service. Over the weekend, Sven has friction with the adolescent (thinking he'll be stabbed in his sleep while the lad fears he'll be raped), but Göran befriends Patrik and discovers he's an experienced gardener. Göran and Sven have an argument about Patrik and Sven leaves Göran. When Göran learns that Patrik has been rejected by families for ten years, he decides to adopt him, but now that he is alone, his initial process of adoption is no longer valid and he needs to prepare a new application.
Göran and Sven have been cleared for adoption. The problem is that no giving countries approve of homosexual parents. But one day theres an opening, and they have a possibility to adopt a Swedish orphan, Patrik 1,5. But when Patrik arrives he turns out to be someone else, not the little boy they were expecting. A comma had been misplaced in the red-tape, and in comes a 15-year-old homophobe with a criminal past.
