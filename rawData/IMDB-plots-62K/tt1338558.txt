Two High School guys assist their friend, Bob Zula, In obtaining his much needed closure from his newly ex-girlfriend Jamie. Bob quickly makes the transition from a passive, timid young man, and enters an immediate state of regression from the "answers" Jamie gives him. Did I mention that this all takes place in the front yard of Jamie's house?
