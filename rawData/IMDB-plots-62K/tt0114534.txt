The setting is early America during the oil boom. An elderly, down on his luck "oil man", Mr. Cox (Robert Duvall), finds himself in the town of Henrietta. Using unconventional methods, he convinces himself and local Don Day (Aidan Quinn) that there is oil on Day's land. The financially strapped Day puts everything into finding oil, but at what cost?
