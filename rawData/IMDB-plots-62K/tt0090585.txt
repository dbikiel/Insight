London 1958. It's the early era of rock and roll, where teenagers in particular are experiencing a sense of freedom of expression not afforded teenagers of the war and immediate post-war periods. Nineteen year old Colin is trying to find his place in life. He truly believes in equality for all, regardless of race, color, creed, sex or sexual orientation. He has nothing against money in and of itself, but doesn't like what one generally has to do to obtain money, or what money does to people. He loves Crepe Suzette. She in turn loves him, but is focusing on her career as an aspiring fashion designer instead of him. That focus is highlighted by her actions following a fashion show for her generally conservative boss, Henley of Mayfair. Colin drops his principles to do work for money to impress Suzette, that work as a photographer. Through this process of finding himself, Colin finds that he ends up being the public spirit of the London teenager. But that work takes him further and further from his own ideals, from which he may not be able to escape to find his way back to his true self and to Suzette.
