A young man takes drastic measures to rid his dysfunctional family of its various afflictions.
Alessandro, a young epileptic with paranoid inclinations, decides to relieve Augusto, the only sound brother, from the burden of a numerous family plagued with hereditary diseases. After a first aborted attempt, the dreadful series of accidents/murders is started by pushing the blind mother into a ravine. Then comes the turn of Leone, the idiotic brother. Will Alessandro be able to bring to completion his obsessive project ?
Claustrophobia within a family. On a rural estate live three brothers, a sister, and their blind, religious mother. Three of the siblings have epilepsy, the fourth and eldest, Augusto does not, and he's about to break away from the family: he's in love with Lucia and planning to move to the city. Augusto's sister Guilia clumsily tries to frustrate the lovers, while another brother, Alessandro, hatches a far-reaching plot to free himself of his mother's demands and other family responsibilities, to give Augusto the wherewithal to leave with Lucia, and, perhaps, to pursue incestuous impulses with his sister. Does anything stand in his way?
