Short film utilizing quick cuts and multiple angles of a one-man-band musical performance by Sid Lavarents (who served as both film-maker and musician). Added to the National Film Registry, Library of Congress for 2000.
For Christmas, Adelaide Laverents gives her husband Sid Laverents a reel-to-reel tape recorder. With it, he lays down track after track, with a metronome clicking away in the background keeping precise time for each track. These recordings are just a springboard to the final product, which is a rendering of Felix Arndt's song "Nola". Using a split screen, Sid is shown playing all the parts on conventional and improvised instruments, including the non-text vocals and whistling, with the only constants throughout being the metronome and Sid.
