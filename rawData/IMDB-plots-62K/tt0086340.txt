Sword and sorcery story of the cosmic struggle between white magic and black magic.
Hell-bent on becoming the ultimate ruler of the universe by sacrificing his firstborn, the powerful conjurer of illusions and master of the Black Arts, Traigon, makes an unholy pact with the evil deity, Kalghara. However, fate has other plans, and as the magician's wife gives her last breath to protect her newborn twin daughters, Traigon dies. Nearly two long decades later--imbued with the unlimited white force of their mentor, Krona--the dauntless warrior-sisters, Mira and Mara, embark on a dangerous mission to avenge their slaughtered mother and to defeat the resurrected warlock once and for all. Who shall live and who shall die in the final clash between good and evil?
To maintain his powers, the evil wizard Traigon must sacrifice his firstborn child to the god Caligara. His wife, however, has other ideas and runs away after giving birth with her twin daughters. Before dying, she hands the girls over to the warrior Krona who promises to raise them as great soldiers. Twenty years later, Traigon returns and begins hunting down his daughters once again. Will the twins, with the help of the Barbarian Erlik and the Viking Baldar, be able to defeat their father?
