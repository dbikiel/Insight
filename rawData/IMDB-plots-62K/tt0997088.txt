The story of Nazi Germany's plundering of Europe's great works of art during World War II and Allied efforts to minimize the damage.
THE RAPE OF EUROPA takes the audience on a journey through seven countries telling a story of greed and warfare that threatened the artistic heritage of Europe. For twelve years, the Nazis looted and destroyed art. Young art historians and curators from America and across Europe fought back, mounting a campaign to rescue and return countless art works displaced by the war. Joan Allen narrates this chronicle about the battle over centuries of western culture.
"The Rape of Europa" uses interviews with eyewitnesses and historians and newsreel footage to show how heroic Europeans, Russians, and Americans worked to save the art of Europe during WWII. The Nazis stole thousands of pieces of art and destroyed many others. But many individuals evacuated art and the American "Monuments Men" helped map out air strikes to avoid the destruction of many masterpieces. It is harrowing and moving to see art restored to the families of Jewish victims of the Holocaust.
