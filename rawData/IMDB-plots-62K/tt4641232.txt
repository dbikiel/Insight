A kaleidoscopic exploration of what our sense of smell has to do with memory, emotion, and sex.
Acclaimed filmmaker Kim Nguyen makes his debut in the documentary genre with an exploration of the importance of our sense of smell. The key role that olfaction plays in our everyday life is analyzed by sommeliers, perfume creators, truffle hunters and other people whose lives and careers are intimately linked to the nose.
The pleasures of food, of the erotic, of family - form the very fabric of our emotional lives. And smell is an essential emotional trigger. There is more truth to call our sense of smell our sense of desire because it springs our passions. Smell moves us, subliminally and profoundly. It moves us to act and do things we are wholly unaware of. It enriches our lives, gives us with unspeakable joys. All along this feature-length documentary, central storylines take us into the world of smell. Many of them have the suspense, death-defying risk and insanity of a an ultimate quest. Others, are moments of pure poetry.
