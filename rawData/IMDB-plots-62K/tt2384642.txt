A day in Cagliari narrated by the young Caterina.
Cate is eleven years old, with many brothers, a feckless, jobless father, and hard-working, frazzled mother. She lives on the outskirts of Cagliari, but would like to escape: she dreams of being a singer, she doesn't want to end up like her sister Mandarina, who got pregnant at the age of thirteen, or like Samantha, the girl-object of the neighborhood. Only Gigi, a neighbor, deserves his love. But today, August 3rd, Gigi's life is in danger: Tonio, one of Cate's brothers, wants to kill him. Meanwhile Cate spends with Luna, her best friend, the longest day of their lives, between the neighborhood, the sea and the streets of the center.
