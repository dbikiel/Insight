Marco Tucci is the standard tourist type, on his way to Puerto Deseado where he intends to fish for sharks. Or at least, this is the way he looks.

Didn't he go for a 2099 km drive all the way from Buenos Aires to Patagonia because Ana, his estranged daughter, lives there, with a view to reconnecting with her...?
