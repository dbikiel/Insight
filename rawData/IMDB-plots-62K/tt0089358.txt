The adventures of two retired vaudeville performers, who become two of the best prohibition Agents in the 1920s.
This is the film based on the true adventures of Izzy and Moe. They were two retired vaudeville performers who, being unemployed, decided to become Prohibition Enforcement Agents. They are initially treated with scorn from fellow Agents as old men pretending to be cops. That abuse soon stops when the pair refuse to use the standard but futile methods of the agency, and instead employ their theatrical experience to use an amazing variety of disguises and tricks to become two of the most effective agents on the force. Eventually, their outstanding string of successful raids and arrests starts drawing the attention of the mob and their bought cops, who desperately plan to stop this pair.
