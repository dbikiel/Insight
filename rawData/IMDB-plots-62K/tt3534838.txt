A series of montages that parodies the introductory title sequences of generic 70s, 80s and 90s TV shows of various genres slowly turns into an absurdist meta slasher and then the parody becomes even weirder.
Too Many Cooks is a dark comedy short that originally aired as a special during Adult Swim's "infomercials" block on October 28, 2014, at 4:00 am Eastern Time. It is ostensibly the intro credits of a TV show named "Too Many Cooks", but devolves into a meta-exploration of different TV genres with an ongoing plot line involving a killer attempting to infiltrate the show.
