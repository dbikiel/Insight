This mockumentary follows the fictional career of Harvey Wallinger, ostensible chief aide and adviser to Richard Nixon, from Nixon's time as Eisenhower's vice-president through his loss in the 1960 election to John F. Kennedy to his own eventual election as U.S. president in 1968. Wallinger gives Nixon advice over the course of his career and, in numerous interviews, catalogs the attitudes, skills, and insight that made Nixon as great as Nixon thought he was.
