In 1943, an American fishing boat has a fateful encounter with a seriously damaged Danish schooner off of Canada's Atlantic coast.
During the war off Nova Scotia a fishing boat comes across a badly damaged Danish schooner with only the captain aboard after it has apparently been shelled by a German U-boat. Not realising the sinister real purpose of the larger boat, the fishermen agree to tow it into an isolated harbour.
During World War II, Pat Bannon's whaler sights a shell-ridden Danish four-rigger in the waters off of Newfoundland. The crew has fled and only Captain Skalder is aboard. Thinking it has been a victim of a German U-boat, Bannon agrees to tow the vessel to a small Newfoundland port, the destination of the whaler's sole passenger, Margaret McLean. During the voyage it becomes apparent that one of the whaler's crew is a Nazi agent. In port, Bannon and Conrad, a crewman who proves loyal to the Allied cause, discover the the vessel they aided is a U-boat supply ship.
Pat Bannon is captain of the Daniel Webster, a commercial fishing boat. It's 1943 and he's had trouble crewing his boat with many men now in the armed forces. He sets off with a new crewman, Konrad and a female passenger, Margaret McLean, who is paying him to transport her to Newfoundland. Not long after departure they find that their wireless radio has been severely damaged. They soon come across a badly damaged Danish schooner, the Magre Kulinda out of Copenhagen. It's captain, Henrik Skalder, agrees to be escorted to Newfoundland but he has a reason for wanting to go to an Allied port and it's left to Bannon to stop him.
