After the Civil War, ex-Confederate soldiers heading for a new life in Mexico run into ex-Union cavalrymen selling horses to the Mexican government but they must join forces to fight off Mexican bandits and revolutionaries.
After the Civil War, ex-Union Colonel John Henry Thomas and ex-Confederate Colonel James Langdon are leading two disparate groups of people through strife-torn Mexico. John Henry and company are bringing horses to the unpopular Mexican government for $35 a head while Langdon is leading a contingent of displaced southerners, who are looking for a new life in Mexico after losing their property to carpetbaggers. The two men are eventually forced to mend their differences in order to fight off both bandits and revolutionaries, as they try to lead their friends and kin to safety.
At the end of the US Civil War, Confederate Colonel James Langdon leads a group of his men and their families to Mexico where the Emperor Maximillian has promised them land and the opportunity to start a new life. Along the way, they encounter John Henry Thomas, a former Union cavalry officer. While suspicious of their new acquaintances, the Confederates slowly develop an admiration for Thomas and his men. When Colonel Langdon finds himself in the middle of the Mexican revolution, it's Thomas and his men who come to their rescue.
