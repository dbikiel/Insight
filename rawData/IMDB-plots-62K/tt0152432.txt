Goof and Hugo are flatmates in Amsterdam who have made a tidy sum from having sex with tourists, then robbing them. Their goal is to spend the money together on a world trip and their scam is going well until they meet Lara, originally from Siberia, whom Goof becomes besotted with.
Gentle Goof and his domineering mate Hugo have turned the art of seducing into a criminal profession, as they systematically rob their one-night-stands, usually tourists, in the morning. Lara however captures Goof's heart to the point that he refuses to let her be robbed by either of them, even if that endangers their partnership. He now wishes to earn enough to travel to Siberia, her declared home. They're all three in for surprises.
