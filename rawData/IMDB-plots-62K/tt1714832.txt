A middle class family in India tries to buy a new car.
Delhi-based math teacher Santosh Duggal drives a scooter and lives in a small apartment along with his wife, Kusum; a collegian daughter, Payal; and a school-going son, Sandeep. He also moonlights with a tutoring center called Chatwal Coaching Class in order to make ends meet. Hoping to pacify his family with his income-tax refund, he will instead be compelled to give up its entire amount after his Meerut-based sister Urmi invites them over to a wedding. He borrows a car from a neighbor, Farooqui, and, after a rather dramatic trip, is forced to compensate him as the car gets damaged. Unable to bear taunts that he cannot afford a car, he decides to buy one. It is this decision that will force Payal to seek employment in a call center. Sandeep will confess that he has been gambling, which leaves Santosh with no alternative but to consider accepting bribes from students and risk being exposed on live TV.
