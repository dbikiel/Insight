After the assassination of a Cambodian union leader, filmmaker Bradley Cox tracks down witnesses and unravels the police plot that framed two men.

Filmed as events unfolded, WHO KILLED CHEA VICHEA? reaches far beyond the police station and the courtroom, to the top of the ruling party. It's a front-row seat to a world of corruption, calculation, and courage.
