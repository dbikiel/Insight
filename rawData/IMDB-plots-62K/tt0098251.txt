Juan is a young Spanish man whose dream is to become one of the famous toreros. When he was caught making an illegal (and in fact for the real torero life endangering) night bullfight with one of the destinated bulls for the corridas on the property of the Sols he meets the daughter of the American landowner Dona Sol, half Spanish, half American, and falls desperately in love with her. She brings him in contact with a famous torero and thus converts Juan into one of the famous, too. Still in love with Dona Sol, although married to the beautiful Carmen, Juan celebrates triumphes until Dona Sol lets him down. Drinking and being desperate only Carmen would stand by his side when he tries to come back in the corrida buisiness...
