Two friends who own an investment firm turn to a policeman friend for help when they are framed for robbery by a gang of antiquities smugglers.
King Kong (Samuel Hui) and Albert "Baldy" Au (Karl Maka) were framed for robbery by brother and sister thieves (Leslie Cheung and Nina Li Chi), taking possession of a magnificent sword from antiquities smugglers. The smugglers attempt to hunt down Kong and Baldy, just as they were being pursued by the Hong Kong Police for their supposed "crime." Kong and Baldy managed to reprimand the brother/sister duo, but were all ultimately apprehended by the authorities and sent to a prison in China, putting their innocence and freedom in jeopardy.
