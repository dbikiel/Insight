A man getting on in years sets out to find a way to resurrect his flagging virility.
An ageing antique specialist in Kyoto, Japan is losing virility but finds himself excited when he deliberately makes his daughter's boyfriend attracted to his younger beautiful wife. Things begin to spiral as his health declines and the plotted becomes the plotting.
Almost impotent, battling with senility in vain, Kenji Kenmochi, an elderly art critic and esteemed antique collector, finds it difficult to come to terms with his waning virility, despite the fact that he is married to a much younger wife, the beautiful Ikuko. As a result, to boost up his potency, the art expert visits frequently the young Dr Kimura who is in a relationship with his daughter, Toshiko, unbeknownst to the physician, however, that the only thing that sustains Kenji's youth, is jealousy. And then, unexpectedly, when Ikuko becomes drunk one night, Kenji will hatch a cunning plot; one that involves his unsuspecting wife, his daughter, Dr Kimura, and above all, his perverse and irrepressible libido.
