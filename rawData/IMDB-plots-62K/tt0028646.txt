Young Englishman inherits ranch which he wants to sell, but Gene's gonna turn him into a real westerner instead..
When new owner Spud arrives from England, Autry convinces him not to sell the ranch but to raise horses for the Army. When both Autry's and Neale's bids are the same, the Colonel calls for a race to decide the winner. But that night Neale has Autry's stable burned.
Edward (Ronald Sinclair), The Earl of Granby, young owner of the ranch Gene Autry (Gene Autry) manages, arrives in America to sell it. Gene, realizing the grief this sale would have on all the old ranch hands who have spent most of their lives on the ranch, and appreciating the potential value of the cattle, tries to persuade the young owner (who calls himself Spud) and his guardian "Windy" Wyndham (John Ward) against selling. But "Spud" insists on the grounds that his father had died leaving no money on which to operate the ranch. He is on the verge of selling it to an unscrupulous rancher,Jim Neale (Bill Elliott), when he learns that Neale intends to use it as a place for breaking in wild horses, and subsequently selling them to the U.S. Army. Gene persuades "Spud" to keep the ranch and using it the same way himself. Neale is furious. Gene, Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette) , "Spud" and the ranch-hands determine to get the army-remount-service contract They ride to the army post and Gene meets Bernice Allen (Judith Allen), the daughter of the purchasing colonel, and a warm friendship ensues. Colonel Allen (Guy Usher) announces that Gene's and Neale's bids are identical, so a horse race will decide the winner of the contract. Things get rough after that.
