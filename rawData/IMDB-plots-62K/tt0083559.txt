The climbing of an immense staircase made up of the most varied stairs. Symbolic scenes occur on different levels where characters seem to be prisoners of their deeds and of their own folly. Attacks, explosions, maniacal and despairing searching, objects which independently move, walls, floors and ceilings which form and disperse. The steep staircase leads little by little towards the zones of great light where human beings and nonhuman beings meet.
