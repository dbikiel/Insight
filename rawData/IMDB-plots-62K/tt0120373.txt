An actor poses as a lawyer to help his sick friend, and problems develop.
Lawyer Charlie Tuttle is defending his wife's relative Benny Gibbs in a class action fraud suit, but when he gets to the city where court takes place, he gets drunk and the following day, when the hearings begin, his friend, actor Richard Rjetti takes his place posing as Charlie. The bad thing is that Richard doesn't know anything about being a lawyer, and Charlie has to teach him as the court goes on.
Charlie's a lawyer who's about to get married. His best friend, Richard, an actor shows up and Charlie needs to go to a small town to handle a case. But because Richard got him so drunk, he couldn't appear in court so Richard takes his place. He tries to get a continuance but the judge orders either he accepts the plea that was agreed to or go to trial and he decides to go to trial. And when the judge won't let Charlie in the court room, he needs to find a way to coach him. The prosecutor intrigues Richard and she thinks he's a creep because his client is guilty of defrauding so many people. Charlie's taken with a waitress even though he's engaged.
