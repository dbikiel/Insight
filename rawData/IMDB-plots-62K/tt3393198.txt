80 years ago antibiotics revolutionized medicine. Only now are we realizing the potentially catastrophic consequences of these miracle drugs. The question is: have we reached a point where we must save antibiotics to save ourselves? RESISTANCE uses interviews, archival material, and verite footage to untangle the web of factors behind the global crisis of antibiotic resistance. Experts and ordinary individuals who've faced resistance first hand reveal how our use of antibiotics has created profound challenges not only for hospitals, but for much of modern life - from our food supply to our personal health. With their help the film clarifies what's at stake, what's driving the problem and how we might turn the tide.
