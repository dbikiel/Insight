A young man sets out to avenge his grandfather's death and prove his martial arts mastery.
A brother and sister escape from Japanese-occupied Shanghai to Japanese-occupied Taiwan, to stay with their grandfather who runs a Kung-Fu school there. However, the master of a Japanese Kung- Fu school in Taiwan has designs on bringing all other schools on the island under his domination, and part of his plan involves the murder of the siblings' grandfather. Undaunted, the brother and sister reestablish their grandfather's school, leading to a final confrontation with the Japanese Kung Fu master. Jackie Chan plays a young thief who at first does not want to learn Kung-Fu, but finally realizes that he can no longer stand by and let the Japanese trample the rights of the Chinese people. He proves extremely adept at the martial arts, and carries the fight to its final conclusion.
After being betrayed by the Japanese in Shanghai, the remnants of Jing Wu School escape to Japan-controlled Taiwan where they encounter a promising but stubborn young man; both of whom conflict with the authorities and a karate master seeking to quell any rebellion.
Jackie Chan stars as A Lung in this martial arts feature. A Lung is recruited by Lier, the fiance of Chen Cen, to help her defend the Ching Wu Martial Arts School which is under attack by the Japanese. A Lung is not prepared to tolerate the Japanese oppression and organises a rebellion which leads to a dramatic ending.
