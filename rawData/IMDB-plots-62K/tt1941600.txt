In the 70s Matteusz Gdula invented an acting method that was supposed to make every actor "shine". Still, lots of his students die mysteriously and Gdula commits suicide. His method gets banned. Now: Stella, an ambitious, but rather untalented drama student, gets accepted at the "Matteusz Gdula"-school. When she bears witness to some strange occurrences, she gets drawn into the bizarre and deadly web that surrounds the dark secret of the school...
After yet another unsuccessful audition, Stella, an aspiring actress, is offered the opportunity to enroll at the Matteusz Gdula Institute, an acting school in Berlin. After enrolling, she discovers the school's dark history: in the 1970s, many students died, and Gdula himself later committed suicide. Stella, desperate to succeed, ignores both the school's past and the police investigation into the death of a current student and dives headlong into Gdula's disturbing "method".
