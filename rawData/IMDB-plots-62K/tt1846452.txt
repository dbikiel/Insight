John and Jenn are young, in love and living together. But this is no dreamy tale of magical romance from director Barry Jenkins.
John and Jenn are young, in love and living together. But this is no dreamy tale of magical romance from MEDICINE FOR MELANCHOLY director Barry Jenkins. The filmmaker turns his camera on his friends to learn what it actually takes to share a life. As he explores the shared space of their tiny San Francisco apartment and observes their rhythms, they answer his gentle questions with a fumbling authenticity that communicates volumes about commitment. - Sean Axmaker
