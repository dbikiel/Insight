Finn Baxter sets up booby traps to catch the ghost of his new home's former occupant, only to discover he must protect the house and his sister from three bumbling art thieves.
Finn Baxter and his family move from California to Maine to their new house. Finn is terrified, and believes the house is haunted. While he sets up traps to catch the "ghost", his parents get stranded across town, and Finn is home alone with his sister. Their house is targeted by three thieves.
Convinced that their new home in Maine shows signs of intense paranormal activity, the ten-year-old video-game lover, Finn Baxter, sets up an elaborate network of booby traps to catch the invisible intruder in action. Left home alone with his older sister, Alexis, the siblings are utterly unaware that a trio of art-thieves has already targeted the family's house. Now, amid a raging snowstorm, and with their parents at a Christmas party, Finn and Alexis will have to take matters into their own hands, and thwart the burglars' plans. Is the house truly haunted? What lies hidden in the Baxters' dark basement?
When the Baxter Family relocates from sunny California to Maine, 8-year-old Finn Baxter is convinced the new house is haunted by notorious gangster/bootlegger, Jimmy "Deadleg" Gravano, who passed away inside the residence while being asphyxiated in his own bed. Terrified and stricken, Finn decides to set up traps to capture this "christmas spirit," which prove to be useful against three bumbling art thieves (Malcolm McDowell, Debi Mazar, Eddie Steeples) who target the household in search of a highly valuable painting previously owned by Gravano. Now home alone with his sister (Jodelle Ferland) while his parents are stranded across town attending a holiday party, can Finn acquire the courage to protect his sister and domicile while matching wits with a trio of determined thieves?
