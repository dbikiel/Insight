A country music star must turn an obnoxious New York cabbie into a singer in order to win a bet.
Jake, an aspiring singer from Tennessee comes to New York City and finds herself working in club owned by a sleazy guy named Freddy. It seems Jake is under contract, and Freddy doesn't want to let her go. So Jake makes a bet; that she can train anyone to sing, and if she does, he lets her out of her contract, and the guy she has to train is a cabbie named Nick. They go to her house in Tennessee, and Jake tries to teach him, but it's very tough.
