Twelve-year-old, well-bred Lonnie meets the impudent Karen on the street. They spend some time together and Karen teaches Lonnie some of her favorite pastimes, like make-up, shop-lifting, skipping school and lying to her parents about it, but confessing to the priest later. But Karen also learns some honesty from Lonnie. A film about social differences and growing up.
