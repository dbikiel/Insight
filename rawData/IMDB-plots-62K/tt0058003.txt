In an industrial area, Giuliana, an unstable woman, attempts to cope with life by starting an affair with a co-worker at the plant her husband manages.
In a bleak rundown industrial area a young woman, Giuliana, tries to cope with life. She's married to Ugo the manager of a local plant but is soon having an affair with one of his co-workers, Corrado Zeller, who is visiting. Giuliana is unstable, not quite knowing anymore just what her role is, whether that be a wife, a mother or just another person. Her escape from life is short-lived however as Zeller is simply using her to satisfy his own needs and desires.
Against the grim backdrop of Ravenna's barren industrial wastelands brimming with flame-belching factories and deleterious chemical fumes, Giuliana, a deeply dejected young mother on the brink of a total existential breakdown, seeks solace in one of her neglectful husband's handsome associates, Corrado Zeller. Alienated after that horrible car accident and utterly disarmed by him, Giuliana shall embark on a hasty and shallow affair in the hope of overcoming the insurmountable obstacles of her profound, yet quiet mental anguish; however, her spiritual catharsis still seems so far away. In the end, is isolation Giuliana's only refuge?
Cold, rain, and fog surround a plant in Ravenna. Factory waste pollutes local lakes; hulking anonymous ships pass or dock and raise quarantine flags. Guiliana, a housewife married to the plant manager, Ugo, is mentally ill, hiding it from her husband as best she can. She meets Zeller, an engineer en route to Patagonia to set up a factory. He pursues her, they join friends for a dinner party of sexual play, then, while Ugo is away on business, she fears that her son has polio. When she discovers the boy is faking, she goes to Zeller, panicked that no one needs her. He takes advantage of her distress, and she is again alone and ill.
