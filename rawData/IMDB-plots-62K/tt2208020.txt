A not-too-bright cop searches for a serial bomber.
A series of bombings occur and police track a lead, where they find the male protagonist Ichiro Suzuki and believe he is somehow involved. After psychiatric evaluation and rigorous questioning, the man is found to be emotionally vacant, highly intelligent with a savant-like photographic memory, physically strong and unable to feel any pain. The female lead who plays psychiatrist Mariko Mashiya is intrigued and attempts to discover what and how he came to this state, fueled by her own past personal tragedy and determination to seek the truth. Is he the psychopath they are all looking for?
