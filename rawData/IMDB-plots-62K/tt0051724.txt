A tough kid comes to a new high school and begins muscling his way into the drug scene. As he moves his way up the ladder, a schoolteacher tries to reform him, his aunt tries to seduce him, and the "weedheads" are eager to use his newly found enterprise, but he has his own agenda. After an altercation involving fast cars, hidden drugs, and police, he's accepted by the drug kingpin and is off into the big leagues. A typical morality play of the era, filled with a naive view of drugs, nihilistic beat poetry, and some incredible '50s slang.
According to the police, the scourge of drugs has hit Santa Bellow High School. At the same time, insolent and brash transfer student Tony Baker has just arrived at the school, having been kicked out of his previous school and having been put back several times. Tony makes a strong impression amongst both the staff and students. With the former, English teacher and guidance counselor Arlene Williams hopes to provide a positive influence on Tony, despite him always hitting on her. With the latter, Tony quickly infiltrates the Wheeler-Dealers, the local gang involved in the drug scene, and which includes directly or by association J.I. Coleridge and Joan Staples, a marijuana addict. Tony wants to make it big within this setting as the dealer of choice, but he has to find out who the major supplier in the area is. Maneuvering through the drug trade, Tony finally makes his way to the top of the local supply chain. But just before the big deal, a withdrawal laden Joan may cause some problems for Tony before he can show his true intentions.
