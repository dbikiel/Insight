Two survivors of the initial Magnificent Seven outfit, Chris and Vin, recruit four new members in order to re-form the outfit and defend a few Mexican villages from attacks by vicious bandits.
After Calvera's defeat in The Magnificent Seven (1960), the love-smitten member of the original Seven, Chico, has started a family with his wife, Petra, in the now-liberated Mexican village. Three peaceful years later--as sixty gunmen of the tyrannical rancher, Lopez, round up the farmers to construct a church and a monument for his two dead sons--once more, it's up to Chris to assemble a septet of protectors and defend the villagers. However, can the new Magnificent Seven do the impossible and restore peace?
Chico, one of the remaining members of The Magnificent Seven, has set down roots in the village that they had defended in the first film. One day, the village is raided by fifty gunmen under the employ of rancher Lorca. Lorca's bandits abduct all of the village's men to be used as slave labor, leaving the women and children behind. Chris, the former leader of the Seven, is sought out by Chico's wife Petra for help, and thus assembles a new Seven to come to the village's rescue once again.
When a bandit leader wants to build a church in memory of his dead sons, he raids three Mexican villages and kidnaps all the men for labour. One of these men is Chico, formerly of the original Magnificent Seven. His wife Petra immediately sets out to look for Chris and Vin, the other surviving members of the Seven. Chris recruits four others (a playboy, an avenger, a highwayman and an orphan) to reform the Seven, once again defending farmers from their oppressors.
