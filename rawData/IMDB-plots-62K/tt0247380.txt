Varda films and interviews gleaners in France in all forms, from those picking fields after the harvest to those scouring the dumpsters of Paris.
An intimate, picaresque inquiry into French life as lived by the country's poor and its provident, as well as by the film's own director, Agnes Varda. The aesthetic, political and moral point of departure for Varda are gleaners, those individuals who pick at already-reaped fields for the odd potato, the leftover turnip.
In this documentary director Agn√®s Varda deals with the issue of wealth and poverty in modern day France by exploring the world of gleaners and pickers. Gleaners are individuals who search farmers' fields for produce the mechanical harvesting equipment may have left behind. In potato fields, the poor collect what potatoes can be found but also from crops that are rejected because of minor damage or size. In urban areas gleaners will pick through garbage cans to collect whatever food items have been thrown by supermarkets. Pickers on the other hand are those who collect non-food items put out for refuse collection. These can simply be recycled or used to produce self-styled art. The focus however is that in a land of plenty, there is a great of waste while many are left wanting.
