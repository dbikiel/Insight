Once known as Mad Max Julien was the star of the illegal street racing scene Montreal. Then it took an accident and the beautiful Morgan to his senses, and Julien has a sturdy construction worker and family man. Now needs Morgane within a few days for a donor heart, otherwise it is out with her, but the list of Waiting is so long as the donor shortly. So Julie decided yet to do even what he does best, and the underworld, so to speak in to pinch passing a central agency. An adrenaline-soaked action-thriller from the French-speaking part of Canada takes in content and style borrowed from various genres younger colleagues and his breathless chase enriched with mainly by Flashbacks in the story mounted romance. Not all acts covered by or particularly convincing, but from the perspective of the inclined Actionfundamentalisten between auto racing, macho slogans, desert stylish fights and a pinch of Parkour quite worried for entertainment.
