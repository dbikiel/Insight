Tells the life story of a wolf named Lobo. He grows from a playful, curious cub into a wolf with a huge bounty on his head. Along the way he makes friends with deer, tangles with rattlesnakes, has a family, and matches wits with man. The movie doesn't try to sugarcoat the truth and is as close to real life as can be in a movie.
