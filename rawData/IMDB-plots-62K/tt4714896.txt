Eric Liddell - China's first gold medalist and one of Scotland's greatest athletes - returns to war-torn China.
Eric Liddell may have won gold for the United Kingdom and possessed a lilting Highland brogue, but he was born in China and lived more than half his life there evangelizing and teaching. On Wings of Eagles is everything you ever wanted to know about what happened to Liddell - who famously refused to run an Olympic race on a Sunday to honor God - after the 1924 Olympics when he returned to China, the home of his heart. But Eric's beloved homeland is about to be occupied by Imperial Japan.
