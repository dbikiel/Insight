After inhabiting dozens of comical alter-egos over the course of her award-winning career, Tracey Ullman finally 'takes on' the one role that spawned all of her characters--herself. This exclusive HBO comedy event features Tracey in a rare, on-stage performance in which she explores the twists, turns and triumphs that have shaped her remarkable life and hilarious personas. Taped before a live audience at the Henry Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles, this autobiographical show traces Tracey's life from her childhood and her early career in dancing, acting and music to her rise to stardom in both TV and movies.
