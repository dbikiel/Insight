The untold story of how hip-hop's most commercial and iconic sub-genre came to be.
During the early 90s the G Funk style of hip-hop emerged from Los Angeles, combining melodic elements of Motown, Funk, and R&amp;B with socially-aware gangsta rap. For the first time in history, a hip-hop album debuted at #1 on the pop charts and the genre became a staple of mainstream American culture. The movement began with Warren G, Snoop Dogg, and Nate Dogg. As childhood friends, the trio formed the group 213 and were discovered by Death Row Records. Death Row went on to support Snoop Dogg and Nate Dogg, and while the two rose to international stardom, Warren G moved back to Long Beach with hopes of making it on his own. The film follows his rise and the impact of G Funk on pop culture.
