It is the last, great war. Out of the wreckage of a troop transport, five soldiers on the way to battle find themselves stranded on the dark side of the moon. Cut off and behind enemy lines, they start a dangerous journey through snipers and minefields back to their home territory. As their numbers dwindle and nerves fray, they make an amazing discovery about the moon that just might save their lives.
In the near future humanity has settled on the moon to find water in the craters since the earth is contaminated. A fierce fight ensues over limited resources. A spaceship is shot down behind enemy lines and the five surviving soldiers have to get to a rescue point while running out of oxygen.
