A woman engaged to marry a self-centered film and stage director/choreographer falls for a caterer whom she kisses, as does he for her.
Unwinding her relationship from a controlling choreographer, Kayla happens to take an elevator ride with lonesome caterer "Dustin". The lift stalls, and spontaneously, magical kisses follow. Soon the choreographer makes nice, and Dustin retreats. Kayla becomes confused as to which man to love.
