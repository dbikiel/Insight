Lola, a divorce lawyer, has two brothers: Benoit, owner of an optical shop, and Pierre, who works demolishing buildings. Everything seems to keep these three siblings apart, although, in reality, they are inseparable. In fact, they usually gather in the cemetery next to the grave of their deceased parents. Together, they will share the ups and downs of their respective lives: Benoit's wedding, marriage crisis and fatherhood; Lola's relationship with Zoher, a former client of her, and Pierre's labor problems.
