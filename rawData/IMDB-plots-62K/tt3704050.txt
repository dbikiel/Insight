With the aid of a fellow Auschwitz survivor and a hand-written letter, an elderly man with dementia goes in search of the person he believes to be responsible for the death of his family in the death camp to kill him himself.
"Remember" is the contemporary story of Zev, who discovers that the Nazi guard who murdered his family some 70 years ago is living in America under an assumed identity. Despite the obvious challenges, Zev sets out on a mission to deliver long-delayed justice with his own trembling hand. What follows is a remarkable cross-continent road-trip with surprising consequences.
Coached at a distance by his rest home friend Max Rosenbaum (Martin Landau), Zev Gutman (Christopher Plummer) is led step-by-step on a search for an ex-Nazi prison camp guard living under the assumed name of Rudy Kurlander. The Wiesenthal Center has found four possible suspects and Gutman must find - and execute - the right one in retaliation for his own family's death at Auschwitz. Benjamin August's script skillfully builds the tension of Gutman's somewhat haphazard search toward an ending that is so surprising that you'll just have to see it for yourself.
