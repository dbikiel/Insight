The New York police investigates the murder of a Czech immigrant whose rags-to-riches story is told by his secretary to homicide detectives.
When Clementi Suborin is found murdered, his secretary recounts to the police the story of his rise from Czech refugee to ultra-rich New Yorker. The tale of betrayal, womanising and fraud confirms that almost everyone who knew him wanted him dead.
