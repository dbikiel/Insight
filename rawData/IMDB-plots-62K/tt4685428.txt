Shifting from one pocket to another, from one man's drama to another, a lowly dollar bill, 'one buck' takes us on an odyssey through the heart of a forgotten town in Louisiana.
Shifting from one pocket to another, from one man's drama to
another, a lowly dollar bill, "one buck" takes us on an odyssey
through the heart of a forgotten town in Louisiana. Along the
journey of "one buck", we encounter Harry who is immersed in
a downward spiral brought about by the sudden and violent
death of his wife. In its transitions from each hopeless hand to
another and each desperate character to the next, "one buck"
bears witness to different facets of irresistible vice enticed by
money. If money could talk, this is its disturbing tale of the dark
side and of moral disintegration in society. Harry's self
destruction is the highlight of the stories and his demise serves
to be his redemption.
