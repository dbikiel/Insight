Set over the course of one day, a narcotics detective hunts for a seemingly harmless young criminal who knows a truth about the cop's past.
When narcotics detective Eugene 'Mack' McCanick discovers that a seemingly harmless young criminal, Simon Weeks, has been released from prison, it triggers a firestorm of paranoia and violence. Mack and his partner, Floyd, mercilessly hunt down Weeks for unknown reasons over the course of one long, hot day. The closer Mack gets to his prey, the more we understand that his frenzy stems from a truth from the past, which only Weeks can expose. The truth is revealed in the explosive finale, which culminates in a surprisingly emotional confrontation not just between McCanick and Weeks, but also between McCanick and himself.
In Philadelphia, on the day of the fifty-ninth anniversary of Detective Eugene 'Mack' McCanick, he learns that Simon Weeks has been released. Captain Jerry Quinn asks Mack to forget Simon Weeks, but Mack lures his partner Floyd Intrator "Mike Vogel" to chase Weeks with tragic consequences. In flashbacks, the relationship between Mack and Weeks is disclosed.
