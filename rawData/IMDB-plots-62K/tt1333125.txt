A series of interconnected short films follows a washed-up producer as he pitches insane story lines featuring some of the biggest stars in Hollywood.
Ineffectual, 'has-been' film-maker (Dennis Quaid) swindles his way into an interview with a film executive (Greg Kinnear) in order to pitch an outrageous and controversial comedy manuscript. After pitching the first of his thirteen offbeat fables, the dejected artist forces the rest of his disjointed allegory on the executive at gunpoint. He tells stories of a woman on a blind date with a man who has testicles growing from his neck, in another a smitten woman offers her neck to her boyfriend to 'poop' on -as a sign of commitment and love. In yet another two parents take home-schooling to a whole new level of indecency, striving to give their isolated teenage son all the 'regular' torment and humiliation of puberty by bullying, peer-pressuring and even seducing him themselves. An off-beat, elephant-in-the-room type film.
Struggling screenwriter Charlie Wessler has managed to get a pitch meeting with studio executive Griffin Schraeder. The many ideas Charlie pitches, each with a shocking twist, include: a woman unable to contain her horror at the unaddressed obvious physical issue with a blind date, one of the most eligible bachelors in town; parents who do whatever needed to make sure their home-schooled teenaged son's academic experience is as typical as possible; a man's efforts to accommodate an "if you love me" request from his fiancée; a young couple's troubled relationship played out, unknown to them, on the loudspeaker of his workplace, a big box retailer; a corporate managers' meeting to discuss a design flaw with their latest release, the iBabe; Robin, of Batman &amp; Robin, trying to speed date without the interference of his much higher profile partner; two middle-schoolers, on a date at his house, when she experiences her first period in a testosterone-laden environment; the issues around a birthday gift a guy gives to his male roommate; a couple on a blind date who decide to get to the crux of their beings by playing truth or dare; a basketball coach using the "black" elephant in the room to spur on his players; and a woman's relationship with her boyfriend's animated cat, Beezel, and Beezel's fantasy relationship with the boyfriend. As the meeting progresses, Griffin comes to an obvious conclusion about the ideas while also coming to a revelation about the genesis of the meeting itself. He has to figure out how to handle dealing with Charlie in light of these issues and Charlie's reaction to Griffin figuring things out.

"The Pitch"In this wrap-around segment, Charlie Wessler (Dennis Quaid) is an insane screenwriter who is attempting to pitch a script to film executive Griffin Schraeder (Greg Kinnear). After revealing several of the stories in his script, Wessler becomes agitated when Schraeder dismisses his outrageous ideas, and he pulls a gun on him and forces him to listen to multiple other stories before making Schraeder consult his manager, Bob Mone (Common), to purchase the film. When they do so, Mone's condescending attitude toward Schraeder angers him to the point that, after agreeing to make the film "the biggest film since Howard the Duck", he confronts Mone in the parking lot and tries to humiliate him. Wessler tries to calm Schraeder with more story ideas to no avail, and the segment ends with it being revealed that it is being shot by a camera crew as part of this movie, leading into the final segments."The Thread"Calvin Cutler (Mark L. Young) and his friend J.J. (Adam Cagley) make a video in the style of MTV's Jackass and upload it on YouTube where it instantly reaches over 1,000,000 views.

Calvin and J.J. attempt to get revenge. They tell Baxter of a film that's so dangerous it'll cause the annihilation of the world. The movie is known as 'Movie 43'. While J.J. and Baxter look for Movie 43 on Google, Calvin retrieves Baxter's laptop and loads it with viruses from porn sites, and masturbates to the naked women on the porn sites in a bathroom. Baxter finds over hundreds of results for Movie 43 on a website referred to by him as a dark corner of the Internet. They find the sketches starting from the 43rd search on the list of results. As he and J.J. keep watching videos, they are interrupted by a man known as Vrankovich (Fisher Stevens) and a group of Chinese mobsters who are tempted to find Movie 43, even going as far as to take J.J.'s classmate Stevie Schraeder (Nate Hartley), film executive Griffin Schraeder's oldest son, hostage. Vrankovich warns them that if they find Movie 43, civilization will be left to ruins. They ignore his claims and keep searching. They eventually find the real, the one, and the only, Movie 43, which turns out to involve Baxter as a profane commando who leads a group of recruits to survive after the world has ended.

They also throw high school parties and Samantha simulates Kevin's "first kiss" with him.
