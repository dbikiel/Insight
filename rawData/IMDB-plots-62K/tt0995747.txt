In Moscow, a young woman disappears after falling in love with a new man.
The fanciful tale of an introverted little girl who grows up believing she has the power to make wishes come true. She must reconcile this belief with reality when, as a young woman, she journeys to Moscow and grapples with love, modernity and materialism.
Rusalka, or Mermaid, is a coming of age film. The main character lives partially in an imaginary world and partially in the real world where she can make her wishes magically come true. This film develops the dynamics of maneuvering through a strange family, moving to a big city, and falling for a friend. It is a unique film with upbeat music.
