A look at Communist musicals that strove to be ideologically correct - and entertaining, besides.
"That's Entertainment!," Communist style. A documentary about movie musicals produced during the height of the old Soviet bloc. Comrades drive tractors, sweep factory floors, feed farm animals, harvest crops, all the while singing their hearts out about the joys of socialism. Included are interviews with people involved in the making of some of these movies, as well as a film historian and nostalgic moviegoers.
