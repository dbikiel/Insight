Singing Johnny Norton is the star catcher of the Blue Sox baseball team but he is suspended because of insubordination. Producer Barney Crane hears Johnny singing and signs him to appear with Gloria Jackson, with the promise their first engagement will be in Havana. Johnny, hoping to get his baseball job back, is anxious to get to Cuba where the Blue Sox are having spring training. Patsy Clark, daughter of Blue Sox owner, Joe Clark, helps Johnny get another chance with the team. But Johnny has fallen in love with Gloria and hates to walk out on his singing contract. Johnny's troubles are solved when rain prevents the important All-Star exhibition game which was scheduled for the same evening.
