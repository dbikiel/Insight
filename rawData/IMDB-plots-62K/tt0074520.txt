Bruno Fioretti, known as "Mandrake", is an inveterate gambler who never misses a day at the horse racing track in Rome. He is always at the track together with his friends Armando Pellicci, known as "Er Pomata" cause his use of hair gel, and Felice. They always bet on the wrong horses and they always end up being penniless.
