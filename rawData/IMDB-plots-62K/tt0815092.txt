Marcelline is an actress. Forty, single and childless, she begins rehearsals for Turgenev's A MONTH IN THE COUNTRY. Denis, the director, admires her greatly and promises he'll make her happy on stage - she will shine. But things don't go to plan. Denis introduces Marcelline to his assistant, Nathalie. The two women were at drama school together twenty years earlier. Nathalie tells her she had to give up acting: she has a husband and children. Marcelline and Nathalie look at each other as if in a mirror, each seeing in the other the life she doesn't have, the dreams she cannot bear to abandon. Their meeting is the first in a series of tremors that will turn Marcelline's life upside down.
