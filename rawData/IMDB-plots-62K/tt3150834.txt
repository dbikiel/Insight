Five tries (chances )to say the most important things , through fear of being misunderstood and speechlessness. Five steps towards yourself ,through a reflection of the closest people .5 breathes , to keep going forward ,through emptiness and fear of death ,in searching and finding of true love .Different heroes walk this pass ,with only one desire ,to be heard and excepted for what they are . Is it possible ?
Life of characters is not a movie. That is why they make five steps towards themselves through touching closest people. From father to son, from a couple to best friend, from former lover to new true love. Wishing only to be heard and accepted as they are.
