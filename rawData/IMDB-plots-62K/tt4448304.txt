When Caitlyn, the most popular girl in school, mistakes new kid Davis for a vampire, he gains instant celebrity status. Davis enlists the help of his next-door neighbor, Vi, to dial up his vampire act. Together, will they fool the school?
When Davis, a vividly daydreaming 17-year-old Aussie male, enters his new American high school (one rife with chowderheads steeped in the lore of the Twilight books and films), Caitlyn, the school's most popular queen bee, mistakes him for a vampire. Vi (literally the-girl-next-door) likes this disruption to the stagnant social order and helps Davis build into the error, leading the lad to widespread popularity. Can Davis be honest with Caitlyn without bursting her bubble and alienating her and his new classmates?
