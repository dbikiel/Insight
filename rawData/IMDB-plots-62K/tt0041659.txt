In order to afford her daughter's college tuition, a woman enrolls herself at the same school aided by a rare large bursary but they both fall in-love with the same cute English professor.
Widow Abby Abbott is having serious money problems and has to dip into the family trust in order to pay for her daughter Susan's college tuition. The catch: Abby must also become a co-ed or she can't touch the money. After passing her entrance exams, Abby goes to college and becomes very popular, especially with a handsome English professor whom Susan has a crush on.
