Legendary pirate and adventurer Sinbad is in single-minded pursuit of two things: beautiful women and a substance called Greek Fire--an early version of gunpowder.
Sinbad was pursuing a secret weapon: Greek Fire. Attributed to the ancient Greeks, it was composed of pitch or bitumen, sulfur, and other ingredients. It was used in naval warfare and the Romans also made use of it but with the fall of the ancient Western world, it was temporarily forgotten, but it was rediscovered by the Arabs from whom European Crusaders also learned the method of making it.
This is a 1953 film originally shot in 3-D that, like usual for films that involved Howard Hughes, was finally released nearly two full years after its initial trade showings and the 3-D craze was long past. Primary problem was, much like "The French Line," getting PCA approval as, also like "The French Line," the female costumes left little unshown and unexploited. Pity. Sally Forrest and Mari Blanchard were made for 3-D. The Son of Sinbad and his buddy Omar are thrown in prison for visiting the harem of the Kalif once too often. Meanwhile the Kalif learns that Tammerlane the Cruel is planning to destroy his city if he doesn't surrender it. But with the aid of some early-day gunpowder, Sinbad and Omar save the day, aided by their 40-girl brigade that are all daughters of the original Forty Thieves... and all girl with a capital G.
