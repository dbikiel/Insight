Former mercenary Karl Thomasson returns once again as a substitute teacher, this time to infiltrate a military school's faculty to cease the actions of white supremacists.
A former mercenary joins a military academy as a teacher. He soon discovers a neo-Nazi group, code-named Werewolves, formed among the cadets. He also quickly finds that they have military leadership among the officers at the Academy.
Something's not right at General Teague's military school alma mater in Georgia. Racist philosophy has spread through the school, and has damaged the General's relationship with his nephew, Cadet Ted Teague. To ferret out white supremacy at the Military Academy he helps fund, the General calls upon former comrade Karl Thomasson. In his undercover role as an American History professor, Karl butts heads with a student named Buckner, who questions the veracity of historical accounts of the Holocaust. Buckner is displaying the neo-Nazi views of academy commandant Brack. Fortunately, General Teague has planted another spy, Luther, on campus, and Luther is posing as a groundskeeper. Karl can also rely on his old friend, Coach Devlin, to support his investigation. And Karl foolishly puts his trust in school nurse Jenny, who turns out to be Brack's girlfriend. Karl discovers that Brack's operation stretches beyond campus bigotry -- he has brainwashed a group of students into becoming an elite force known as the Werewolves. Attempts to connect the Werewolves to off-campus terrorism prove fruitless, even after a student saboteur dies in an explosion. Brack has the General killed and prepares to eliminate traitors to the cause, and Ted finally begins to question his place in Brack's crusade. Ted decides to help Karl, Devlin, and Luther bring Brack down.
