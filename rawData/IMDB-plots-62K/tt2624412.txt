A devoted husband in a marriage of convenience is forced to confront his secret life.
Nolan Mack is sixty, married, a literature professor, and well-regarded and leads a quiet uneventful. One night, as he drives home, he nearly runs into a hustler. Sorry for what might have happened, Nolan starts a conversation with the young man named Leo and ends up in a hotel room; not for sex - the older man has fallen in love with the young man. Having realised he was gay since age of twelve, Nolan's never been able to express his sexual orientation and Leo happens to crystallize his feelings and desires. But what extent will it affect his married life and professional career?
