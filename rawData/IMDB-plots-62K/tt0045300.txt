Jungle Jim helps an attractive research writer for the British museum clear up the mystery of a tiger cult in Africa while thwarting art thieves and bringing to justice a Nazi war criminal.
Jungle Jim is assigned to track down a former SS Officer, who alone knows the locale of an art collection stolen during World War II by the Nazis. There is also a trio of crooks who desire to know where the paintings are hidden. The SS Officer, fleeing U.S. Army agents, commandeers an airplane carrying night-club entertainer Phyllis Bruce and her trained tiger, who is also not exactly what she appears to be. The plane crashes in the jungle, where the local natives are voodoo tiger-worshipers, especially those who fly in on a great bird. Jungle Jim, aided by an American army officer, swings into action, and, after doing in a lion with is knife, tracks down the crooks, or what's left after the tiger-worshipers get through with them, and they themselves are killed in a dynamite blast.
