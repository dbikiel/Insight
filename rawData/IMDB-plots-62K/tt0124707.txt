A cautionary tale. At 17, Sherman Oaks high schooler Pam Banner has a baby out of wedlock. The baby is adopted, but Pam's too embarrassed to go back to school, so her dad gets her a job as the receptionist for a talent agent. A rock star takes her to a party, seduces and abandons her; that starts a spiral of partying, free love, and drug use. Pam becomes friends with Jeannie, a hooker who supports Jimmy, a useless druggie. Soon the three of them are living together, and Jimmy seems appealing to Pam. She's missing work more and more often, Jeannie wants out of the life, Jimmy is going through withdrawal, and Pam is in the middle of a maelstrom. Is there any exit for Pam?
What spoilers???I didn't give away the ending, which is the lamest part of the movie.
This classic takes us back to classic '70's Southern California trash/drug culture with such notable scenes as getting high on grass, stumbling on billboards high over the Sunset Strip, tripping-out, having bad trips watching planes take-off at LAX (you really don't have to be on LSD to experience this), and, like, wow, man I am getting REALLY stoned!!!Far Out!!!There's a big downer scene of watching opioid de-tox in jail, man. That just ain't righteous!!Extra special, ultra-gross-out STD promos included in the movie to promote a sexually- liberated, safe-and-clean, sex-filled life.teen-aged "Pam" has a cool '70 red/white Chevelle SS 396 ragtop to drive around Hollywood in.Her drink-a-martini Dad has an equally cool '70 Chrysler Imperial 4-door(okay, those are "spoilers")Notable cast member: porno-Queen-star, Liz Renay, gives her special interpretation to her role as a Sherman Oaks, California suburban-Mom, who find her teen-aged-daughter has contracted a sexually-transmitted disease (YOU LITTLE TRAMP!!! (smack! across the face)").
