A collection of alternate takes and deleted material from the Paul Thomas Anderson film Punch-Drunk Love (2002) are compiled and matched with the Jon Brion song "Here We Go" in this plot-less but very interesting short film. This short piece also features more Jeremy Blake artwork that was not included in the film.
