A touching story of honour, respect, and the way of the samurai, as interpreted by an unlikely hero, somewhere in the rocky mountains of Crete.
Kind-hearted Thomas, a thoughtful and temperate shepherd, lives with his caring mother, somewhere in the rocky and mountainous region of Crete. But, up there, in the profound alpine solitude--Thomas who feels a palpable longing for his long-lost father's presence, his stories of faraway lands, and the great warriors of bygone times such as the legendary Samurai--practices daily his combat skills and the code of bushido, the warrior's way. However, pretty soon, a chance encounter shall disrupt the fine balance of things, as an ongoing territorial dispute leads to a rapid escalation of violence, which, inevitably, has a life-altering and transformative conclusion. Will things ever be the same after that fateful event?
Thomas has always had a passion about Japanese warriors called Samurai. His uniqueness in a small community of a village in Crete causes conflict. The villagers' attitude towards him is not good and he's not going to stand and take it for much longer.
