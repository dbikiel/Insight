A group of young actors stay overnight in their host's castle only to be hunted by a serial killer.
A group of artists, composed of the young actors Wilfried and Matthieu and the actresses Sophie, Mathilde and the dumb Jeanne, is hired by a millionaire, Axel de Fersen, to present a performance of Little Red Riding Hood in his isolated castle to celebrate the birthday of his grandson. Meanwhile, the police advises that a serial killer is raping and killing young women in the woods around that area. During the night, the group feels trapped and threatened in the castle, guessing who is and where might be the killer.
A troupe of actors are hired to perform for a young boy's birthday at a remote mansion. The party goes well, except for some unusual behavior by the youngster and his grandfather, but then things take a turn for the worse when the police come by to warn everyone that a murderer is roaming loose in the area. The actors decide the safest thing to do is to stay in the mansion, but soon the bodies start piling up. Could the killer be the old man, the young boy, or one of the actors themselves?
