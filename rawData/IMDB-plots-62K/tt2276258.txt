vis-i-tant; n: A VISITOR, esp. one from the spirit world... Samantha plays the role of "Fortune Teller," but she is a thorough skeptic about "paranormal activities" and all things supernatural - she certainly doesn't believe in ghosts. But one night alone in her house, she is about to learn that there are dark forces that don't care whether she believes or not; they are REAL. Or are they?...
