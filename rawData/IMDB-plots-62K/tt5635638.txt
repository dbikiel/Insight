In 1980's Detroit, 17 year-old Richard Wershe, Jr. allegedly ran a sophisticated inner-city drug dealing operation. Now, journalists, police, federal agents and hit men are speaking for the first time about the legend of "White Boy Rick."
Now the subject of 1980's Detroit street folklore, then 17 year old Richard Wershe, Jr. was said to have run a vicious, sophisticated large-scale inner-city drug operation. He was arrested as a teen and sentenced to life-without parole for a non-violent, juvenile drug offense. He remains imprisoned 30 years later. Now, journalists, police, federal agents and hit men seek to set the record straight on the urban legend known as "White Boy Rick." In this case the truth is even stranger than the legend.
