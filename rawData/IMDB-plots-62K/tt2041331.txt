Jill's an artist. Adam's a filmmaker. And their love life is off the chain. There's no experience too wild, no dare too dangerous -- not even when Jill lets Adam strap her to a gurney in the abandoned hospital they're scoping out for their next art show. But he shouldn't have left her alone. Not even as a joke. Now, Jill's hookup with horror has awakened something in that place. Something with a lust for more than flesh.
