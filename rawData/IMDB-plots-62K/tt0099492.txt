The tenants of a rundown building on the outskirts of Tehran with no legal heir face major housing problems to deal with: major repairs and threat of eviction by greedy building manager who wants to own the building.
Set almost entirely in a residential building on the outskirts of Tehran, a number of tenants encounter a series of problems with their homes. The owner of the building Abbas, however, is careless, refusing to maintain the property. What begins as a few leaks and cracks here and there escalates into a matter of life and death as the tenants struggle to deal with setback after setback. Things are complicated further by a dispute regarding the building's heir, engineered in part by the conniving Quolam. A dramatic portrayal of domestic chaos.
