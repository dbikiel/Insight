Philippe and Daniel go on vacation to southeast Asia, where they meet Hans, a resident of the area who acts as their patron and guide. Before they leave to return to Paris, the two present Hans with a gift of their leftover native hashish. A year and a half later, an Amnesty International lawyer shows up and informs them that Hans was arrested and imprisoned for drug possession shortly after their departure, and is now condemned to death. Philippe and Daniel have an opportunity to help Hans by confessing their deed to the authorities, sharing blame for the crime and accepting prison terms. Additional pressure is applied by Hans' former girlfriend, the argument being that the life at stake is Hans'. Phillipe and Daniel maintain that their lives are at stake as well.
