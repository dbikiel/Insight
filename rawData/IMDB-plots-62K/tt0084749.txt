A mercenary with a three-bladed sword rediscovers his royal heritage's dangerous future when he is recruited to help a princess foil the designs of a brutal tyrant and a powerful sorcerer in conquering a land.
In a dark epoch of sorcery, the murderous megalomaniac, King Titus Cromwell, awakens the demonic necromancer, Xusia of Delos, to usurp the throne of the benevolent King Richard of Eh-Dan, enslaving his daughter, and forcing into exile his youngest son, Talon. One violent decade later, Talon--now a great warrior wielding a magnificent triple-bladed sword--returns hell-bent on revenge, unbeknownst to him, however, that the evil sorcerer is alive, gathering his strength for the ultimate battle. Will the dauntless adventurer restore peace to the long-suffering kingdom? Is this the return of the lost prince?
