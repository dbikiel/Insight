Eager for a job, journalist Adam White accepts the lowly position of columnist for the advice-giving section of the Chronicle but he often clashes with his cynical editor, Shrike.
Eager to land a journalistic position, Adam White goes to work as an advice-giving newspaper columnist. His editor, Shrike, takes pleasure in browbeating his alcoholic wife Florence for her past adultery, and assigning his employees journalistic jobs for which they have little aptitude or interest. Shrike goads Adam into meeting one of his correspondents, Fay Doyle, a teary, self-pitying woman who makes a play for him. Adam is torn between his loyalty to the newspaper and his girl Justy.
Young and conscientious Adam White has aspirations to write for the Chronicle newspaper. He gets his wish after meeting the newspaper's editor Bill Shrike, who offers Adam a position. It's not quite what Adam had envisioned as he is given the assignment of writing the 6 day per week, 1,000 words per edition Miss Lonelyhearts advice column. Bill has ulterior motives for offering Adam this job which concerns in part Bill's unhappy wife, Florence. Initially, Adam treats the assignment with disdain until he starts reading the sound of desperation in some of the incoming letters. Wanting to do right by those letter writers takes its toll on Adam, and in turn on his relationship with his girlfriend, Justy Sargeant. Bill, who wants Adam to write a more entertaining column, suggests that Adam actually meet one of the letter writers so that he can get a better perspective on the job. After meeting with Fay Doyle, one of those letter writers, and coming to understand her true story compared to what she actually wrote, Adam reflects further on the job, especially in relation to what he considers his dark past which he is trying to hide from Justy and himself.
