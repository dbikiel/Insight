A groundbreaking popular science fiction film about the past and future of astronautics, from the first experiments by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky to the manned spaceflight and colonization of the Moon.
Released one month after the launch of Sputnik 1, Klushantsev's trailblazing visualisation of the past, present and imagined future of the Soviet space programme became electrifying propaganda when a clip was shown by Walter Cronkite on the CBS Evening News.
