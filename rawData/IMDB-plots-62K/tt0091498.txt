A married French woman takes a zoo chimp named Max to be her lover.
Peter is a British diplomat in Paris. He is told by a detective that his wife, Margaret, has rented a flat where she spends quite a few hours monkeying around with a lover - a chimpanzee called Max. The relationship is serious, heartfelt, and sexual, so Peter invites the chimp to live with them.
