From the Sumitomo Corporation website"HAYABUSA: The Long Voyage Home" a film in whose production Sumitomo Corporation participated, premiered on January 19 at United Cinemas Toyosu, one of the theaters operated by United Cinemas Co., Ltd., a Sumitomo Corporation subsidiary. The film was previewed on all 12 of United Cinema Toyosu's screens by about 2,500 audience members. During the stage greeting, held in front of one of the largest screens in Japan, a Megastar Super Planetarium system replicated a view of outer space by extending a star-filled sky over the entire theater. * Based on the true story of the Hayabusa asteroid probe, which collected samples from the asteroid Itokawa in the world's first-ever sample return after landing on a solid-surfaced celestial body outside Earth's gravisphere, the film depicts the Japanese scientists and engineers of Team Hayabusa facing up to the numerous desperate challenges that arose during the probe's 7-year, 6-billion-kilometer voyage through space. * Several of the actors appearing in the film - Watanabe Ken, Eguchi Yosuke, Natsukawa Yui, Ozawa Yukiyoshi, Nakamura Yuri, and Fuji Tatsuya - took the stage during the stage greeting along with director Takimoto Tomoyuki, musical producer Tsujii Nobuyuki, and JAXA professor Kawaguchi Junichiro. Given his first shot at overseeing the entire score for a film, Tsujii remarked with a happy smile, "It was hard work creating the image of outer space, but I was very fortunate to be able to work with such an enthusiastic director." Watanabe, one of the film's stars, wrapped up with this comment: "We present a capsule holding our thoughts and feelings in the hopes that as many people as possible will see the film and gain a peek inside the capsule." *
