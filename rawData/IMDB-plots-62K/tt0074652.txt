A young gynecologist can't figure out whether to get serious with a young nurse or to stay casual with his married lover. Things get complicated when both women don't want to play his game anymore.
Doctor John, who works in a Prague maternity hospital while still living at home with his mother, is a self-assured philanderer who seduces a young nurse, Anna, and makes her pregnant. All the while he has two other girlfriends on the go, a flighty young hippy who lives with her boyfriend, and the slightly older wife of his doctor colleague who discovers their liaison and is not best pleased. Doctor John can't decide which of the women he prefers, and the ensuing anxiety causes him to mess up his medical research to the point where his professor boss sacks him. John then goes in search of Anna (who has resigned her job and left Prague) to persuade her that she's the one, and he tracks her down to a maternity home in the countryside. She turns him down.
