After she quits her lucrative job, Olivia finds herself unsure about her future and her relationships with her successful and wealthy friends.
Four women friends: three are wealthy and married plus there's Olivia, a former teacher who's now a maid. The marriages are in various states of health: Franny and Matt are happy and very rich. Christine and David write screenplays together, are remodeling their house, and argue. Jane is angry all the time and Aaron, who's an attentive husband, strikes everyone as gay. Franny sets up Olivia with a friend of hers, Mike, a personal trainer, and Olivia takes him with her to a couple of housecleaning jobs. A benefit dinner for ALS, an awkward guy named Marty whose place Olivia cleans, and a French maid's outfit figure in the story. Is there more to life than its problems?
The story of four best friends whose comfortable lives are thrown off balance as the realities of early middle age set in. It paints a painfully hillarious portrait of modern life in theclass sensitive west side of Los Angeles.
