A young woman dreams of becoming a race-car driver, even though the career claimed the life of her father.
Car racer -like his father- Ray Johnstone has a fatal track accident. His brother Bill, the track boss, also becomes the guardian of Ray's brat daughter Alex, who grew up around the pits and dreams of following in his footsteps in his race car, provided she and pre-teen Casey can repair his car. That fails for years, but when professional racer Darryl K. Sands meets and gets a crush on her, he finds the fault and gives her invaluable lessons. Bill however isn't inclined to grant her pro-license, unlike cocky local Danny 'Ace' Lorimer, knowing she's mentally unfit, yet ends up giving her a long-shot, which she seems to mess up completely.
