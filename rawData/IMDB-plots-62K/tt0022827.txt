A wisecracking New York reporter intrudes on a research scientist's quest to unmask The Moon Killer.
A monster lurks as New York newspaperman Lee Taylor investigates one of the "Moon Killer" murders, in which the victims are strangled, cannibalized and surgically incised under the light of the full moon. The trail leads to the cliffside mansion of Dr. Xavier, where the doctor and his colleagues conduct a strange experiment.
The New York newspapers have dubbed him "The Moon Killer." He stalks the streets at night, strangling and cannibalizing men and women, young and old. There have been six victims so far, and the police believe that a scientist at the Academy of Surgical Research is responsible. Is it Dr. Wells, with the missing left hand, who studied cannibals in Africa? Is it Dr. Haines, who looks at erotic magazines and once may have cannibalized a fellow while adrift at sea? Is it Dr. Rowitz, who analyzes moon rays and writes poetry? Is it Dr. Duke, an obstreperous paralytic? Or is it Dr. Xavier, a.k.a. Dr. X, who runs the academy? Dr. X's young and lovely daughter will be instrumental in solving the crime, as will the hysterical maid and the sinister butler. Our trip through this morbid tale is guided by the wisecracking reporter who will find himself toe-tagged, gassed, tossed around and generally manhandled before the mystery is solved.
