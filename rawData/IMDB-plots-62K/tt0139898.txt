Brett Sprague is a violent and psychopathic man, who is released on parole after serving a sentence for assault. As he returns to his family house and we watch him and his brothers, Stevie and Glenn, for the next 24 hours, it becomes clear this day will not end well.
A chilling film rife with domestic violence features Brett Sprague (David Wenham), a man on parole whose thin veil of humanity becomes evident within hours of moving back in with his girlfriend, two brothers, and mom. Manipulating and intimidating everyone in the household as the mother fails to keep together the family in Brett's wake, the family becomes beset with Brett's omnipotent presence evidenced in the following quote from the end of the film: "We're all gods in our own world". The beginning of the film features eerie piano music from The Necks while showing still images of everyday household objects, illustrating how the ordinary can take on meaning often larger than itself and providing escape for the inhabitants of this household run by a sociopath.
