A real-estate developer buys an antique brass bottle that contains an ancient genie who's determined to fulfill his new master's every wish.
After being released from his bottle by Harold Ventimore, the genie Fakrash commits himself to improving his new master's life. The only problem is that instead of helping Harold, Fakrash tends to get his master into more predicaments than he gets him out of.
