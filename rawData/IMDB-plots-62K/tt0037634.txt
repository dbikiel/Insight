After surviving a plane crash, a couple tries to find out why one of the passengers was carrying four wills for a million dollars, with each one naming him as the beneficiary.
Among the few survivors of a plane crash in the Mexican wilderness are elderly Albert Richard Kingby, and married couple Carola and Clyde Ballister. With an unscrupulous streak, Carola and Clyde, seeing a briefcase handcuffed to Kingby's person, are able to open the briefcase when Kingby is unconscious to discover four wills for four different people, each will listing Kingby as the sole beneficiary each of $1 million. The Ballisters believe that in locating the four people - who are located in four different cities in the US northeast - and following Kingby, they may be able to get that $4 million for themselves. Jeff Caighn, unscrupulous himself, is the lawyer for one of the four, Miles Kempen of Cleveland, he who, seemingly afraid of Kingby, asks Jeff to draft a new will immediately leaving the $1 million solely to who is to be his wife, club singer Lili Roegan. The Ballisters and Jeff's stories intersect as a result, Carola and Jeff who enter into a partnership for that $4 million in believing that they can squeeze Kingby and/or the four in whatever is assumed to be Kingby's illegal plot. Although Jeff and Carola have this partnership, they may still be working in their own individual self-interest in getting the $4 million solely for him or herself in sacrificing the other. They are aware that Kingby is willing to kill to reach his end goal, but when they discover what that end goal is, Jeff and Carola may look at what they're doing in a slightly different light.
