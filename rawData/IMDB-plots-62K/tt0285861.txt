A bank manager with: (a) a gambling problem and (b) access to a multimillion dollar account gets into a messy situation. Based on the story of the largest one-man bank fraud in Canadian history.
Dan Mahowny (Philip Seymour Hoffman) was a rising star at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. At twenty-four, he was Assistant Manager of a major branch in the heart of Toronto's financial district. To his colleagues, he was a workaholic. To his customers, he was astute, decisive, and helpful. To his friends, he was a quiet, but humorous man who enjoyed watching sports on television. To his girlfriend, he was shy but engaging. None of them knew the other side of Dan Mahowny, the side that executed the largest single-handed bank fraud in Canadian history, grossing over ten million dollars in eighteen months to feed his gambling obsession.
Based on the true story of a Toronto Bank Manager, Dan Mahowny (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is addicted to gambling. Horses and sports are only a few of his interests. Eventually, he creates dummy accounts at his bank and uses that money to fly to Atlantic City to gamble. He seems to get little joy from winning, and his addiction is such that he is unable to stop in any event. Even if he wins huge amounts, which he does, he simply continues to play until he has lost it all. It's a frighteningly lonely experience that cannot include friends or anyone else around him. In the end, his hours and hours at the tables give him nothing, and as his embezzlement catches up to him, he is arrested and sent to jail.
