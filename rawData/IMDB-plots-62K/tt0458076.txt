Lucía, an active little girl, looses a tooth. Santiago, her father, is an out-of-work boss, and her mother, Pilar, is a successful but overworked architect, reassure Lucía, by telling her that the Hairy Tooth Fairy (a mouse named Pérez) will come to her bedroom to collect her tooth, leaving some money in its place. A mouse who had been monitoring the situation tells another mouse, who in turn tells another mouse until finally the news reaches Pérez, The Hairy Tooth Fairy, who lives in a boat in the port along with hundreds of other mice. They receive the teeth that he collects, and then clean, shape and polish them so that they can be transformed into shiny round pearls. These pearls are then carried through the citys sewers until finally they reach the jewellers owned by Morientes, where an old friend exchanges them for their weight in gold. What would normally be a routine trip for the legendary rodent takes an unexpected turn for the worse when heartless, malicious scoundrels kidnap Pérez to take his boat and his fortune for themselves. Lucía, with the help of her cousin Ramiro, disobeys her parents and sets out to rescue Pérez, thus beginning a fascinating adventure with an outcome that just goes to show that you dont have to be a child to believe.
