An ex-model gets caught up in lust, murder and betrayal when a gun-wielding man pays her a visit.
Emy is a beautiful woman who was a professional model. She has been married to Max, a successful businessman, with whom she lives in Los Angeles. But he always travels for business and during one of his many business trips, while alone in the house, she is withheld by a criminal named Roy. Roy has also kidnapped Francesca, Emy's sister, and keeps her another place. In order to free her, he asks a huge sum of money in return from the protagonist. But she is also in the game. While staying in the villa, the maniac Roy entertains sexual relations with Emy, with a friend of hers named Dana. But the real "hyena" of the film is Angela, Roy's girlfriend and Max's lover, who does not expect anything else other than Roy to raise the money to be able to take them and enjoy them all for himself. In fact, once you get the money from Emy, Roy kills both sisters but in turn will be taken out of his girlfriend, who will flee with the briefcase full of dollars in a car.
