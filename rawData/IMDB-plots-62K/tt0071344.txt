An air hostess gets involved in Naples, against her will, in the in-fighting amongst rival gangs.
Nora is a stewardess for ATI Airlines. She lands in Naples: a stranger gives her $100 to deliver a letter to Silvera, a brawny thug who has his boys work her over, convinced she's in league with "Il Americano," a mysterious underworld figure. Manuel, a young boxer, helps Nora get to her hotel and convinces her to seek police help. Wherever she goes, three rival gangs may be following her: Silvera's men, a gang led by a guy in a priest's cassock, and a smooth operator who gives Nora a consultant fee for information. Drugs may be behind the machinations. Is Nora more than an innocent bystander? A fistfight and a car chase bring matters to a head. What about Manuel?
