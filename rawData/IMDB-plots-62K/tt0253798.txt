A snowboarder's plans for his own snowboard park go awry when an ex-girlfriend returns to town.
Bull Mountain, Alaska, is a no frills ski resort, and the staff is a bunch of partying snowboard bums. The late founder, Papa Muntz, was famed for skiing with his butt exposed, and in fact is so memorialized by a statue. But his son, Ted, plans to sell the resort to hotshot ski mogul John Majors, who starts turning it into a slick resort, which of course has no room for most of the staff. The exception is Rick, the most serious of the bunch. But there's a complication: Rick met Majors' stepdaughter Anna on vacation in Mexico, and he's never gotten over a crush he had on her, even though she's about to marry a great guy, and Rick is also fiercely loyal to his friends.
Rick is the leader of a group of prankster snowboard employees at Bull Mountain, Alaska whose lives change for the better or worse when a hotshot land developer, named John Majors, arrives with the intent to buy out the owner, Ted Muntz, and turn Bull Mountain into a money laundering, tourist theme ski park while Rick deals with Majors' stepdaughter Anna, who was the former love of his life and who abandoned him some years back, Casablanca style.
Animal House meets Casablanca in this outrageous snowboarding comedy. Rick Rambis and his friends are having the times of their lives on Bull Mountain until the legendary Papa Muntz's son decides to sell the mountain to sleazy land developer John Majors, having the staff fired and turning Bull Mountain into "Yuppieville".
