A review of the wild New York City nightlife of the 90s. The cast of characters who made up the infamous Club Kids speak candidly about that era, culminating with Alig's release from incarceration.
New York City. 1987. A new group of individuals arrives to fill the artistic power vacuum created by Andy Warhol's untimely death and the demise of his "Factory", in the form of The Club Kids. They would reign supreme over The City's nightlife through an era of decadence, debauchery and creative heights, which culminated with the death of one of them as well as the party itself. Their undisputed leader was Michael Alig, who came to New York with dreams of working in the fashion industry, only to find himself at the head of a nightlife movement which went far beyond anyone's expectations, reaching outrageous proportions. It ultimately imploded catastrophically with Michael going to prison for the murder and dismemberment of fellow Club Kid and drug dealer Angel Melendez. This coincided with the death of the NYC Super-Club era.
With Alig's impending release from prison
we interview him as well as the cast of characters who
made up the infamous Club Kids. We go down memory
lane to a now-forgotten decadent New York and emerge
with Michael from prison as a bookend to a well documented
case. This documentary will focus on his arc as a human
being (i.e. the difference between the kid who went in vs. the man who
ultimately emerges). Hes been in a time capsule since 1996.
The subtext will chronicle the decline of the Club Kids movement and subsequent collapse of Peter Gatien's empire. The end of an era, reflecting Aligs downfall as an individual.
