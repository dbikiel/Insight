The aquatic adventure of the highly influential and fearlessly ambitious pioneer, innovator, filmmaker, researcher, and conservationist, Jacques-Yves Cousteau, covers roughly thirty years of an inarguably rich in achievements life.
From 1949 to 1979, thirty years in the life of captain Jacques-Yves Cousteau, the famous researcher, scientist, inventor, filmmaker whose greatest achievement is to have made the general public more curious - and accordingly closer - to the sea. A genius, a leader of men and a charismatic opinion maker, Cousteau was not without defects, his being unfaithful to ever-supportive wife Simone for example or else his vainglory..., but let him who is without sin cast the first stone. The spectator leaves Cousteau in mid-1979 at the worst time of his life: his favorite son, Philippe, has just died in the crash of a plane he was piloting. The dashing conqueror of the sea has suddenly become a broken old man, tempted to discouragement but his eldest son Jean-Michel is by his side to help him overcome his grief and go on with his mission...
In 1949, the eccentric naval officer who wanted to be a pilot, Jacques-Yves Cousteau, quits the Navy to explore and document the undiscovered blue world that surrounds us. With the iconic Calypso--the 1941 minesweeper--and his hand-picked crew, Cousteau's aquatic adventure covers roughly thirty years of an inarguably rich in achievements life: from the invention of the autonomous regulator to his romantic views of colonising the sea. However, although he was a highly influential and fearlessly ambitious man, the French pioneer was also a mortal--an imperfect human being blemished by his disloyalty to his caring wife, Simone, and the constant conflicts with his younger son, Philippe. But, above all, Cousteau was the man who brought the hidden wonders of the sea into our living rooms, and the one who raised awareness of the imperative need to protect the nature--a never-ending effort that kept on long after Philippe's sudden death, on 28 June 1979.
