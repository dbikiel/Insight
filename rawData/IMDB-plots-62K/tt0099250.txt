In World War II London, Karl Hulten is an American serviceman and Betty Jones is an aspiring showgirl. When they meet, passion and desire fuel a dangerous fantasy: he is the big-time gangster named Chicago Joe; she is his glamorous moll. They go for a reckless drive, they steal a fur coat, each time she dares him to take a wilder risk, and each time he proves himself. Until their lust for excitement demands nothing short of going "all the way" - to murder.
