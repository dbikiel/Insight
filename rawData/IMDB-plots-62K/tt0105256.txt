Charleston, South Carolina. The Odoms have lived a life of the traditions of the American south in their longtime, large family beach front home. That tradition is turned upside down when younger daughter, bright high school senior Lucille Odom, arrives home to find a note from her mother, Helen Odom, that note which states that she has left for good. This move has been a long time coming for Helen, although the actual act was somewhat spontaneous based on evidence around the family home. The family patriarch, retired Warren Odom, believes his wife will eventually return. To help with the situation, Warren and Lucille request the return of Warren's eldest daughter/Lucille's older sister, Rae Odom. However, Rae has her own issues as she arrives with her new Yankee husband, Billy McQueen, and news that they got married because she's pregnant, about which she doesn't seem too happy. These goings-on affect impressionable Lucille the most, she who is trying to find her own way in life and love. But as each of the individual adult family members deal with their immediate situations - for Warren which includes if there is a second chance on love, most specifically with hairdresser Vera Delmage - Lucille may come to an understanding of her past and future.
The life of a teenager, in her last year of high school in Charleston, South Carolina, is upended when her mother leaves her father and cuts all contact with her family. Things get even more complicated when her older sister shows up with a new husband and a pregnancy she's bitter and ambivalent about, and moves back in. They all spend the rest of the summer trying to come to grips with their lives.
