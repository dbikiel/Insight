A sepia tinted weepie where a niave girl learns about men in more ways than one; a loss of innocence - but full of charm
Cassie has a miserable job in a bar, is lonely and depressed. Her boyfriend left her when she told him that she's pregnant. After several failed suicide attempts, she'd given away her baby for adoption, and regrets it now. When a theater group from Los Angeles comes to the small town of Buckeye, she meets stage technician Riley. Discreetly he starts wooing her. She likes him very much, but still has feelings for her former boyfriend Billy, too.
Small town girl meets small town boy and discovers that love has many shades. Woman director when there weren't many around and one of the best films of 1986; released alongside Desperately Seeking Susan as one for the girls and not for the boys who were all into spaceships and stuff like that.
