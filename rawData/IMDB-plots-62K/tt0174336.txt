Three egotistical swingers, who think they're God's gift to women, end up having their friendships tested when all three of them pick up and start dating the same woman.
In New York, Brad, Zeke and Jonathan are wolves and best friends. They meet each other once a week together with their married friend Eric to tell theirs dates, affairs and sex experiences along the week. Brad and Zeke are greater lovers and Jonathan loves to self-masturbate. One day, each one of them discloses to the others that has met the perfect girlfriend. Indeed, they discover that their girlfriends is the same woman called Mia. Their dispute for Mia will affect their friendship.
Set in New York, 'Whipped' is about a group of three single men, buddies from college, whom meet every Sunday at their local diner hangout to discuss their favorite sport: scoring with women. Their conversations (always revealing, sometimes revolting, and occasionally riotous) revolve around the weekend past and the girls that these three egotistical and narcissistic swingers were able or unable to "scam." However, when all three single guys unknowingly go after the same "perfect" woman, Mia (Amanda Peet), they begin to question their skirt-chasing ways. Squabbling breaks out amongst the group as they compete for her attention and suddenly, the fate of their ritual and their friendships, becomes uncertain. Who will win the morning round table bragging rights? You'll be surprised.
