Cantinflas works as a model of tuxedos for a prestigious store. He just has to wander around in the streets, wearing the tuxedo and a big ad, put on his back. The tuxedo allows him to access to exclusive places, where he meets important and rich people. During his free time, Cantinflas is the manager of an amateur boxer, assists an attractive nurser and occasionally helps a priest in the church and running a poor orphanage. However, one day Cantinflas, wearing the tuxedo, meets a rich man, whom falsely believes that our friend is also a millionaire.
