A hunt for a spy, in an hotel in the South of France just before World War Two.
An Austrian medical student living and working in France is hauled in by the police while on holiday in the south of the country. Accused of espionage he is sent back to his hotel to find out who might really be the spy. Not only his freedom but his chance of becoming a French citizen rests on what he can uncover.
In 1938, medical student Peter Vadassy, an Austrian national, is vacationing at the Hotel Reserve along the French Riviera. Half French, Vadassy has been living in France for the past five years because of the Nazi invasion of Austria. He hopes of becoming a naturalized French citizen, the completion of that process which is imminent. Because of some photographs on the film in his camera, Vadassy is questioned by the French police on the suspicion of being a Nazi spy. In reality, the police know that Vadassy is innocent of these charges, and that someone switched cameras with him. That someone is currently staying or working at the Hotel Reserve. The police are not averse to using Vadassy as a scapegoat for what has happened and deport him back to Nazi occupied Austria following his certain imprisonment. They leave it up to Vadassy to figure out who the Nazi spy is in an effort to clear his name.
