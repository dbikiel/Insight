Traveling salesman Tony Roozen and his newest gadget, Porky (a robotic pig) end up stranded in the tiny hamlet of Madonna where deep and lasting political conflicts have disrupted village life. Tony can't wait to leave this godforsaken place but the young village teacher Maria Glorie needs his help. Who knows, maybe Porky can lend a hand?
Cocky traveling salesman Tony Roozen grudgingly postpones the weekend in the Ardennes with his girl's parents during which he planned to propose. His boss launched a competition for double pay or the sack in the launch of the revolutionary pheromones-dispensing robot pig 'Porky' to boosts porcine farm fertility.He draws the backward Westhoek region, and driving at night crashes in a ditch in godforsaken, yet Holy Virgin-obsessed peasant hamlet Madonna. The rustics are engaged in a bitter referendum campaign whether to accept or oppose a new road and thereto relocate the Madonna statue. Tony can only statue in the only room in single class-teacher Maria's horrible inn, and finds in-living grandmother Gusta's World war I fianc√© Prosper's ghost as bothersome as the locals morbid attachment to war ammunition and soldier remains in the fields.
