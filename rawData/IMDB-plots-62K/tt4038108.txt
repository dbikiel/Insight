A modern tragedy about a group of 14-year-old schoolchildren whose daily life is shaped by the power of social media and ever increasing sexualisation through the Internet.
A group of normal 14-year-old teenagers at a secondary school in ZÃ¼rich with the normal yearnings for love and acceptance. But the power of social media, with its high-gloss selfies and perpetual pressure towards cooler and sexier, increasingly forces the kids to deny their true feelings. So a tragedy runs its course, one in which it is almost impossible to differentiate between perpetrator and victim, guilt and innocence.
The story follows a group of Swiss boys and girls in their mid-teens. They all go to the same high school in Zurich and seem like your everyday sorts of teenagers. However, their outlook is largely shaped by external influences and vices, eg porn, drugs, social media, peer pressure. This leads to some dramatic actions and consequences.
