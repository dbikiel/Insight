Divorcing Chicago parents send their only son to live with his aunt in Los Angeles for the summer, where he befriends a local, learns to surf, gets a girlfriend, and witnesses a murder.
Tom moves to California to his aunt's house. There he meets Fin, who teaches him how to surf and be just a regular "California kid." This movie follows the book "Tom Sawyer." They even have to catch a character like Injun Joe.
