Bugs plays every defensive position against the Gashouse Gorillas.
At a baseball game between the Gashouse Gorillas and the Tea-Totallers, a heckling Bugs Bunny is forced to play all positions against the brutish Gorillas. Naturally, their muscle is no match for Bugs' wit and pitching skill.
Bugs Bunny comes out of his rabbit hole in the outfield in the middle of a baseball game between the Gas-House Gorillas and the Tea-Totallers. He soon finds himself playing all positions against the Gorillas. He befuddles them with his slow ball, a picture of a beautiful girl and actually wins an argument with an umpire. It's the bottom of the 9th and when a ball is hit out of the park, Bugs races all the way to the Umpire State Building to make the catch.
The Gashouse Gorillas aren't taking their ball game very seriously. And who can blame the cigar-chomping ruffians when the opposing team is the Tea-Totallers, composed of 93-and-1/2-year-old men? The crowd wildly cheers every point the Gorillas score, but there is one naysayer: Bugs Bunny, who boos them lustily in between bites of his hot-dog-bun-covered carrot. The Gorillas unexpectedly call his bluff when he shouts that he could take them on all by himself. Now Bugs is pitcher, catcher, left field, right field and every other position. He is outnumbered and seems outmatched, especially since the Gorillas have so many dirty tricks up their soiled sleeves. But Bugs has more tricks than all of them put together.
