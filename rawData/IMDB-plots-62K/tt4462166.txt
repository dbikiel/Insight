For over 40 years The Drew League has been a fixture in LA's basketball history - a rite of passage for both local players and pros from around the world. A place where steel sharpens steel and rival gang members disarm to watch the NBA's best right on their turf. At the heart of it all is Dino Smiley. A ball boy turned commissioner. A family man and pillar in the community who has used the league as a means to provide family and opportunity in an area where even life is uncertain. Welcome to The Drew, where the motto is No Excuse, Just Produce.
If you come from a neighborhood that you love and believe in the power and pride of the Village, you have got to watch this film. I grew up on 118th and Willowbrook and I grew up before the Watts rebellion, before there was a King Drew hospital, etc. But it was always a place where people looked out for you. It was a community that cared and after the stigma of the rebellion, gang violence and drugs, brought there from outsiders, folks looked down on our Village. This is the documented story about those who stayed and lifted us up as our Village always has! Young brothers and sisters found a place to commune, to develop our skills, to mold athletic super stars, to inspire generations! By us, for us! In spite of! We still are The Village!
