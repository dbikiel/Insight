Harry is a young millionaire on holiday; he takes his yacht to a Greek island, and stays in the mansion of his friend, Count Orloff. The Count organizes a feast there, for three days and three nights, which is the reenactment of the love cult of the Goddess Aphrodite. Harry will meet Pauline there, a young woman who becomes his goddess... (Loosely based on Pierre Lou√Øs's novel, "Aphrodite".)
