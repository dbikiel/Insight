When a sudden illness and an unexpected reunion threaten dutiful housewife Elena's potential inheritance, she must hatch a desperate plan ...
Elena and Vladimir are an older couple, they come from different backgrounds. Vladimir is a wealthy and cold man, Elena comes from a modest milieu and is a docile wife. They have met late in life and each one has children from previous marriages. Elena's son is unemployed, unable to support his own family and he is constantly asking Elena for money. Vladimir's daughter is a careless young woman who has a distant relationship with her father. A heart attack puts Vladimir in hospital, where he realizes that his remaining time is limited. A brief but somehow tender reunion with his daughter leads him to make an important decision: she will be the only heiress of his wealth. Back home he announces it to Elena. Her hopes to financially help her son suddenly vanish. The shy and submissive housewife then comes up with a plan to give her son and grandchildren a real chance in life.
Elena, a proletarian middle-aged former nurse, sees her social status ameliorate, after her marriage with the well-off and imperious older husband, Vladimir. Quiet and compliant to the point of submission, Elena will take care of her husband's every need, constantly having on her mind her unemployed slacker son, Sergei, while at the same time, Vladimir cares only for his purposeless daughter, Katya. As the awkward couple shares a loveless life in a luxurious and elegant flat on the outskirts of Kremlin, it is apparent that the ageing Vladimir's will shall put an end to Sergei's problems; however, when things don't go as planned, the once silent Elena will take action. In the end, how many more negotiations must there be to get a slice of happiness?
