The renovation of an old house in a village somewhere in Eastern Europe will bring the crew of an American home improvement TV show up against superstitions, misunderstandings and bloody violence.
When an American home improvement TV show visits a remote Eastern European village, the young crew thinks the lack of mocha latt√©s and free wifi will be the worst of their problems. But after their filming interrupts the superstitious villagers' private religious ritual, the situation takes a turn for the homicidal... and when the blood starts flowing, that's when things get really weird. With THEY'RE WATCHING, noted graphic novelists and animators Micah Wright and Jay Lender turn a classic horror premise upside down to create a fresh, funny, eye-popping twist on the genre.
Sent to a remote village somewhere in Eastern Europe for a home improvement reality show, the worldwide "Home Hunters Global", host Kate Banks along with a small TV crew return to check on the progress on Californian artist Becky Westlake's fixer-upper. But soon, the American crew will be in for a cultural shock of epic proportions, as the threatening natives and the village's recent history of witch-burning will bring them up against superstitions, misunderstandings and bloody violence. Is someone out there watching? They are.
