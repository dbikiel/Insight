Ben's an inexperienced criminal, who's attempt at robbing a small-town restaurant, quickly spirals out of control. Trapped inside with him is his girlfriend; Adie Graham, a clever sociopath who's the manager and masterminded of the theft in order to cover up evidence of her embezzlement. As Ben tries to keep her involvement a secret whilst negotiating with the police, Adie plays a fast and dirty game of deceit and manipulation, in order to come out on top - no matter who gets hurt.
