Two distraught mothers, whose children were gunned down in a drive-by, team up to avenge their deaths after local authorities fail to take action.
Lila, a grief-stricken mother reeling from her son's murder, attends a support group where she meets Eve, who urges her to take matters into her own hands to track down her son's killers. They soon embark on a journey of revenge, but also recovery.
Joins a battle of facing your child's death strongly. Lila befriends a newcomer at a weekly mother meeting for their dead children, called Eva. With strong opinions, this journey of grief is brilliant with twists and violence. Racial discrimination takes place, and shows local authorities may not pay attention towards certain cases. As this film carries on, you begin to ask yourself if Lila is really addressing the situation of her son, Stephon's death correctly- and more importantly- if she is really the weak woman the mother group suggest. As she finds out more about what her son used to get up to, does she really want her youngest son, Justin, to grow up in that environment? And does lila and eve causing more deaths really the answer? But also; is Eva ( J-Lo) really who she says she is?
