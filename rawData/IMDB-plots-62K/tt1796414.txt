An alien falls down from the sky in front of a wolf cub. His big ear allows him to listen to everything that happens in the universe. Yet somehow he fails to hear forest creatures calling for help.
The story of how an alien named Big Ear met and a wolf cub living in the forest. One night, the little wolf lay on its cot as usual and looked at the starry sky. He dreamed that at least one star fell in his forest too, and when that happened, he ran to look at it. It turned out that not a star had fallen from the sky, but a real alien. The alien decided to teach his new friend to listen to what is happening in the sky, but he heard only what is happening in his forest. While the little wolf helped the forest dwellers in trouble half the night, Big Ear listened to what was happening in space and did not even suspect that equally interesting things were happening right under his nose.
