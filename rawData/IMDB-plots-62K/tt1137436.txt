In the grim early years of Margaret Thatcher's premiership, also the crown years of hooliganism, the opportunities for thrill-seeking young men are what they've always been: sex, drugs, rock n' roll, fashion, football and fighting.
On the Wirral in the grim early years of Margaret Thatcher's premiership, the opportunities for thrill seeking young men looking to escape 9 to 5 drudgery are what they've always been: sex, drugs, rock n' roll, fashion, football and fighting.
Drama set in Birkenhead in 1979. Nicky Bell stars as 19-year-old Paul Carty, a bored, middle-class, junior civil servant who becomes involved in 'The Pack', a gang of 'casuals' who live for drugs, music, casual sex, football, fighting and, perhaps most importantly, fashion - specifically Fred Perry shirts, Lois jeans and Adidas Forest Hills trainers. As his intense relationship with fellow Pack member Elvis (Liam Boyle) begins to verge on the destructive, Paul finds himself plunged into a dark and violent world from which he cannot escape.
