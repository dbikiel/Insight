The 1956, a few years after the War of Independence and the establishment of the State of Israel. Immigration is at its peak, transit camps are scattered throughout the country. This is the story of one platoon at Training Base 4, a three-month boot camp boot comprised of conscripts from Ashkenazi Jews, new immigrants from North Africa and Europe, Holocaust survivors, as well as both secular and religious individuals. All the platoon members are physically unfit or mentally disabled. They find themselves on the extreme margins of society, at the bottom of the social ladder, and dream of ascending to the top. Common precepts such as "melting pot," "team spirit," and "one for all and all for one," remain unfulfilled. This is a battle for the individual's survival, a war for status, identity, and independence. A battle to attain the loftiest dreams, a war waged by individuals against their destiny.
