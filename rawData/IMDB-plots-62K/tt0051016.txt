The devil and the spirit of mankind argue as to whether or not humanity is ultimately good or evil.
The council of elders of outer space is deliberating on a very important subject: Must mankind be allowed to survive, or is it so esentially evil that it must be destroyed? A devil and an angel act as prosecutor and defense for the human race, and the movie presents in a very interesting way a series of episodes of the human history. What will be the final veredict? Innocent, or Guilty?
With man's invention of the 'Super H-Bomb', an other-worldly court sits in judgment as to whether mankind should be saved from itself or simply be destroyed by its own hand. Representing the argument in favor of destruction is Mr. Scratch, the Devil, while man is represented by the Spirit of Man. Before the court, they review past history with Mr. Scratch showing the evil side of mankind from Khufu, the Egyptian Pharaoh to Nero, Cleopatra, the bloody Crusades, the French Revolution and Adolf Hitler among others. The Spirit of Man responds with positive examples of man including Moses, Hippocrates, Sir Isaac Newton, William Shakespeare and Alexander Graham Bell to name but a few. With time ticking away, the judges must weigh the evidence and render their verdict.
