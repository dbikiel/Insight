Seattle veteran cop Richard Beck becomes a sexual assault victim and must deal with the painful aftermath.
Cop Beck thinks rape victims "bring it upon themselves" to be raped but has a mind-changing experience when he himself is raped by a couple of white trash felons, one of whom actually says he's going to make him "squeal like pig".
Made for TV Movie dealing with personal turmoil and emotional toll of being a sexual assault victim, only the victim isn't female, its an alpha male tough guy cop who's preconceived attitudes about rape victims are at odds both with his manor as a husband and parent but also the emotional trauma he suffers after the violent assault.
Richard Beck is a veteran Seattle cop with little sympathy for victims of sexual assault. Beck's world is turned upside down, however, when his loose-cannon tactics get him reassigned to the city's sex crimes department and result in his own rape at the hands of two surly thugs. After, with the help of rape counselor Barbara McKee, the formerly chauvinistic cop experiences a drastic change of heart on the issue, feeling compassion for the first time.
