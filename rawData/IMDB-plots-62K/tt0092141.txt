Mendou invites Ataru &amp; Co. to his estate for a viewing of a large, aging cherry tree named "Tarozakura", which is to be featured in an independent film which happens to be financed by Mendou, directed by Megane, and starring Lum. During filming, Ataru cuts down Tarozakura as called for in the script, but the downed tree starts foaming and disintegrates. Afterwards, bizarre incidents occur all over Tomobiki, a mountain emerges out of the ground, spring gives way to winter, Sakura's ghostly friends disappear, Lum begins losing her powers, and Lum's friends begin acting as though she doesn't exist.
