An international criminal with plans for world domination will stop at nothing to get his hands on a missing nuclear-weapon trigger. Will lethal Donna and her deadly sisters-in-arms manage to put an end to his lunacy?
A nuclear trigger is being smuggled to the mid east, and the "global balance of power is in jeopardy". A female federal agent goes undercover to steal it and ends up being murdered. 3 other busty federal agents, all former playboy playmates, along with their beefcake companions, have to save the day.
As the voluptuous Mika and the equally juicy Silk bathe under the Hawaiian sun aboard a luxurious yacht, the international criminal, Kane, receives a jade statuette of Buddha. With a nuclear-weapon trigger concealed inside the hollow figurine, this invaluable object is the means to Kane's success in his plans for world domination; however, someone double-crosses him and robs him of this quintessential part for his already-built weapon of mass destruction. In the meantime, back in Hawaii's KSXY radio station, the undercover agents, Ava and Edy, send encrypted orders from the head of the L.E.T.H.A.L. team, Lucas, to other fellow operatives, to stop Kane from retrieving his missing trigger at all costs. Now, the clock is ticking. Will Donna and her deadly sisters-in-arms manage to put an end to Kane's lunacy?
