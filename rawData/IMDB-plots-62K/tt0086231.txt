A classical dancer, Balakrishna, (Kamal Haasan) faces many struggles, but is eventually redeemed.
Balakrishna (Kamal) is an economically poor multi-talented dancer, adept at Bharata Natyam, Kathakali, Kuchipudi etc.. and his dream is to perform at an All-India level competition. Madhavi (Jayaprada), a rich girl notices his talent and helps in getting him an opportunity to perform in an all-India competition. As he is all set to relaise his dream, his ageing mother passes away which denies the fulfillment of his dream. Slowly, he gets closer to Madhavi and the day he wishes to propose to her, he realises that she is already married and her husband left her. Now the husband wants to re-unite with her which forces him to sacrifice his love. Years pass by and he turns into a drunkard. Meanwhile Madhavi loses her husband. She comes to know of Balakrishna who the doctors say is going to die soon. So she takes care of his medical needs and requests Balakrishna to teach dance to her daughter. The movie ends with Madhavi's daughter becoming a great dancer and the death of Balakrishna giving a message "There is no end to art".
