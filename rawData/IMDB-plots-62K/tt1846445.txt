The story happens in an old house in an old city of Iran. Because of the wedding of the youngest sister, Pasandide, all of her sisters come to their old house to help their mother.
Somewhere on the outskirts of modern Iran, at a traditional old house with a fragrant tree-shaded internal yard, a whole family is ceaselessly making nuptial preparations. Being the youngest in the family, the bright-eyed bride-to-be, Pasandideh, can't wait for the arrival of her older sisters; after all, her wedding with the grandson of a friendly family is a marvellous opportunity for a great reunion. Eventually, amid careful bridal arrangements, an unplanned but exciting treasure hunt, and thrilling ghost stories, everything will be soon ready for the joyous event; however, is a single cube of sugar enough to bring sweetness and happiness?
Pasandide is to marry an American man and join him in his native country. Pasandide's family comes together for the wedding ceremony at the home of Uncle Ezzatolah. The women cook and sew; the young children play hide-and-seek; one uncle looks for missing treasure in the garden. All is well in the run-up to the wedding ceremony. But before the ceremony that will unite Pasandide and her fianc√© in marriage gets underway, a single cube of sugar brings great misfortune to the family.
