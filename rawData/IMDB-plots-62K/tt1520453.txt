There are three women in the Langley household: Vivien, the mother, is caught between a fierce independence and an almost agoraphobic attachment to home; seductive and confident Mel is a 19 year-old mirror of her mother; Maura, 22, is alienated, afraid and unable to pinpoint her place in the world. They live together in a seemingly close household, yet each is very much alone. The family's status quo explodes when Jeff walks into their comfortable yet dysfunctional world. Bright, handsome, ambitious and sure of his future at 22, he's also socially awkward and a sexual novice who's been infatuated with Mel since high school. When they begin working together at the same restaurant, he jumps at the opportunity to finally start a romance with the free-spirited girl - but Mel has other ideas about their time together.
