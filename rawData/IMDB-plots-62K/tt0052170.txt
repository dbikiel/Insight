Off the Spanish coast, two tug-boat captains are caught in a violent feud over a woman but their rivalry is set aside when a sinking freighter carrying explosives must be salvaged and towed to port.
Captain Bellew commands a tugboat harbored off a Spanish village. The father of Josita, a village girl, tempts Bellew into a romantic interest in Josita, despite nearly five decades' difference in their ages, as he hopes the aging Bellew will not live long and will leave Josita well off. Meanwhile, Abel Hewson, a handsome English sailor, signs on to Bellew's crew. When Josita and Hewson fall in love, the stage is set for conflict. But greater conflict arises when a sinking freighter carrying explosive cargo has to be salvaged and towed to port.
