A sociopath on death row is given a chance to live if he agrees to take part in a chemical behavioral modification program.
Lee Ray Oliver grew up from abused kid to sociopath, inevitably condemned to death, but wakes up in the morgue after the 'lethal' injection. Dr. Michael Copeland offers him a choice: the real killer drug or 'volunteering' as life-long test person for his pharmaceutic experiment, Anagress, meant to suppress violent tendencies but side-effects unknown. After vicious escape attempts, Lee Ray finally develops genuine remorse and tries to make-up with Gary Caputo, who Lee shot in the head, leaving him mentally a child. Brother Bill Caputo's hate for ruining both of their lives is however redoubled, with tragic consequences.
