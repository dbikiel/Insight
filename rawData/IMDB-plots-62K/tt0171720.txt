A sorcerer tosses an iridescent little beetle into a flaming ceremonial cauldron, and much to his amazement, a six-winged fairy in the body of a beautiful young woman emerges. Is his sorcery potent enough to tame her?
Before an exquisitely ornate facade, an Egyptian sorcerer notices an iridescent little beetle creeping up the wall. Without delay, he plucks it off, and as a flaming ceremonial cauldron appears at his command, he tosses the insect into it which immediately bursts into flames. As a result, much to the wizard's amazement, this ritual transforms the beetle into a six-winged fairy in the body of a beautiful young woman, who now hovers effortlessly in mid-air. Delighted by the wondrous creature's fascinating and haunting repertoire, the awed conjurer will attempt to tame the magnificent being, but is his sorcery potent enough?
A conjurer with white beard and turban moves about in front of a building with an elaborate facade. He spies a golden beetle, about the size of a human infant, leaning against the wall. He snatches it up, conjures a fire, and tosses the beetle in. It escapes the fire in the form of a fairy, her six wings beating as she rises above the flames. The fairy, to the conjurer's consternation, has magical powers of her own. A fountain appears, first spraying water; then, things heat up for the turbaned villain.
