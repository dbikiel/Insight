Radio singer Joan Abbott, known as the "Crunchy-Wunchy Thrush", does not want to renew her contract with the cereal sponsor, as she wants to go to college. Her Uncle Willie signs it for her, however, as she is under age. Taking the name and credentials of Susie Smith, the secretary of her employer, Hartman, she disappears and enrolls at Rawley College. There she meets Buzz, leading a college band, and Scoop, running a college newspaper, who induces her to become a reporter. The Crunchy-Wunchy company institute a search for Joan via a publicity stunt, and Scoop assigns Joan to write an editorial against this kind of bad publicity. The Abernathy Products Company institutes a nation-wide contest to find the best college band, and Rawley College is entered, with Babs, the band's soloist, coached by Joan. Cynthia, girl friend of Buzz, is jealous of Joan, suspects she is the missing "Crunchy-Wunchy Thrush" and notifies Uncle Willie. The night of the nation-wide band-contest broadcast, Babs gets sick, Joan replaces her... and the Monogram musical formula-finale begins.
