A high caste Brahmin household adopts an orphaned lower caste girl, but when a young man from their caste wishes to marry her without knowing her lineage, caste differences flare up again.
Sujata gets adopted by the Chowdhury family, which consists of dad Upendranath; mom Charu; and a daughter, Rama, and is treated just like a daughter. Sujata grows up in this caring and nuturing household and leads a very comfortable life. Both Sujata and Rama are now of marriageable age. A young man, Adhir, comes to the Chowdhury household with a view to marry. He meets Sujata and falls in love with her. When he informs his aunt of this decision, she is aghast, as she knows that Sujata is not only of a lower caste but also an untouchable, and she wants Adhir to marry Rama, or will not permit him to live with her. While at the Chowdhury household, Charu wants Sujata to leave the house immediately, as she will have nothing to do with her anymore. Will Adhir and Sujata be ever married or will they be two more victims to the caste system?
