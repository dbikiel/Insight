The arrival of Anglo newcomers to an East L.A. Latino neighborhood rocks the quiet world of a handsome young local who is torn between the family restaurant and life as a big city chef.
East Side Story is the story of Diego (René Alvarado), a young, closeted Latino, who helps his grandmother (Irene DeBari) run the family restaurant while carrying on a relationship with equally closeted Pablo (David Berón). Diego has long felt trapped by the conservative culture of East LA and plans to move away and open an upscale restaurant, hopefully with his lover, but Pablo views their relationship very differently - a point driven home when he begins dating Diego's Aunt Bianca (Gladise Jimenez). At the same time, Wesley and his boyfriend move in, gentrifying the neighborhood. The attraction between Wesley and Diego is immediate and electric, forcing both men to reexamine their state of affairs.
In East Los Angeles, handsome, young Diego works at his family's restaurant while secretly having an affair with a hunky but super-closeted real estate agent, Pablo. For the largely Latino neighborhood, the landscape is literally changing as Anglo people move in, including gay couple Wesley and Jonathan. Diego, increasingly frustrated with his hush-hush situation with Pablo (who, making matters worse, romantically pursues a female relative of Diego's), falls for Wesley - but racist and homophobic friends and relatives of Diego while in Wesley's case, a pissy ex-boyfriend guarantee this spring affair will be no picnic. Almost a companion piece to "Quinceañera", director Carlos Portugal's "East Side Story" employs a perfect blend of humor, drama and soap opera-worthy plot twists in telling this very timely tale of a neighborhood - and some of its residents' lives - in flux.
