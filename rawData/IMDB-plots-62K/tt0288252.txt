A one-armed man obtains an artificial limb which he cannot control.
Indebted to the honest one-armed street beggar who returned his precious ring to him, a well-off gentleman decides to repay the favour by purchasing him a new mechanical wind-up arm. Without a doubt, this fully-functional artificial limb will change the poor vagabond's life for the better, nevertheless, even the most sophisticated machines are sometimes flawed.
A one-armed street peddler notices that a well-to-do man has dropped his ring, and the peddler returns it to him. The wealthy man is very grateful, and to show his appreciation he takes the peddler to a 'Limb Store', where he pays for a new arm to be attached where his own is missing. But the man soon finds out that his new arm seems to have a will of its own, as it does some things that cause him considerable embarrassment.
