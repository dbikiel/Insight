A member of the notorious Bloods since he was 12 years old - both in the film and in real life - Primo takes John, the son of his slain mentor, under his wing, versing him in the code of the streets. Set in East New York, FIVE STAR blends documentary and fictional storytelling as director Keith Miller carefully avoids worn clich√©s of gang culture to offer a compelling portrait of two men forced to confront the question of what it really means to be a man.
