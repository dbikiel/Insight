Alfred has always been down on his luck. An unlucky baby, he turns into... an unlucky child before metamorphosing into... an unlucky teenager! As an adult, he manages to become an architect but the buildings he designs invariably collapse. Fed up with such an ungrateful destiny, Alfred decides to throw himself into a canal. But for once being unlucky is a... stroke of luck, since he not only fails his suicide but he also meets Agathe, a beautiful TV host, who finds herself at the same place for the same reason. Instead of taking their own lives, the two young people save each other. Will love and luck be Alfred's new companion as of this moment?
