During the 1930s, in Marseilles, France, two small time crooks work for local crime bosses until they decide to go into business for themselves.
In 1930 Marseilles two small-time crooks join forces when they meet brawling over a woman. Starting with fixed horse races and fights, they start to find themselves doing jobs for the local gangster bosses. When they decide to go into the business for themselves, their easy-going approach to crime starts to change.
1930 Marseilles. Roch Sifreddi and François Capella are small time hoods, the former who has just been released from a four month stint in prison. Despite or because of their antagonistic initial meeting over a prostitute named Lola and their fundamental differences in personality - Sifreddi methodical and calculating, Capella more brusque and emotional, those emotions especially when it comes to women for who he has a weakness - they decide to enter into a partnership. Their work in fixing gambling, especially in things they can influence through bribes and the like, such as boxing matches or horse races, leads to some renown, and contract work for a percentage to maintain a stake in their work after it's done. That renown also leads to Sifreddi believing they can reach greater heights in the Marseilles crime world, initially something Capella is against. In going ahead, it means they have to deal with Mssrs. Poli and Marello, who control most of the crime in the city. Thus far, peace has largely been maintained in the equilibrium of Poli and Marello not stepping on each other's territory, and no one daring to go against them. They are advised against proceeding by Maître Rinaldi, a high-powered lawyer with political aspirations, who, in his association with them, provides Poli and Marello some legitimacy. Beyond Sifreddi and Capella's external foes in their wanted climb to the top, their partnership may not survive their fundamental differences, which may ultimately pit each against the other.
