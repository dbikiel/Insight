The arrival of a new girl causes a stir in classroom social structure.
Based on a best-selling novel by Christina Herrstr√∂ms. Every school follows a social structure where the cool and popular dominate and the nerds and quiet types remain in the periphery. Signe is a bright 15 year old girl, but she's very shy and reserved, resigned to being an outsider. Things are as they are, until a new girl arrives who changes everything. Signe finds herself becoming less of a shy girl and a thousand times stronger.
