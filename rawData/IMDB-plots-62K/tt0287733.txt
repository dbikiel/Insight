Western Europe, 1945. The gentle, thoughtful, and sensitive Losey and the mean, base, and vicious Deming are two radically contrasting American soldiers who desert their platoons during the final days of World War II. The pair stumble across a ragtag group of orphans who have been trained as ruthless killers. The two soldiers, the orphans, and the two adults who serve as surrogate parents to the children are forced to make a desperate stand against a Nazi tank battalion who have them trapped inside an old crumbling building.
