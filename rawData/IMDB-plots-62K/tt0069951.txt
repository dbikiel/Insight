A Sheriff, who negotiates with bank robbers, ends up getting his family killed during their escape. The Sheriff chases the gang into Mexico on his own. While attempting to exact his vengeance, he is at odds with a Mexican lawman.
Sheriff Sean Kilpatrick believes guns result in gun solutions to problems. Frank Brand is the leader of a band of bank robbers who have no problem with killing anyone in their way. When their paths cross Kilpatrick's attempt to negotiate results in the death of his family during the escape. Kilpatrick goes against everything he has stood for when he crosses into Mexico to chase Brand and his gang. He demonstrates some violent tendencies towards the criminals and anyone else he comes across in his hunt to kill the gang. His behavior is not very heroic. He is challenged by a Mexican Sheriff interested only in carrying out the law - not vengeance.
