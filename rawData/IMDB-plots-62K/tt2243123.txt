A collection of twenty short films by twenty different directors, all about Taiwan.
10+10 is a project initiated by the Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival to demonstrate the solidarity between Taiwanese film-makers. 20 directors are invited to make a 5-minute short film each on the theme of the Uniqueness of Taiwan, but allowed total freedom in all other aspects. The Festival believes that this collaboration would be a great inspiration for film-makers and audiences.
