Fourteen-year-old J goes by the pronoun 'They' and lives with their parents in the suburbs of Chicago. J is exploring their gender identity while taking hormone blockers to postpone puberty. After two years of medication and therapy, J has to make a decision whether or not to transition. Over this crucial weekend while their parents are away, J's sister Lauren and her maybe/maybe-not Iranian partner Araz arrive to take care of 'They.'
