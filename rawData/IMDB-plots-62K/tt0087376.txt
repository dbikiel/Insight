Gwen is a young girl adopted by a nomad tribe in a desert post-apocalyptic world. In the desert, where only few animals, like ostriches or scorpions, can survive, a mysterious entity regularly drops gigantic replicas of everyday life objects from our world, such as bags, telephones, clocks and armchairs. When a young boy, Gwen's friend, is kidnapped by said entity, Gwen and an old woman called Roseline start on a trip to find him back. They eventually encounter other people living in an isolated city and preserving remains of the old civilisation in strange ways.
