Pablo Francisco, one of the most popular comedians worldwide is back with his all new comedy concert, They Put It Out There. Following the enormous success of his last stand-up special, Ouch!, Pablo once again weaves together his arsenal of characters, spontaneous outbursts and clever insights to create a stand-up show that has the non-stop energy of a jazz riff. They Put It Out There. is a hilarious off-the-wall event that points out the absurdity of a pop-culture obsessed world as only Pablo can share.
