The thirty-eight year-old ambitious and workaholic editor of the fashion magazine Rebelle Alice Lantins returns from Brazil to Paris and loses her flash memory in the airplane. However, the student of architecture Balthazar Apfel finds it and calls Alice to tell her. She schedules a meeting in the bar where Balthazar is drinking with his friends but he tells her that the device is at home. He offers a ride in his scooter to Alice and while he is putting the spare helmet on her, two coworkers of Alice see from an angle that make them believe that Balthazar is kissing Alice. They take a photo and posts it in the Twitter. On the next morning, everybody is laughing at Alice but the chief editor and her boss Vincent Khan loves the idea that Alice is dating someone twenty years younger. Alice decides to impersonate that she is in love with Balthazar to get a promotion in the magazine. But soon she learns that she should not trifle with love.
