A film born out of sexual frustrations.
Two female directors in their thirties, start an investigation based on their own sexual frustrations to understand desire from a female point of view. As an excuse to get more answers, they decide to make a film based on real women's erotic memories and reflections. They send out a casting call and over 100 ordinary Copenhagen women reply. As the shootings progress it dawns on the Filmmakers that what was just meant to be a casting, instead becomes an overwhelming shared experience of intimacy. The casting couch is turned into an exploration space for the young women to share their true desires, fantasies and reflections on their experiences with sex, shame, lust and pleasure. The film gives a rare look into the secret language of young female sexuality.
