A group of thirtysomethings having problems with fidelity gets an opportunity to turn back the clock.
Manhattan. Halley loves Dag, a philanderer who claims he's reformed. Peter, Dag's best friend, loves Rebecca, a suicidal dancer who sleeps around without Peter's knowing. When Halley and Peter learn that Dag and Rebecca have slept together (it started with just a kiss), Halley leaves Dag, and Peter is wounded. In their suffering, Halley meets Andre, a cellist; Peter meets Colleen, Andre's wife; and, a remorseful Dag meets Paula, an edgy waitress with a crush on Peter. Couplings follow; then, several characters end up in hospital. Paula becomes an avenging angel, and Peter may be her next victim. Is there any way these relationships can be set right? Can we go back to that kiss?
