With most of the world blinded and the dangerous carnivorous Triffids set loose, it falls upon a band of scattered survivors to fight this plant invasion and the madness following.
The Triffids are on their way - devouring humans, and most off the planet thinks it's a joke - but is not. Far from it. To help stop the invasion, a group of hold outs fight this invasion of killer plants. But it's not just the plants which need to be eradicated! The followers of a megalomaniac who's built an army of street psychopaths; the man who's name alone brings a chill to one's blood; Torrence. Eeyagh!
