Poverty stricken lovers Eden and Matilda have enough trouble just getting through the days. Their Landlord is trying to terrorize them and strange things seem to be going on at "Juicy Girls", the place where Matilda works... but when Eden buys a pet spider the real troubles start.
Two lesbian, anarcho-punk lovers are in a battle with their greedy landlord. As the couple struggles to make ends meet, a deranged serial killer terrorizes the sleazy nightclub they work at. With a vicious killer on the loose and their merciless landlord on their case, the lovers have nowhere to turn. That is until the arrival of their new mysterious pet spider.
Matildas sleazy job in men-only nightclub Juicy Girls is causing problems with her lesbian lover Eden. But they have no choice - they are two years behind with the rent and their Landlord is threatening eviction. Matilda hates her job, especially the suffocating attention from one particularly obsessed, unhinged customer. But all attempts at borrowing money and claiming benefits have failed. They are desperate for a solution, especially when a brutal serial-killer begins hideously murdering the working girls at the club. A horrific opportunity gives Matilda stolen cash, but the only way to pacify Eden is to let her buy a powerful tarantula spider named Rainer, which changes their lives forever!
