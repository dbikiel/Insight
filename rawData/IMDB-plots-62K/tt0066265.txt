Fed up with their strict parents, Tommy and Annika run away from home, with their friend Pippi Longstocking to look after them in their long trek.
Siblings Tommy and Annika Settergren have fun with their friend Pippi Longstocking at her house Villa Villekulla, until they lose track of time and are greeted at home by their bossy parents, who address them before they angrily run off to bed. Pippi joins the family at breakfast the following morning, when Tommy and Annika, asked by their family to cut the weeds off their strawberry patch, are fed up with not having fun, so they bitterly decide to run away from home. Feeling that their two children might be serious about this, the Settergrens send Pippi to look after them. Pippi, Tommy, and Annika disembark on a long and rigorous trek away from home, during which they befriend an eccentric peddler named Konrad, travel from town to town, ride on top of a train, ride a flying car, and other fun adventures. But the harsher their journey gets, Tommy and Annika eventually learn that they had it a lot better back at home after all...
