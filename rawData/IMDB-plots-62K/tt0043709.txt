Mary Herries (Ethel Barrymore) has a passion for art and fine furniture. Even though she is getting on in years, she enjoys being around these priceless articles. One day she meets a strange young painter named Harry Springer Elcott (Maurice Evans), who uses his painting skill to enter into her life. Little does she expect that his only interest in her is to covet everything she has.
