In today's hectic world, what everyone really needs is a moment of respite.
Respite that is needed to ponder over your relationships, respite to talk to their Near and dear ones, respite to hear the problems of their family and relatives, Respite to share their problems with their friends and well wishers. KSHANBHAR VISHRANTI is the story of four young couples sharing a strong band of friendship, a story about their dreams and aspirations, a story about the blossoming love between them. These four young couples are the representatives of today's youth, who are hard working and will not leave any stone unturned in order to achieve their goals. Always ready to prove their mettle and with their ability to understand and support each other they manage to create a platform that helps them move ahead in life. A thought provoking film with a philosophy of its own, this is a sheer poetry on celluloid.
