A trail of revenge leads a notorious killer and a lawman to a town of fanatics. Blood will flow.
The year is 1887 and the place is the Arizona Territory. The Civil War is over; but further west, the battle to settle this wild land continues. At the eye of this storm of lawlessness is the notorious Tullis Crew. Out for revenge against twelve jurors who condemned his brother to death, Royce Tullis has left a blood-stained trail of vengeance against those who gave his brother the rope. The last notch to be carved on Royce's six-gun is Isaac Ackerman, the jury foreman. Royce and his cohorts descend on the small homestead, dispatching Ackerman and his wife and kidnapping their teenage daughter, Ruth. With US Marshall Quincy Foster and former US Calvary Scout Carson Garret closing in on them, the gang heads north with an aim to sell Ruth into slavery. After losing their way, however, the Tullis crew find themselves in the small community of Eminence Hill, a town run by a group of deeply pious and fanatical homesteaders who've established what they consider a holy oasis in a desolate land of wickedness. How will a group of blood-thirsty cutthroats be received by those who live by God's Law? Will Quincy and Carson find Ruth before it's too late? Only one thing is certain. In Eminence Hill, nothing is as it seems.
