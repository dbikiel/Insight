Albanian teenager, Saimir, emigrates to Italy to start a new life with his father. His father tries to make a living transporting illegal immigrants. When this fails to make his father any money, he is drawn into an insidious prostitution ring. Saimir helps his father, but a love interest makes him question his life and future.
The Albanian teenager Saimir has known only the harsh life of poverty, fear and crime. His father makes a dangerous living trafficking illegal immigrants, like themselves, from Eastern Europe. As these desperate men, women and children land on Italy's southern coast, Saimir must help his father smuggle them through the night to squalid hideouts and into the hands of the local mafia. Yet, when this fails to earn a subsistence living, his father is drawn into even more serious criminal human trafficking. A prostitution ring approaches Saimir's father who accepts to transport girls from Eastern Europe and into virtual slavery. Saimir is even forced to witness the merciless brutality of a rape as a young woman is "initiated" into a future of prostitution. And perhaps this is the beginning of Saimir's true outrage and inner rebellion. The boy is also living in a secret world filled with the tender discovery of first love.
