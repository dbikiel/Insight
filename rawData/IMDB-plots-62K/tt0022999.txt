Nabb controls the pass and lets all the ranchers through except Holderness and his stolen cattle. When Nabb refuses to sell, Holderness works an his son Snap who has run up gambling debts. There is more trouble when Snap becomes jealous of Judy's attraction to the surveyor Jack. When Holderness has Snap killed, everyone heads to town for the showdown.
Judson Holderness owns the biggest saloon and gambling den in White Sage, Utah and also indulges in cattle-rusting and other nefarious activities. But his one desire is to own the valley lands controlled by Adam Naab. Naab first came to the area with a partner. When the partner died, Naab took his young daughter, Judy, to raise and looked forward to the day when his son, Snap, and his foster daughter would be married. But Naab's son has a gambling habit and when he loses heavily at the saloon, Holderness gives him further credit on a promise he will deliver him fifty horses from the herd that his father is rounding up to sell. A stranger enters the saloon and introduces himself as Jack Hare, a surveyor, headed for the Naab ranch. Holderness has no desire to see Naab's land surveyed, so he orders his henchman, "Lefty," to follow Jack, shoot his horse and leave him to die of thirst in the desert. The following morning, as Naab and Judy are trailing the horse herd to the White Sage stockyards, she sees Jack wandering in the desert and they rescue him. Jack also manages to find his surveying tools and instruments. Ere long, a romance develops between Jack and Judy. The latter goes up the mountain range to a cabin near where a large flock of sheep are grazing and Jack, working nearby drops in for a visit. This makes Snap insane with jealousy and he insists that he and Judy be married quickly. Judy, who has no interest in marrying Snap, and slips out a window and starts up the mountain trail looking for Jack.
