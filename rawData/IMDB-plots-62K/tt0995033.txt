A film based on the notorious mass killer Richard Speck, who systematically tortured, raped and murdered a group of student nurses from South Chicago Community Hospital in 1966.
Richard Speck lives in the Dallas, Texas area, and is a seemingly quiet but string man. After divorcing his wife, and to escape the mental evaluation treatment a judge had ordered for him, he leaves Texas and moves to Chicago, where the hell will start.
