Navy Lt. Richard Perry becomes an undercover man out to discover the leaders of a group of well connected men who pull off bank robberies during the McKinley administration (early 20th century).
Dealing with a crime ring in the early years of the 20th century the film tells of the campaign by President William McKinley (Frank Conroy) to halt bank robberies perpetrated by men with high connections. Naval lieutenant Richard . Perry (Robert Taylor) is assigned to be an undercover agent and ferret out the gang leaders and he falls in love with beerhall singer Lil Duryea (Barbara Stanwyck), who is also the sister of Bastite Duryea (Brian Donlevy). Posing as a bank robber, he is wrongly convicted as one of the leaders and sentenced to be hung. He writes to McKinley for aid, but the president is assassinated before the letter arrives. Lil then pleads directly to Theodore Roosevelt (Sidney Blackmer), the incoming president.
President McKinley asks Lieutenant Richard L. Perry to go underground to identify some obviously very well briefed Mid-Western bank robbers. He infiltrates the gang in St Paul but to try and get to the well-placed informant he finds he is becoming more and more involved in their crimes and with Lil, sister of one of the gang members.
