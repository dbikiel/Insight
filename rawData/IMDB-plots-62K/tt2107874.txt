Steffi (Mirjam Weichselbraun) has everything she could wish for: a modeling career, a successful man and a chic home. Only the desire to have children will not come true. To start the good fortune off, Steffi chooses an anonymous donor, which should offer the child the best genes. When she finds out that her husband is cheating on her, Steffi turned desperately to the begetter of the baby. His name is Tommi (Oliver Wnuk) and it comes to light that he is a loser in comic-shirt and baggy jeans.
Former model Steffi (25) has everything that she considers important for a perfect future: a man who can support her financially, a beautiful house and a pregnancy, albeit via sperm donation. Nobody's perfect after all. But when Steffi discovers her husband is cheating on her, she is determined to find out who the real father of her child is. Which is how she ends up at Tommi Gehrke's (26) garden shed and finds her worst nightmare: the prototype of a total looser.
