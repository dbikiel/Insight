The "adventures" of some friends during their military service.
With his surname bearing an uncanny resemblance to that of the leader of the military coup d'Ã©tat that took place in Greece on 21 April 1967, Georgios Papadopoulos, the ecstatic Greek Army soldier and father of two, Yannis Papadopoulos, is transferred to the newly founded Armed Forces Television. There--being close to his wife and children, and believing that he hit the jackpot--instead, the young cinematographer and the inventive motley crew of brothers-in-arms will find themselves face-to-face with the authoritarian regime, and the ugly truth of a new reality. Under those circumstances, can loafing and camouflage work?
The film is the story of a group of soldiers, who, in the course of their compulsory military service in 1967 and 1968, before and during the military dictatorship in Greece, are assigned to the then recently founded Armed Forces Television. This TV station, founded for the civilian population, was run by the Cinematographic Unit of the army which until then had only produced propaganda films and newsreels and was responsible for entertaining the troops and other charity organizations with movie screenings. The personnel was composed mostly of soldiers, who already had experience in the film business in their civilian lives, as well as those who received their training in the army. The story may be only 95% true, but that is simply because the true story is even more absurd...
