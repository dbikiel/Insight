Joey Evans' a charming, handsome, funny, talented a-1st class, A-NÂ°.1... heel. When Joey meets the former chorus girl ("she used to be 'Vera...with the vanishing veils'") and now is the rich widow, Vera Simpson, the pair of lecherous souls seem made for each other. That is, until Linda English comes along. Linda's a "mouse on the chorus line" and built like there's no tomorrow. But she's the typical good little girl from a good little home - just the right ingredient to louse up Joey's set-up.
