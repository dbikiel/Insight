In the years of military coup, Turkey was unable to produce its own cars. But Pasha believed that Turkish people can produce their own cars so he ordered 2 cars. Gunduz and engineers with him must produce 2 cars in only 130 days!
It is just after the military take over of the administration in 1960. The new head of state believes Turkey can only be independent if it is economically strong. After sounding out the weak private sector and most of the senior bureaucrats, it is clear that nobody has a similar view. So, he dares the government sector to see if anyone can design and produce a 100% original car within 4 months... Well, one engineer shares this vision and a small and dedicated team start working in a locomotive factory. Time is short and resources are limited. Many believe this can not be achieved. This is the story of a team of idealist engineers working on this vision.
