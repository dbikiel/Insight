Two hard heads sisters bring their mother on vacation to help her recover from being dumped.
Sisters Rose and Alice couldn't be more different. Rose is free-spirited and parties all night, while Alice is a responsible, reserved mother of two. They can't agree on anything -- except when it comes to their depressed mother, Françoise, who was recently dumped by their father for a much younger woman. Their mission: cheer her up, and get her back in the game. And what better place than an all-inclusive resort on the island of Réunion?
