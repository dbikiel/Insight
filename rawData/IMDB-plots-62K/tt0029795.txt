Insects gather at a night caf√© to watch an Apache dance act and a jazz band with comical results.
A nightclub, staffed and frequented entirely by insects. Lighting provided by fireflies, card games dealt by centipedes. The stage show has a good girl beetle resisting the advances of a bad-boy spider. Everyone dances, even the snails, as the orchestra plays jazz on their instruments made of flowers.
