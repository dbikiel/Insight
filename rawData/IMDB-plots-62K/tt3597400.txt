We all love food. As a society, we devour countless cooking shows, culinary magazines and foodie blogs. So how could we possibly be throwing nearly 50% of it in the trash? Filmmakers and food lovers Jen and Grant dive into the issue of waste from farm, through retail, all the way to the back of their own fridge. After catching a glimpse of the billions of dollars of good food that is tossed each year in North America, they pledge to quit grocery shopping and survive only on discarded food. What they find is truly shocking.
Upon learning that 40% of the food that is produced globally ultimately gets discarded, couple documentarians Grant Baldwin and Jenny Rustemeyer decide to embark on a six month experiment of eating only food that is discarded or will imminently be discarded, with them even willing to purchase it. The one exception will be meals to which they have been invited by family or friends. As their six month progresses, they are surprised about how easy it becomes to find perfectly good food (especially once they learn the routine of where to find it) but how difficult it is to get food when they ask for it. They also find that they have to reassess their views from eating preplanned meals or eating what they may be craving to eating what is available. In addition to their experiment, food activists are interviewed, they who provide their perspective on among other things the unnecessary reasons for the food waste, which are largely aesthetic and economic, misconceptions by the public especially concerning "best before" dates and by companies as to the donation of what they believe to be perfectly good food, and the unforeseen problematic issues of most of that discarded food going to landfills.
