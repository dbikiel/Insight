In November, a flock of Adelie penguin males arrives on the shores of Antarctica after the Antarctic winter in order to prepare nests for females to hatch eggs. The leader of the pack is Penguin Toto, whose wife Lala lays eggs in due time and goes with the other females to the sea to recuperate, and in their absence Toto and other males hatch eggs. After a month and a half, some males, unable to withstand the famine, leave the nests and the colony is immediately attacked by gull-eaters pulling eggs. Toto, protecting the neighbor's nest, ultimately does not have time to save his own. He can only save two eggs from two different nests. As a result, Toto decides to leave only one egg, and the other gives to the family of other penguins, who have not survived. After a certain time, the boy they call Lolo hatch from Toto and Lala's eggs.
Scamper is a little penguin who loves wandering around the Artic where he lives with his parents. Unfortunately his little adventures tend to get he, and his friend Snowflake into trouble, especially when he disobeys his father and goes exploring with seagulls who want to eat him flying above, and men and dogs on the ground with them. One day the adventure goes too far and they float out to sea, only to be caught by men who want to sell them to the zoo. Scamper, Snowflake and their new friend, a macaroni penguin named Louie, must escape and get back to their families to warn them.
