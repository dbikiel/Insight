In 2022, a repair crew is sent to fix an orbital weapon but their spaceship malfunctions and ends up heading towards the dark side of the moon. There, in a mysterious, seemingly abandoned space shuttle, a sinister force lies in wait.
It is the year 2022. A mysterious systems failure causes the crew of a spaceship to be stranded on the dark side of the moon, while rapidly running out of fuel and oxygen. They are surprised to discover a NASA space shuttle floating in space, and board it in the hope of salvaging some supplies. One by one, the crew is possessed and killed, and it is up to Paxton Warner to find the links between the dark side of the moon, the Bermuda Triangle, and the Devil himself.
"The Dark Side of The Moon" takes place in 2022 as the crew of a spaceship is forced to land on the entitled dark side of the moon because of an obscure system failure. Unexpectedly a decades-old NASA shuttle, which went missing in action, appears and drifts towards them. They board the space-wreck in hope of finding some supplies or oxygen stored, not knowing that the ship originally vanished in the spooky Bermuda Triangle! And neither is any of them aware of the fact that Satan itself is waiting on the ship, quite eager to bloodily snatch the souls of all crew members as part of a scheme by which Satan may rightfully return to Heaven...
