A witch becomes one if at age thirteen she takes a mandatory one-year trip to find herself and perfect her skills. Kiki takes the trip and lands in a seaside town where she begins supporting herself and her black cat by offering a delivery service. The young witch is soon embroiled in a bakery, a wind mill, a zoo, teenage antics and a medical emergency. It is when she is most needed, however, that Kiki has to find the resolve to continue.
