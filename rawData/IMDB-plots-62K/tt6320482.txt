Tyler tries to discover the father she never got the chance to meet in this stirring psycho-sexual ghost story, exploring themes of gender and sexual identity.
Young adult Tyler Kent lives with her selfish mother, Joan Kent. While Tyler has just been laid off from her bookstore clerk job in the store being shut down, Joan runs a scam collecting disability while she isn't really disabled, the money especially important when the child support payments from her ex-husband Octavio Soler, a Mexican immigrant, ran out. They divorced when Tyler was an infant, Tyler never having seen or heard from her father since, he who she doesn't remember at all. Joan believes they've hit the jackpot when they learn that Octavio has passed away, he having left everything to Tyler. Not wanting anything from a man she felt abandoned them, Tyler turns everything over to Joan. But when Tyler learns that Joan has hid certain keys aspects of Octavio from her all these years in her own selfishness, Tyler decides to run away to live at least for the time being in Octavio's rundown and cluttered apartment in the city, partly to get away from her mother, but more to learn whatever she can about her father. Tyler ends up learning about Octavio from more sources than she had expected, his spirit which is still present in the apartment. In following a lead, Tyler decides to assume Octavio's identity, and to those that knew Octavio she presents herself as his son. She may come to a better understanding of Octavio through a young man named Apostolis Zachariou, who Octavio mentored in his writing. In the process, she has to decide how much she will tell Apostolis for who she is falling, he only knowing her as Octavio's son.
