France sends you its two best agents...
Ben and Bill are the two worst, completely useless agents - real losers. But who else would you send on a super-difficult top-secret mission? The French have just sold a new high-power M51 rocket to the Russians for crazy money. Unfortunately for them, the rocket was hijacked before they could get it of their hands. However, not just any fool is up to neutralizing this threat, but only the craziest and most stupid of them can cope with such a task. An unforgettable voyage awaits them - from Paris to the fairytale Jamaica and right into the enemy's lair! Nothing can stop these bunglers, not tanks, not ninjas and not even a team of top models! No, these guys have their own style, which seems to save the day...
