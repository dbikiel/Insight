A reformed bank robber is taken hostage by a desperate man during a bank hold up, but is forced to go on the run with his captor when they're both mistakenly thought to be in cahoots.
On his first day after being released from jail for 14 armed bank robberies, Lucas finds himself caught up in someone else's robbery. Perry has decided to hold up the local bank to raise money so that he can keep his daughter, Meg, and get her the treatment she needs. Dugan, a detective, assumes Lucas helped plan the robbery, and hence Lucas, Perry and Meg become three fugitives.
Daniel Lucas, who was recently released from prison after being there because of 14 bank robberies, walks into a bank to start an account, then Ned Perry walks into the bank and tries to rob the place, taking Lucas hostage. Detective Dugan, knowing Lucas's history, assumes that Lucas and Ned are pulling the heist together. With no choice in the matter, Lucas is forced to engineer their getaway. Complicating the situation further is Ned's 6-year-old daughter Meg, who has been mute since the death of her mother. With his bank account depleted, Ned loves Meg so much that he has robbed the bank to get enough money to get Meg the psychiatric care she needs, and so he can have enough money to have custody of Meg and raise her. Meg loves Ned, and finds herself drawn to Lucas as well. While they are on the lam from the cops, the three of them begin to bond as a makeshift family.
