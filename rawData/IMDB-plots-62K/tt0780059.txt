Based on the true story of a Miami Beach nightclub owner who takes a young employee under his wing, while trying to avoid bankruptcy and the mafia.
Chris Troiano runs South Beach (greater Miami)'s most popular nightclub, a recreational goldmine. Fellow New York immigrant Andy Burnett quickly rises from bouncer on trial to Troiano's trusted security chief and right hand. Thus he slowly discovers the club's entanglement with both the Russian mafia and domestic mob king Allie Boy, obviously involved in murders and arson. Andy is in fact an undercover cop, but risks losing trust with all superiors, except his immediate chief, so a trap must urgently be set.
