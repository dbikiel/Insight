"Rigoletto" retold at Christmas time in Manhattan's corporate world. Rick, an executive at Image, is a jerk to a woman applying for a job. That evening, he's out for drinks with his much younger boss, Duke, and the same women is their waitress. Rick's continued rudeness leads to her getting fired. She puts a curse on him. A potential rift with Duke quickly surfaces; Rick is approached by the hail-fellow Buck, who runs His Own Company, offering to rid Rick of Duke. At dinner later that night, Rick and Duke's paths cross again; this time Rick is with his stunning and beloved daughter, Eve, a student who has a secret relationship with Duke. All paths lead to the office holiday party.
