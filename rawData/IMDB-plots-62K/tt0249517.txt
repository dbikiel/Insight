A man facing middle-age and a failing marriage finds a time slip that can take him back to the end of the 19th Century.
Charles Lattimer is an everyday man facing middle age and a marriage coming to an end, who stumbles across a time slip, that occurs on one of his regular train journeys (as the train goes through a tunnel) coming across an antique watch, he learns it allows him to get off the train during the time-slip, whereupon he finds himself back in the 1890s. Before long he finds a new found love, and purpose there. But complications occur when the portal back to the past starts to close with his timepiece breaking soon after, leading to a decision that could leave him stranded out of his own time.
