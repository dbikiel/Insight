A family takes refuge in a bomb shelter to avoid a dangerous outbreak.
In the film, Ray (Skarsg√•rd), Claire (Riseborough) and their seven-year-old daughter, Zoe, are an average American family in Kingsville, North Carolina - except they have existed in a bomb shelter since escaping a day of devastation that changed everything. For 301 days, they have transformed their cement prison into a home, holding on to memories of the past and hope for a normal life someday. And for 301 days, the family has eluded what looms above the surface - the heavy breathing and booming footsteps that punctuate the night, threatening their fragile existence. All the while, the family has managed to stay hidden. Until now. Now their safe haven has been breached... and something is coming for them.
In Kingsville, Ray, his wife Claire and their little daughter Zoe "Zozo" have been living in an underground shelter for three hundred days hidden from the "Breathers". They have created and follow four rules to stay alive. Ray frequently recalls when an outbreak reached Kingsville and the army bombed the whole town during the quarantine, and he believes they are the only survivors. When they find that many supplies have been stolen from the pantry, Ray finds that a rat is the responsible. They chase the rodent and there is an accident with a kerosene lamp that burns a table. Now they are afraid that the "Breathers" might have seen the smoke. Will they be safe in the shelter?
