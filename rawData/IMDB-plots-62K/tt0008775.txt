A rich young Easterner who has always wanted to live in "the Wild West" plans to move to a Western town. Unknown to him, the town's "wild" days are long gone, and it is an orderly, civilized place now. The townsmen, not wanting to lose a rich potential resident, contrive to make over the town to suit the young man's fantasy.
Jeff Hillington, a New Yorker and heir to a railroad, loves the wild west. Trouble is, he imagines it as it was in the 1880s. When he decides to take a trip to Bitter Creek, Arizona, his father arranges that everything will look like it did in 1880, but to protect everyone from accident, everybody packing a pistol will only carry blanks. The local Indians, tired of their lot, get wind of the charade and attack the town with real bullets. It falls to Jeff to get from the saloon to his cache of arms through a hail of bullets, get arms back to the townfolks, and subdue the uprising. Does true love await his heroism?
