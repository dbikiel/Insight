During the dark years of the German Occupation in Greece, the mysterious disappearance of a cherished tomcat throws a destitute factory worker straight into the bowels of Kommandantur, to taste firsthand the oppressor's lavish hospitality.
Suddenly, during the already dark and turbulent years of the German Occupation in Greece, the weary and destitute factory worker, Thanasis, finds himself enmeshed in a life-threatening tangle of lies. Constantly under the Nazis' heavy thumb, the mysterious disappearance of a much-loved tomcat combined with a preposterous accusation is bound to complicate matters, throwing poor Thanasis straight into the bowels of Kommandantur, to taste firsthand the oppressor's warm and lavish hospitality. Now, the officials of the Third Reich in war-torn Athens suspect that there is more to Thanasis than meets the eye, and, as usual, there is only one solution to such kinds of persistent problems. Death, destruction--and in the middle--a hungry and innocent Thanasis always running for his life. Is this what you did in the war, Thanasis?
