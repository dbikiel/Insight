Paranormal investigator Zak Bagans documents the most authenticated case of possession in American history.
The story takes place with doing a docudrama about the home he purchased in Gary, Indiana. He convinces a couple of previous tenants to come back and discuss their accounts of the frightening ordeals that they endured during their stay at the home. A woman becomes possessed and begins speaking in tongues. Following the extreme amount of activity documented, production had to be halted, but the movie has been finished one year later and, boy, are you in for one edge of your seat demonic thrill ride.
In high hopes of proving that the supernatural forces exist, Zak Bagans--the American paranormal investigator and host of the spooky reality TV series, Ghost Adventures (2008)--summons up the courage not only to visit but also buy the 200-Demons House in Gary, Indiana. In the following days, Zak's crew will capture eerie sounds, hair-raising shadows, and witness the abnormally high levels of magnetism in the dark basement: the epicentre of the demonic force, and the alleged portal to Hell. Is the Ammons' Demon House the next Amityville?
