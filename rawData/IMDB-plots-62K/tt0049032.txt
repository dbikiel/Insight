Witch Hazel's claim to be the ugliest witch of all is threatened by a Halloween witch who turns out to be Bugs trick-or-treating.
On Halloween night, Bugs Bunny goes out trick-or-treating dressed as a witch, wearing an ugly green mask. He comes to the creepy archaic mansion of Witch Hazel, who's making a batch of witch's brew. Hazel prides herself on being the ugliest witch of all and mistakes Bugs for a real witch. She becomes jealous of Bugs' ugliness and makes him a cup of Pretty Potion disguised as tea. Once Bugs removes his mask, Hazel soon learns that he's the remaining ingredient for her witch's brew. A chase soon ensues, but before Bugs is done for, Hazel drinks the Pretty Potion. Her worst nightmare comes true - she becomes young and beautiful. What's more, she flees from the genie in her magic mirror.
