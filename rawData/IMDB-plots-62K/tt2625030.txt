An undercover cop finds it difficult to play both a cop and a goon.
As Korea's biggest crime organization 'Goldmoon' expands its powers, Kang, the head of police investigation planning department, orders the undercover cop Ja-Seoung to participate in project "New World", that will take down 'Goldmoon'. Ja-seong must choose either to follow Kang's orders as a cop or to keep his loyalty with Jeong Cheong, the under-boss of the 'Goldmoon' crime organization.
The head of the Goldmoon crime syndicate is dead, leaving his top two lieutenants. Seizing the opportunity, the police launch an operation with the perfect weapon: Ja-sung, the boss's right hand man, has been a deep-cover operative for 8 years, closely watched by handler Police chief Kang. With a baby on the way, and living in mortal fear of being exposed as a mole, Ja-sung is torn between his duty and honor as a cop, and the fiercely loyal gang members who will follow him to hell and back. Using inside information from Ja-sung to damage the relationship between the two feuding contenders, suspicions grow that a traitor lives in their ranks. Ruthless Jung escalates the game by hiring hackers to search the police database. As Operation New World closes in, and with the stakes climbing higher and a gangland bloodbath guaranteed among those that remain, Ja-sung makes a final, shocking decision no one could have predicted.
Ja-seong (Lee Jeong-jae), an undercover police officer, must choose either to follow Kang (Min-sik Choi)s orders as a cop or to keep his loyalty with Jeong Cheong (Jeong-min Hwang), the under boss of the Goldmoon crime organization.
