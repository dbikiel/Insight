Go Mi-Nyu, a girl about to become a nun, is asked to cover for her indisposed twin brother, Mi-Nam, who's on the verge of becoming a k-idol. To do so, she disguises herself as a boy and joins A.N.Jell, a really popular boy band.
Go Mi Nyu is a girl who wants to be a nun, for she has lived in a convent since she was abandoned there with her twin brother Go Mi Nam - whose dream is to become a singer so he can meet their mother - after their father died.
One day, a stranger gets in contact with Go Mi Nyu and asks her to impersonate her brother while he recovers from a surgery because he has been chosen to be a part of Korea's famous kpop boy band, A.N.JELL.
It becomes a difficult task when she is taken to live with the other three guys from the band and even more difficult because the leader and vocalist, Hwang Tae Kyung is mean to her. However, when he discovers the truth about Go Mi Nyu - along with the guitarist, Shin Woo, though each of them think they're the only ones who know the secret - Tae Kyung tries to protect her, and feelings are born between him and Mi Nyu.
A secret binds the fates of the two people, a truth that will test those feelings between them and can bring them apart.
