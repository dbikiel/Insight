A psychotic killer gets in the good graces of his aging invalid employer, and worms his way into the affection of her beautiful daughter, with unpleasant results for all.
Danny is a working-class psychopath who moves in with a wealthy widow to redecorate her house. He plays "games" with her while sleeping with her daughter and maid.
Elderly invalid Mrs. Bramson lives in a house in the English countryside. Her adult daughter, Olivia, who is in an unsatisfying marriage, acts as her live-in caregiver. When her housekeeper, Dora, brings Danny, her fianc√©, by the house for an "inspection", Mrs. Bramson immediately falls under the spell of the gregarious young man and hires him to be her live-in Jack-of-all-trades. First and foremost, he acts as her playmate. In addition, Olivia has a love-hate fascination with this new man who has entered the household. However, none of the three women know Danny's secret.
