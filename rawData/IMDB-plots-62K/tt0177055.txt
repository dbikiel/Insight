The voiceovers of a man and a woman comment on the sexual habits of the populations of the most diverse corners of the Earth: Polynesia, Copenhagen, Africa, New Jersey, England, Mexico, Italy and Sweden. Beginning with headlines that flow on the exhibition of sculptures and paintings with erotic themes, we move on to the representation of bizarre and rough situations, including: natives of Polynesia forced to intercourse with their countrymen several times a day, shops of hairdresser offering services for homosexual clients, an orgy offered to young guests of a luxury apartment, a schoolroom where two students practice sex during the lesson, dancers performing on the tombs of the dead in Mexico, a fashion show with men wearing women's clothes, sexual services for men and women lent aboard caravans.
