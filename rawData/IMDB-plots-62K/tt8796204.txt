Very different sisters Rike and Nicola annually make a joint exotic voyage. This time chaotic do-gooder Nicola chose Salamanca, Spain, failing to tell she actually booked to a paying volunteers program, two weeks in self-service inns to help restore a traditional route St.Jacob's pilgrimage to Compostella. Organized, bossy younger Rike still stays, feeling she must solve Rike's marital crisis meanwhile. The volunteers reside in the rural inn of old Felipe, who got his efficient son Carlos, who runs a languages school in Salamanca with his wife, as his unreliable hedonistic brother Pablo missed up again. While both sibling pairs argue, Rike and Carlos get romantically involved.
