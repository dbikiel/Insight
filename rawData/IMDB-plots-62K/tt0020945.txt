The stage stars Wheeler and Woolsey play two soldiers who go absent without leave in Paris, during World War I.
The popular stage-to-screen comedy duo of Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey are a pair of wayward, womanizing soldiers who cause havoc during World War I. Curly-haired Tommy (Wheeler) and the bespectacled Gilbert (Woolsey) go AWOL in Paris, heedless of the fuming MPs on their trail. Gilbert falls for Mademoiselle Olga (Leni Stengel) while Tommy meets up with the flighty Annette (Dorothy Lee, a Wheeler and Woolsey favorite) and proceeds to woo her, unaware that she is the youngest daughter of commanding officer Colonel Marshall! Keeping one step ahead of the army's grip proves to be a challenge for the two oddballs, who wind up on the front lines in the middle of a fierce battle! Amidst all of their hysterical double-talk and screwball antics, the pair find time to sing and dance with their gals, as Tommy serenades Annette with "Whistling the Blues Away" and Gilbert gets stripped down to his shorts in a duet with Olga called "Nothing But Love."
