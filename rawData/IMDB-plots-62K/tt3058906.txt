When four high school best friends' lives are dramatically changed on the night of a near fatal accident, eighteen years later they're reunited, only to discover that a set of past and present secrets will alter the course of their futures forever.
The Award Winning film "CRU" is about a tight knit group of young high school athletes that experience a terrible crash after winning the state championship -- a catastrophe that will shape all their lives. But as adults, some 15 years later, they come together again for a reunion that will open olds wounds, expose long-hidden secrets -- and pave the road to forgiveness and redemption.
