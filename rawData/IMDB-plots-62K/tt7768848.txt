When the world's most controversial guru builds an utopian city deep in the Oregon country, conflict with the locals escalates into a national scandal. A true story.
When a controversial guru builds an utopian city in the Oregon desert, it causes a massive conflict with local ranchers. This docuseries chronicles the conflict, which leads to the first bioterror attack in the United States and a massive case of illegal wiretapping. It is a pivotal, but largely forgotten, time in American cultural history that tested the country's tolerance for the separation of church and state.
In the early 1980s, a guru, Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, moves from India to near the town of Antelope, Oregon, USA. He buys a large ranch and sets up a commune for his followers, building an entire city from scratch. The architect and implementer of his plans is his devoted secretary, Ma Anand Sheela. The local townsfolk react badly to their new neighbours, resulting in a very antagonistic relationship between the two sides. Tensions eventually boil over in a series of bizarre events. Eventually, law enforcement authorities, state and federal, get involved.
