Greedy duck hates Christmas but loves money. Greedy duck treats employees and customers poorly. Greedy duck has an existential experience where he confronts the darkest parts of his psyche as well as the repressed joy he all but forgot existed within himself.
In this modern adaption of "A Christmas Carol", Daffy Duck, in an Ebenezer Scrooge role, is visited by three Christmas Ghosts of Past (Granny and Tweety), Present (Yosemite Sam) and Future (Tazmanian Devil) one snowy Christmas Eve and learns about the repercussions of greed, the values of family, kindness and the true meaning of Christmas.
In this adaptation of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, Daffy Duck is the greedy proprietor of the Lucky Duck Mega-Mart and all he can think about is the money to be made during the holiday season. Disgruntled employees like Assistant Manager Porky Pig, Marvin Martian, Speedy Gonzales, and Elmer Fudd plead to Daffy Duck for small concessions like a day off on Christmas and discounted toys, but Daffy is relentless in his pursuit of the almighty dollar. It's up to last minute shopper Bugs Bunny; the ghosts of Christmases past (Tweety and Granny), present (Yosemite Sam) and future (Taz); and Porky Pig's young daughter Priscilla to make Daffy see the error of his ways and discover the true meaning of Christmas.
