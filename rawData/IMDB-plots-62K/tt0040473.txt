Vincent Doane is in the precarious position of trying to close an advertising account with his rich ex-fianc√©e. Unfortunately she is more interested in him than in business. Vincent's wife Paula gets suspicious and finally decides to do some flirting of her own to make him jealous. Unknown to her, she chooses cigarette tychoon Claude Kimball. In fact, Kimball hits it off well with both of the Doanes. The question is whether or not their marriage can survive all the shenanigans.
Paula Doane believes her husband, Vincent, is having an affair but instead he is only trying to land an account for the advertising agency which he works for. Yet, Vincent is hiding something from Paula-his client is actually his former girlfriend, but, he believes that if Paula knew this, she'd misinterpret everything. In the meantime, Paula thinks the only way to rekindle their romance is to make Vincent jealous. She goes to the Burke Agency to hire an actor to flirt with her while she and Vincent dine at a nightclub restaurant. However, Mr. Burke "tips off" Vincent about his wife's plan. He now thinks he "holds all the cards", and will play along with the joke. Yet, the joke is actually on Vincent, when the seating arrangements for the actor are switched, and in his place is seated Claude Kimball, the tycoon tabacco owner. Now the fun truly begins.
