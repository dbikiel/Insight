Construction foreman Pegleg Pete has just fired his riveter; Donald comes by and takes the job, despite a lack of experience and an initial fear of heights, and makes a mess of things.
Dodgy construction foreman Pegleg Pete has just fired his riveter. Donald is in need of a job, so he pretends to be experienced and gets it, lacking any competitor. Even the open elevator on the every skyscraper is enough to make Donald sickeningly dizzy, high up the roofless top-floor without railings the work is spooky, but the boss keeps coming up to keep a close eye on him. The damned riveting machine has its own will and much more strength then any duck: it ends up dragging the duck on a wild ride. Greenhorn Donald must also 'serve' lunch, an equilibrium nightmare while the riveting colleagues work their seismic vibes, till short-tempered Pete...
