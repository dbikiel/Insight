Inspired by letters he reads when he buys a 150-year old farmhouse, writer/director Rory Feek pens a story about the wife of a civil war soldier who enlists in the army and fights her way across the country to find her missing husband. As Rory is taken on Josephine's incredible journey, he personally dreams of having a love like hers. In the end, he gets that and so much more.
