Some men infiltrate the retired chief engineer Arthur JÃ¶nsson's home. They look through the residence for a few drawings. Some time later the same men, who turn out to be former Swedish military, perform a robbery. A robbery that Johan Falk and his colleagues at GSI believe is just a rehearsal of a much larger robbery. A robbery that, as it turns out, will make all other robberies in police history pale in comparison.
