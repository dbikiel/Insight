An inspector newly transferred to the small Mount Blanc region got a strange case, of a man whose body was trapped in the ice for 15 years - and his parents thought that he was in Australia that whole time.
In the sumptuous setting of the Mont Blanc, a family secret in the form of a perfectly conserved body has remained buried deep in the ice for 15 years. Its reappearance will spark off many emotions. Everyone had believed that Bertrand Santini had been living happily abroad all those years. The difficult task of solving the mystery surrounding Bertrand Santini's death falls to Police Lieutenant Martin Le Kerrec. From false leads to good intuition, from false suspects to true revelations, the young policeman will gently but determinedly untangle the painful secret weighing down on two families who have lived a lie for fifteen years. Although the investigation will eventually show that there was no murder, it will also bring to light victims whose destinies will be bowled over by the discovery of the truth.
