He decides to stay put and avenge this slaying but ends up dealing with aspiring politician, Indu Sakseria, who wants to wed him; his brother, Prithviraj, who has been granted control of the Rashtrawadi Party but is facing imprisonment on charges of Assaulting a Police Officer and Sexual Molestation; his cousin, Veerendra, who wants control of the party; and his astute maternal uncle, Brij Gopal - who secretly controls the entire family.

Raajneeti is the story of one mans struggle to keep away from his family's business -- politics. But having been sucked in, he must fight to master the game and unwillingly descend into the moral hell that is Indian democracy. The rivalry of two sets of cousins escalates into an all-out war and draws the protagonist into the dark side of dealing with his enemies, thus completing his own journey into corruption. At the heart of this drama is political gamesmanship, unstoppable ambition, a blind lust for power and those who wield it at will.
