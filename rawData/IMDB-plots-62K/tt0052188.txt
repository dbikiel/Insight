Two brothers, one wanted for murder, are shipwrecked on an island inhabited by nubile young women who have amassed a valuable cache of pearls.
Two men escaping the police by ship are blown off course by a typhoon and shipwrecked on an uncharted island populated by women who make a living diving for pearls. What the men don't know is that the women are also part of a shark cult that sacrifices young virgins to the sharks in the surrounding ocean in order to appease the shark gods.
Chris Johnson helps his brother Jim, who is a fugitive on a murder charge, to escape from the law on his boat. They are shipwrecked on a reef near a supposed uninhabited island but are pulled from the shark-filled waters by Mahia, one of a group of sarong-clad, nubile beauties living there. Their leader, Queen Pua, tells them that they will have to wait for a company supply boat to take them away. After Chris saves Mahia from being sacrificed to the shark-gods by Queen Pua and Jim steals the Queen's cache of pearls, the men try to make good their escape with a stolen canoe.
