It's the last day of the year and Fito and his gang of eternal losers are ready to set on fire their giant doll. In La Plata, Argentina, tradition invites to all young boys and girls to build and burn these kind of figures as a symbol of all bad things people are leaving behind and as a hope of the new things to come. But there's a problem: someone stole it, and the group of avengers will have to find out who did it. They will confront all kinds of gangs and dangers before it's too late. And trust us, when we say all kinds, we really mean it, because not even Fito and his friends are aware of the ancient forces that plot against them.
It's the last day of the year and everything is ready for the Doll Burning Tradition of New Year's Eve! Fito and his friends have worked hard for months building their doll, with the hope of overcoming their 'town's losers' reputation. But... someone has stolen it! Now they must get it back by searching for it all over town and defeating lots of dangerous rival gangs!
