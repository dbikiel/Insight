A survey of the world's oceans, emphasizing the fact that it's a single interconnected ocean, and the dependence of all life on the ocean. Along the way we spend time with some surfers, with researchers cataloging and tracking whales, a Coast Guard rough weather rescue squad, a deep-ocean research team, and in the Palau Islands, notably at a saltwater lake with an unusual jellyfish variety.
