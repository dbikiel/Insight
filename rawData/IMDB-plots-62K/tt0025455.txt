In a horse-riding rodeo contest bad guys want John Weston to lose. When he doesn't go along they add some insurance: a poisoned needle just under his saddle.
The Marshal sends John Weston to a rodeo to see if he can find out who is killing the rodeo riders who are about to win the prize money. Barton has organized the rodeo and plans to leave with all the prize money put up by the townspeople. When it appears that Weston will beat Barton's rider, he has his men prepare the same fate for him that befell the other riders.
John Weston (John Wayne), the man from Utah, drifts into town just as Marshal Higgins (George 'Gabby' Hayes), is shooting it out with three bank robbers. Higgins asks Weston to assist him in the investigation of a crooked rodeo-promoting gang that has been cheating neighboring towns of the their money and the mysterious deaths of the top rodeo performers.
