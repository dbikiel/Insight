A naive and simpleton villager is trying to marry the landlord's doughter, who is in love with a vigilante outlaw
Salako is a naive-man and anybody doesn't care him. Also, Salako loves Agha's daughter, Emine. One day, Emine needed to help because she forced to marry and she wanted to help from Salako. Thanks to this way, she could reach her boyfriend, Hamido. He was a bandit. Emine and Salako left the village with Salako's donkey, Kadife. Salako was wanting to Emine during the journey but Emine was loving the Hamido and she had to stall the Salako. This was not difficult because Salako was some idiot man. Emine escaped to Hamido at the first chance but When Emine reached the Hamido, he made fun of him and he caught the Emine and Salako to take away to Agha. Emine untied her ropes and killed Hamido en route but by mistake, people supposed the Salako killed Hamido so everyone started to fear the Salako. Salako killed one by one Hamido's men. By the way, Salako realized everything and he wasn't a naive man anymore and Emine regretted what she did. Emine wanted Salako to forgive him. Salako forgave to Emine so Salako and Emine were happy forever.
