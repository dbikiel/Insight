The story that the children of indifferent parents may have a psychological trauma.
The girl dreams of having a dog, but a strict and busy mother does not allow her to do this. Then the girl begins to play with her knitted mitten, imagining that it's a puppy. The girl so much wants to have a dog, that the mitten in her dreams turns into a real puppy, while retaining a "knitted" texture and pattern of three black checkers on her back.
