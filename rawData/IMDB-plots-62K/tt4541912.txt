Neznayka is an extremely self-confident boy bully. He does not want to learn anything, does not recognize any authority and does not listen to anyone. Surrendering to a sudden impulse, the hero decides to become a musician, then an artist, then a chauffeur. However, none of the professions lazy and wayward scamp does not want to master. As a result, he does not succeed, he is expelled from everywhere. Neznayka thinks about the reasons for his failures and understands: to become an expert in any field, you need to work hard and hard.
