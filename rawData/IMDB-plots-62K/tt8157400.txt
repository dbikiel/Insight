In Tijuca, during the seventies the young Erasmo Carlos is feeding a passion: Rock and Roll. As a fan of Elvis, Bill Haley and Chuck Berry, he learns how to play the guitar while he lives his dreams, gigs and small misdemeanors. His fame as a rocker attracts Roberto Carlos and they soon become partners and friends. Huge success came with the TV show Jovem Guarda, that starred Roberto, Erasmo and Wanderlea. "Minha Fama de Mau" is an emotional dive into the music and life of Erasmo Carlos, with the mind of a man and heart of a boy that turned into the Tremend√£o, a symbol of Brazilian national rock.
