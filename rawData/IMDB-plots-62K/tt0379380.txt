A celebrity actress who gets her dream role playing real-life 19th century serial killer Belle Gunness in a feature film, starts to take on the characteristics of the character both on-screen and off.
Rebecca Fairbanks is a movie star, a method actress making her first film in three years following a breakup with Jake Fields, her co-star in the new film. They're on location in Romania, Jake's new wife is with him, and Rebecca's stage mother, Mona, is close by monitoring Beka's every move. The film they're making is about a mass murderer in Indiana in the early twentieth century, who lured men to her farmhouse with a promise of marriage. Jake plays the widow's farmhand, lover, and partner in crime. As Rebecca gets deeper into her part, people around the set start to die. Who's the murderer? Is there a madness to her method?
