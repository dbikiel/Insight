Paul is a tax collector. Jacqueline works in a dog grooming salon. They are both single and meet through a marriage announcement. Their first interview turns out badly: they find themselves in a porn cinema and argue. Despite this first failure, she agrees to dine with him. However, she goes there with all the dogs of the institute, which the clients could not take back in time.
