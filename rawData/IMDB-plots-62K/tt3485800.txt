Maine Congressman Charlie Winship has had a bad day. After being caught on video failing to stand and recite the pledge of allegiance, he knocks out another House member, confronts his angry ex-wife, and faces denunciation by the media for attacking one of the most cherished patriotic symbols in America. As his life spirals out of control, Charlie embarks on a journey to a remote island in the Atlantic whose eccentric inhabitants are in the middle of a shooting war over their fishing grounds. Treat Williams stars as The Congressman in this humorous and moving film that raises the important question of what it means to be an American.
Newly divorced, battered by the media, betrayed by friends, Maine Congressman Charlie Winship is fed up with Washington and the corruption of the special interest lobbyists. It is only after meeting a group of rugged and self-reliant lobstermen fighting to save their way of life on a remote and beautiful island does Charlie regain the idealism that drew him to Congress while having a second chance at personal happiness.
