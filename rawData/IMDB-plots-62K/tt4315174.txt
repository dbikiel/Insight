Lenz returns to Paris to find his only true love, Madeleine. As his search for her continues, he finds himself getting sucked into the dark and cruel underworld of the porn industry.
Three characters on the cube, or nine possibilities of interaction whose lowest common denominator is always one: the obsession. It is from this unique feeling, destructive, that they evolve, they influence and are determined the lives of Lenz (Kristian Marr), Hélène (Ariane Labed) and Lena (Roxane Mesquida), the three protagonists of a ménage à trois black as pitch , yet tormenting, which takes place at different times and on staggered levels, punctuated by narrative blocks that, little by little, added to each other, give us back in their entirety the ineffable portraits of three souls adrift.
