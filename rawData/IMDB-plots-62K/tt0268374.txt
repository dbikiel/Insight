A shy but very romantic young man tries to meet a girl by walking a borrowed dog. The trick works unbelievably well. They fall in love.
Simon dreams of finding his one true love. Until then, he spends most of his time watching sloppy tearjerkers on video. He also shies away from the shallow young women that he and his friends Micke and Mario meet at bars. But Micke suggests one thing that is a guaranteed babe-magnet: taking a dog out for walks. It's an instant success for Simon, he meets the delightful Mia who immediately takes a liking to him. But things are not always what they may look like.
