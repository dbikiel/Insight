Los Angeles might be the corporate music capital of the world, but it's also the home to America's longest-running underground music scene, a scene that has survived underground 50 years thanks to die hard musicians, promoters and fans of the rebel rock you won't see on MTV. A scene hidden in Hollywood, but never caught on film. Until now.
