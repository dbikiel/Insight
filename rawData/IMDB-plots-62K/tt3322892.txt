Four short horror films that are directed and written by women.
XX is a new horror anthology with a gender twist - all segments will be helmed by female directors and will star female leads. The directors have been given free creative rein within budget and time constraints, but all of the segments themselves will involve the horror genre.
Directed by four different women, "XX" is divided in four segments: (1) "The Box": Near Christmas, Susan Jacobs is going home by subway with her son Danny and her daughter Jenny. There is a man with a box and the nosy Danny asks what it is. The man opens the cover and Danny glances inside the box. From that moment on, Danny does not eat anymore. Six days later, his father Robert Jacobs takes him to the Dr. Weller that can not find reason for the loss of appetite. When Danny tells Jenny the content of the box, she also stops eating. Then they tell to Robert what Danny has seen and he stops eating too. What is the mystery of the box? (2) "The Birthday Party": On the day of her daughter's birthday, Mary finds her husband dead in his office. She tries to hide the body since the guests for the birthday party will arrive soon. Will she succeed? (3) "Don't Fall": Four friends go camping in the wilderness and they find horror in the place. (4) "Her Only Living Son": Cora flees with her son Andy from her husband and lives in a small town. Near the eighteenth birthday of Andy, his behavior changes and he discloses his dark side. What will Cora do?
