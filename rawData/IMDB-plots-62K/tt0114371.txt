A satire about desperate hustling, pop philosophy and big money.
A would-be movie producer strives to convince a self-help guru to let him film his book. As the guru is only interested in money, the producer solicits the help of a shady businessman and the guru's own secretary, who wants to write movie scripts (a horror story about brain-scraping monsters).
