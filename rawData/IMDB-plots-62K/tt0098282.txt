Dave is deaf, and Wally is blind. They witness a murder, but it was Dave who was looking at her, and Wally who was listening.
A man is murdered. Two men witness it. A blind man who hears the killer, and a deaf man who sees them. The police don't think they're credible witnesses, but the killers don't want to take any chances. The two men must now work together to save themselves and bring the killers to justice.
Dave is deaf, Wally is blind. A murder occurs next to the concession stand the two work at. Dave sees the murderer, and Wally hears the murder. The police suspect the duo of killing the man, so it's up to them to find the killer and clear their names.
David Lyons (played by Gene Wilder), a deaf man, runs a convenience store. He recently hired Wally Karue (Richard Pryor), a blind man. A murder is committed in front of the store and both are present but due to their impairments, can't identify the murderer. Moreover, they are the police's prime suspects and are arrested for the murder. They manage to escape but now they have the police and the actual murderers after them.
