In this Western, Alan Ladd exacts revenge on a small town the best way he knows how -- by becoming sheriff.
Mitch Barrett becomes embittered because his wife is allowed to die when he can't pay for the medicine she needs. The remorseful townspeople hire Mitch to be a deputy sheriff, thereby enabling him to plot an elaborate bank robbery with the help of an artist, a pickpocket, a gunslinger and a bar-girl. In conjunction with the robbery, Mitch plans to avenge himself upon every man who hindered his purchase of a single bottle of medicine costing one dollar and eighty seven cents so many years ago.
One of the last films of Alan Ladd( his last the Carpetbaggers in 1964)It's about a man who takes revenge on the town he blames for killing his wife. He manages to become the town sheriff. Then gathering 4 other people who have hit bottom(a drunk, a drifter, a saloon girl and pickpocket) he plans an elaborate robbery to impoverish the town. Little do the other 4 know the sheriff is totally mad and has more than robbery on his mind.
