A boy must reach civilization on a plane for saving his wounded father.
Based on the short story by James Aldridge. Excellent, but elderly pilot Ben agrees to do dangerous underwater shooting for television. Together with his 12-yo son Davy, he flies a light sports plane to Shark Bay. A long time Davy is sitting on the beach. Finally, from the ocean a bloodied Ben appears. The boy hardly can drag his father back to the plane. Ben had only once shown him how to fly a plane. He also had explained that it was the last inch above the ground that mattered if the plane was going to crash while landing or not.
