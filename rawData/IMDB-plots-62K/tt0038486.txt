At odds with Daisy over his personality, Donald hires a look-a-like to make it seem that he's changed for the better. However, the look-a-like soon begins to muscle in on Donald's territory.
Daisy tells Donald he has to improve his English and manners before she'll see him again. Fortunately, an exact double with an English accent, clear speech, and impeccable manners happens by. Donald talks him into posing as Donald, but grows increasingly jealous as Daisy hugs and kisses the stranger.
