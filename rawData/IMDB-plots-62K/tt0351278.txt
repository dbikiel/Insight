Joaquin comes back to Granada in the eighties trying to find out about something happened when he was a child and the Spanish Civil War was going on. He helped an unknown man who survived after being executed. He finds the man, Galapago, who is now quite old, poor and with almost no memory. Joaquin takes care of him and finds hints that point to Galapago as Federico García Lorca.
I saw this Spanish film at the library at Middlebury College when I was working on my M.A. in Spanish. By the end of the film, I was gasping in sobs. It's been nearly 10 years since I've seen this amazing movie so I don't remember all the details, but I will tell you that it was gripping - especially since I've admired García-Lorca forever. As Joaquín works with the homeless old gentleman who has just vague, intermittent memories of his prior life due to a grave injury to his head, there is more and more evidence that the man is indeed Federico García-Lorca. The one scene that stands out for me is when Joaquín brings him to the theatre where they are showing "The House of Bernarda Alba" and you can see on the old gentleman's face intimate recognition of the play. Of course, at the end there's no conclusion as to the man's identity, so it's up to you to decide whether or not this was García-Lorca. I'd rather live believing that Franco's Fascist regime did NOT kill one of the best poets and playwrights of the 20th century.
