After her father's death, Anna Peterson and her family move from Australia to her father's ancestral home in New Zealand. Horses have been an important part of Anna's life and she hopes to keep one at their new ranch. Upon arrival however, the local people are unfriendly and their new home is in need of much repair. Through all this, Anna is fascinated by a wild stallion which roams the countryside and is being hunted by Garrett, a neighbouring rancher.
