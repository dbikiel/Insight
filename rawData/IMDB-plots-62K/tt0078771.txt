Antoine Doinel is now more than thirty. He divorces from Christine. He is a proofreader, and is in love with Sabine, a record seller. Colette, his teenager love, is now a lawyer. She buys Antoine's first published autobiographical novel. They meet again in a station...
Antoine Doinel is having a love affair with the vinyl seller Colette Tazzi. After five years of troubled marriage (with several separations), Antoine and Christine Doinel have a private audience with the judge and conclude an amicable divorce process. His former sweetheart and presently lawyer, Colette Tazzi, sees Antoine leaving the court. She goes to a bookstore to buy his autobiographical novel that was published a couple of years ago. When Antoine goes with Alphonse to the train station he sees Colette on another train, and he jumps from the platform to the train and travels with her. They recall their adolescent love and disclose their sentimental relationships; but when Colette tells how she raises money for her self-support, Antoine is disappointed and seeks out Sabine.
