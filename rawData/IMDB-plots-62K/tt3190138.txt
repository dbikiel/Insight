A father has to go and kill one more time; his son has to deal with the consequences.
Set in Norfolk, amidst an idyllic, brooding landscape, an innocent teenage boy and his battle-weary father live a simple life. Days are spent hunting, fishing and daydreaming. Out-of-nowhere, disrupting this tranquility, a mysterious intense figure gives the green light for the father to complete one last mission; he is a mercenary, hired to assassinate a group of revolutionaries holed-up in a remote, disused civil service outpost. A mission that threatens to destroy not just the compound but the love between a father and his son.
Distinctive, risk-taking British filmmaking. Martin Radich's third feature is a visual and aural treat with a genre twist. Ostensibly a story of father and son involved in political terrorism. Norfolk uses its bucolic setting as a backdrop for revenge, familial breakdown and elemental violence. A disturbed mercenary known only as Man (Denis MÃ©nochet) prepares for one final mission. Only for his plans to be disrupted when his son falls for the girl living with the foreign revolutionaries he is targeting. This strange, often hallucinatory experience blends rural isolation, analogue technology, Rambo and the heavy weight of past tragedy on the present.Set in Norfolk, amidst an idyllic, brooding landscape, an innocent teenage boy and his battle-weary father live a simple life.
