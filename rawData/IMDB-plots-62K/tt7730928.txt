Cheng-hsiang reunites with the members of his high school band and reminisces about their lead singer and his past love, En-pei, whose pursuit of her dreams ended in tragedy. He regrets having encouraged her to pursue her dreams all those years ago, wondering if she would have died if he hadn't done so. Drunk after the memorial and hit by a vehicle, Cheng-hsiang is miraculously transported back to the past, where he sets out to stop En-pei from making the same mistake.
