After a mysterious death of a young college student occurs late one night at a prestigious New England college, Danielle "Daisy" Brooks nevertheless decides to escape her small town life and transfer herself to this prominent school. This naive country girl is determined to start a new life leaving behind a two year relationship and the ghosts of her parents who died nearly three years ago. Daisy knows that she must break away from her past in order move on and find out what she's ultimately made of.
Danielle "Daisy" Brookes is an orphan who leaves her ranch and her boyfriend to pursue her school degree. She is "tapped" by the Ivy Society because the leader of the Ivy Society wants an internship that Daisy is in line for. Later she finds out that they have a killing history that was covered up by the dean, who is also an Ivy. The girls attempt to make Daisy one of them fully, but they fail. She then teams up with the dean's son Blake, to take down the Ivies once and for all. She finally takes them down by taping the leader (Azalea) admitting to her murderous behavior and her attempt to set up Daisy. A fight ensues in the pool, where Daisy pretends to drown and then overpowers Azalea once Azalea thinks she has won.
