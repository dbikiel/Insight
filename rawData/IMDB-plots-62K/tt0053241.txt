With the aid of Merlin, Santa Claus must defeat the evil machinations of the devil Pitch to ruin Xmas.
Santa Claus, high above the North Pole in his cloud-borne castle equipped with more surveillance devices than the Impossible Mission Force, prepares to deliver presents on Christmas night. Santa is especially interested in helping Lupita, the daughter of a poor family who wants nothing more than a doll; and a young boy whose parents are so wealthy they never spend any time with him (Santa fixes this by feeding them Pan-Galactic Gargle Blasters). However, the Devil will have none of this and sends his minion, Pitch, to foil Santa's plans. Pitch in turn recruits three Naughty Boys to help him set traps for Santa.
It's the Christmas season, the time of year when Santa Claus, with the assistance of a number of helpers including some children from around the world, spreads cheers and goodwill to truly good boys and girls regardless of creed, nationality or socioeconomic status. Santa learns that this year, Pitch the Devil, on behalf of his boss Lucifer, is trying to spread evil in making children do bad things on his biding. This battle between Santa and Pitch comes to a head on Christmas Eve, the only day Santa is allowed to come down to Earth, largely but not exclusively in spreading the spirit of what they represent to five children in Mexico City: three young notoriously naughty boys who have the ear of Pitch, do believe in Santa but want to use him for their own selfish purpose; Rico, a good boy from a wealthy family, who has all the toys he wants but who truly wants something immaterial that Santa cannot produce in his Toyland; and Lupita, a good girl from a poor family, she who only wants a doll she can call all her own.
"Pitch", a demon, is sent from Hades to prevent Santa Claus from delivering presents to the good little children of Mexico City. He enlists the help of three brothers.
