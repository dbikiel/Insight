A private eye who suffers total amnesia every twenty-four hours is deeply entangled in a complicated murder and theft case.
Maurice L. Pogue (Dana Carvey) is a private eye with a problem: every morning when he wakes up, he has total amnesia, waking up with a "clean slate". Since he is in the middle of a hot investigation and has a developing romance, this is less than convenient.
