When American submarine Swordfish is torpedoed the survivors are picked up by a passing German U-boat but an outbreak of meningitis threatens all aboard.
At the height of Hitler's infamous U-boat war, the crew of the U.S.S. Swordfish were heading home after months at sea. They never made it. Now prisoners of war aboard U-boat 429, a small group of American survivors will find their loyalties put to the ultimate test when they're forced to join their German captors to fight for their very lives.
U.S.S. Swordfish's green commander, lieutenant commander Randall Sullivan, drills his submarine crew mercilessly to fight the German U-boats. Laid-back chief of boat Nathan Travers submits, but discovers the captain is among the first sufferers of an often fatal, highly contagious nervous infection. The survivors keep quiet about when their boat is sunk and they are picked-up as captives aboard Nazi captain Jonas Herdt's U-boat 429. Casualties at both sides and the perils of war lead to original dilemma's and discord among each crew.
