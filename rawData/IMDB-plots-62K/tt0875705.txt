A desperate young man, on the run from a dangerous drug dealer, returns to his mother, years after a family tragedy drove them far apart, to hide. However, his old and new life are about to collide.
Sissy Spacek, Troy Garity, and music icon Dave Matthews star in this tale of an estranged mother and son who reluctantly come together in hopes of saving their home. Maggie (Spacek) and Billy (Garity) are a desperate mother and damaged son who went their separate ways following a long-ago tragedy.
South African-born singer/songwriter Matthews portrays a drug dealer willing to harm anyone keeping him from recovering cocaine that was stolen from him by Billy's troubled wife.
