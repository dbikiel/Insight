A group of anarchist leftist called "Nada" and led by the terrorist Buenaventura Diaz abducts the American ambassador Richard Poindexter in a brothel in Paris and brings him to a farm in the countryside. The French Minister gives a blank cheque to the violent chief of police Goemond that is assigned to destroy the kidnappers. Then the Minister makes him the scapegoat of the messy situation to protect the State.
French terrorists kidnap the American ambassador, leaving dead and wounded in their wake. Soon they begin quarreling as to his fate, while the police purge suspects in an attempt to destroy the Nada faction. As the violence escalates on both sides, the State and the terrorists are forced to use one another's methods in an increasingly desperate and relentless conflict.
