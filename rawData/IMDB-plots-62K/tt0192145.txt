Two very bored shadowy characters try to think of something to do--and end up playing "Shadow Puppets."
Two bored animated cutouts sit at a table. One is enthusiastic, suggesting things to do: check the TV, see if something's on the radio (five versions of La Cucaracha), play chess. Nothing works to relieve the boredom, including a ring of the door bell. So the enthusiastic one suggests shadow puppets, except that he's not very good, and worse, when his morose partner proves to be a brilliant puppeteer, the bubbly character hasn't a clue to what he's seeing. An argument ensues, ended by the sound of the door bell again. Who could it be?
