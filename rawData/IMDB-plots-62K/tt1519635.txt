Footage collected from a dozen amateur videographers woven into a unique city symphony of social dysfunction.
"At times the news is more dramatic than the movie." This is the theme and intent of Disorder. The movie shows about twenty different actual events without intervention, exposing absurdity and outrage. A madman dancing in the middle of the road without his shirt, pigs blocking people on the roadside, citizens hanging their laundry on city electricity wires, laborers attempting to continue construction even after finding cultural assets in the grounds, policemen beating people and locking them up in squad cars in broad daylight. There is no order that matters. As the title says it, it's complete chaos and disorder.
Shot in the city of Guangzhou, China's third largest city, this independent film made by filmmaker Weikai Huang, shows scene after scene of the gritty and sometimes bizarre happenings of life: pigs running loose on a highway, a mentally ill man dancing in a street as cars go streaming by, a flooded neighborhood where residents slosh through the water, a man complaining to a health inspector about a cockroach in his noodles, cops beating up a man, two guys arguing over counterfeit money. A fascinating look at the underbelly of a big Chinese city, which could very well be Los Angeles or New York. Given the reality TV, as-it-happens nature of the cinematography, it's shot in black and white and is somewhat grainy. 58 minutes long. The citizens in this movie often complain to and about the police and authorities, an image counter to the well-coordinated and cooperative image of the country presented during the Beijing Olympics. There's no narration. The images and real life dialogue with English subtitles speak for themselves.
