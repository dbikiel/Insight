What are adult love affairs ? Two couples meet and fall in love, lose sight of each other in the confusion and end up pulling through.
Story of two comfortable, affably married Parisian couples. When Rachel's jewelry business delivers to her web designer Vincent, their mutual attraction is readily apparent. It isn't long before Rachel invites Vincent and his wife Teri to dinner. Everything is very pleasant, relaxed and shabby-chic, very savoir-vivre. The instant physical chemistry between Teri and Rachel's husband, Franck is also obvious. After they've shared a few drops of wine and a large dose of metaphor, all revolving around a ping-pong table, Teri and Franck kiss. Everyone is mildly shocked, yet more intrigued and they handle it with a rather jejune sophistication. Soon they are regularly putting their sex lives on shuffle, passionately partner-swapping with an abandon that is both respectful and injurious to their ongoing marriages. At first they consensually agree to set no rules and enjoy themselves. As their feelings become more complicated they're forced to question modern relationships, responsibilities and how possible it really is to be in love with more than one person at a time.
