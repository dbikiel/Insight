Three sisters and a group of their friends take a trip to the home of the recently deceased grandfather -- who died a particularly grisly death -- to learn more about the promise of an inheritance, only to encounter a family of psychos who have taken up residence in the old man's cabin.
The Lake sisters - Brielle, Kelly and their step-sister Samantha - receive a surprising inheritance from their unknown grandfather that has just died. Brielle and Kelly join a group of friends and travel in an RV to visit the Lake Motel and decide what to do with the property. Soon they find that their unknown relatives are deranged psychos.
Three sisters venture out to the home of their recently deceased grandfather, along with a few of their friends, to learn more about a possible inheritance, the Lake Motel. Their father begs them not to go, but being teens, they don't listen. They encounter a family living in their grandfather's cabin, which consists of a mom and her three sons, Kane &amp; Abel, who don't speak and never show their faces; and the oldest son Chuck, who is the town's sheriff. Just as their grandfather died a grisly death, so does one of the sisters and two of their friends, leaving only Briell, Kelly and their friend Ben.Briell &amp; Kelly's dad is worried about them and seems to be fighting an inner demon as he debates whether or not to follow them to the family homestead. And we're not sure why that is until Sheriff Chuck has his dimwitted brothers restrain Ben and the two girls, and the true meaning of the term 'family tradition' finally comes to light. While the brothers are securing the kids, Chuck is visiting mom, telling her it's been kind of a bloody mess of things up to this point, but that their plans should work out okay. As Chuck is leaving, Mom asks where her kiss is. And when he nonchalantly walks over and sticks his tongue in her mouth for a passionate kiss, it's pretty apparent at this point that the two grotesque brothers are actually mom &amp; Chuck's sons.Ben and the girls get themselves free and Abel is killed by Kelly in self-defense. Chuck and Kane find him in a pool of blood and go racing to the cop car to hunt down the three kids. Ben manages to mortally wound the other brother, but Sheriff Chuck chases them down, shoots Ben and captures the girls again. Mom shows up to explain that Chuck is really the girls' uncle and that he will be having sex with the two of them so as to preserve the Lake bloodline. She suggests he take one of them up to the barn so that it will be more romantic, just like when the two of them had sex for the first time.Meanwhile, Kelly &amp; Briell's dad, who is Sheriff Chuck's brother, arrives to put an end to the family tradition which he never had any part of. The girls and dad find Ben is still alive and tell him they're taking him to a hospital.As the scene changes and the movie is ending, we see four young people arriving at the deserted Lake Motel. They get out of the car to check it out and see what kind of trouble they can get into. Behind them, in the distance, we see the wounded, but not dead inbred Kane, heading toward them with an axe.************************************************************************************************************************************************************Three sisters, Brielle, Kelli and Sam are on college break. They discover that their grandfather has just died and he has left them a motel in his will. Their father, John tries to persuade them not to go, but the sisters ignore him and head off, accompanied by friends: Tanya , Ben, Bill and Bill's girlfriend, Amy.Sam is the first to arrive, and while drinking wine in Room 6, two inbreds forcefully enter and attack Sam, where with a collection of duct tape, and iron bar, and an axe, they bind Sam's legs with the tape, place the iron bar beside her ankles, and use the axe head to force the bar through both her ankles.Afterwards, the three are in a boat, where the inbreds tie a badly beaten Sam's legs to a concrete block, and dump her into the water, where she is still alive as the concrete block pulls her beneath the water, where she drowns.The rest drive to the motel and meet the caretaker, an old lady who appears kind. After finding a lake on their property, the group of friends take a swim, not noticing that Sam's dead body is floating in the lake beneath them.After the swim, the friends return back to their trailer, where they set up a small campsite. Bill and Tanya go out to the woods to get some firewood, and end up having sex (much to the chagrin of Amy).After encounters with large, strange-looking, unkempt men, the friends are terrified. Bill, Tanya, and Amy are butchered, while the remaining friends escape but are picked up by a mysterious, pushy cop. He tricks them into coming back to the motel where everything slowly falls into place. It is later revealed that the cop and caretaker are all a part of the evil scheme to make Brielle and Kelli a part of their devious plans. The cop and caretaker are in fact son and mother, respectively, and their family has been perpetuated by incest for generations (hence the inbred characteristics of the two aforementioned unkempt men). It becomes apparent that the girls' father had rejected the family "tradition" and escaped; however, their grandmother found out about this and concocted the scheme to lure them to the motel so that her son could forcibly impregnate them and continue the family line.The sisters manage to overcome joining their family's footsteps. Ben seemingly manages to kill both of the inbred men and attempts to rescue the girls from the barn where the cop has taken Brielle to rape her (in the process the grandmother is shot in the head by Ben). When they arrive at the barn Ben is shot unexpectedly by the cop, but the girls' worried father shows up at the last minute and kills his brother, stating "That's how you F*** family", and ending the gruesome tradition.In the end, four teenagers are shown going into the motel to check to see if it is abandoned. One of the teenagers has strange feelings about going into the motel. It turns out that one of the inbreds has survived, and he stares at the girls from behind a tree then screams.
