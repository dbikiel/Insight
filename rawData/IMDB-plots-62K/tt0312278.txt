The story revolves around the legend of the skin walkers or "S Dubs", a folk legend from Utah about the spirits of murdered Indians returning to seek revenge upon those who disrespect the land.
Faced with the murder of three medicine men, Navajo police must find the culprit. That the murders appear to be the work of a Skinwalker, or bad medicine man, complicate and illuminate the detective's work.
When a Navajo Hatalii ("medicine man") is killed, evidence left on the murdered man's truck makes it appear that Detective Lt. Joe Leaphorn (Wes Studi) and Officer Jim Chee (Adam Beach) are on the trail of a "Skinwalker"--a Navajo witch. As the evidence mounts and the case progresses, Leaphorn and Chee occasionally butt heads when Leaphorn's "City Navajo" attitude comes into contact with Chee's traditional upbringing (not to mention Chee's aspiration of becoming an Hatalii himself).Things heat up as it becomes apparent that Chee's uncle (Saginaw Grant) is a potential target... and when Leaphorn's wife, Emma (Sheila Tousey), suffers a resurgence of cancer.Based on the best selling novel by author Tony Hillerman and produced by WGBH for the PBS "American Mystery" series.
