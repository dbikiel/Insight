Working girl Janie is proposed to by a conservative car salesman, a bohemian auto mechanic, and a millionaire playboy and must make a choice.
Working girl/telephone operator Janie is engaged to conservative, dull, but very reliable car salesman Tom, who offers her a safe, stable marriage. Then she meets unconventional slacker Harry, a philosophical car mechanic without much ambition although she does hear bells when they kiss. Through Harry, the fickle Janie meets Dick, a handsome and charming millionaire playboy, who embodies her greatest romantic fantasies, and after a champagne-filled overnight flight to Chicago, she thinks she's met her dream man, but has she?
