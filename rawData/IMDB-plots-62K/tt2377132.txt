After losing election for US Congress, the well spoken Hannah coaches a beer vendor for the position as he, contrary to Hannah, has a likable personality. Can they learn from each other?
This is an update of George Bernard Shaw's "Pygmalion" that changes the genders of the main characters. Hannah Higgins attempts to turn blue-collar Boston beer vendor Elliot Doolittle into a viable candidate and inadvertently learns something of Elliot's side of life.
Boston beer delivery man Elliot Doolittle duly expresses the general public disdain for education consultant Hannah Higgins, whose posh pedantic air lost sympathy and hence a senatorial election. Taking literal her sneer one should learn how to scold in proper English, when a vendor post -lucrative promotion- opens, he turns up, willing to pay for a course. Hannah's firm and campaign deputy Colleen comes up with a better idea: as the spinning team agreed Hannah can't win without vulgarizing way more then she even considers, they should groom naturally agreeable common man Elliot to take her place. The lessons go well, he even accepts after initial fury having been tricked into postulate, for an absurdly inept job, the campaign starts well despite his parasitic mother demanding 'her cut' and giving the Republican opponent an unfair scandal excuse.
