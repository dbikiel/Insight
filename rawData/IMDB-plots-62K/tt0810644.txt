Unsold TV pilot and a dark, violent and gory sword and sorcery spoof set in a postapocalyptic new dark age about a Conan-like barbarian warrior hired to steal a golden goblin from a dangerous wizard who lives in a tower in the sky.
Korgoth is a 22-minute animated parody of the sword and sorcery genre and follows the exploits of the most feared and physically awesome barbarian the world has ever seen. When an unsavory ruffian swings an axe into Korgoth's shoulder, it just makes him angry. And he's irritable and bellicose at the best of times. Korgoth lives in a world of spiteful wizards, overweight inn-keepers, devious and hedonistic thieves and distressed, scantily-clad maidens. Through brute strength, an absolute adherence to the tenets of stoicism, and a fair amount of sheer luck, Korgoth often finds himself coming out ahead of his medieval antagonists.
Tricked by the devious Baron of Thieves, Gog-Ma-Gogg, to ingest a baneful parasite, the legendary warrior of the frozen Barbaria, Korgoth, has no other choice but to lead a motley crew of Gog's hand-picked henchmen to evil wizard Specules' floating castle in the sky. Only by obtaining a precious golden artefact will Korgoth have a chance to live; however, the sorcerer's black magic is so devastatingly powerful, it would take a true medieval hero to get out of there in one piece. Has Korgoth what it takes to eliminate Specules?
