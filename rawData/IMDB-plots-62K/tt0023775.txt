A young woman, sexually exploited all her life, decides to turn the tables and exploit the hapless men at a big city bank - by gleefully sleeping her way to the top.
Lilly (Baby Face) sleeps her way from basement speakeasy bartender, literally floor by floor, to the top floor of a New York office building. Bank sub-manager Jimmy McCoy finds her a job in the bank only to be cast aside as she hooks up with the bank's president. When he complains of not seeing her she says: "I'm working so hard I have to go to bed early every night."
Lily Powers has to do more than serve drinks at her father's run-down speakeasy in a small industrial town, but his death gives her the chance to move on to New York. With her experience in using her looks to get on she is soon on her way to the top, cynically stepping over men as she no longer needs them.
Lily Powers has led a difficult life working in her uncouth father's speakeasy in the small town of Erie, PA. But when her father dies, she finally feels free to try and explore life, and see where it all pulsates from; New York. Having been used for her looks, Lilly now begins to use her looks - and more. Soon, she's on her way to the top, blithely walking over the men she once had to pay umbrage to, as she no longer needs them.
