A young woman sabotages her own wedding in order to reclaim her identity and obliterates her life in the process.
When Eden caves into social and familial pressures to marry Chris, she had no idea she was suppressing negative feelings about marriage until the night before her wedding. The last thing Eden remembers is ripping into one of her wedding presents and downing an entire bottle of scotch. Waking up in the desert beaten nearly to death, Eden has no idea how she got there, but is determined to get herself to the wedding on time. With a broken jaw, she is now a mute ward of the lonely underworld of Los Angeles. Pridefully taking this journey alone, she finds kindness in the most unlikely places.
