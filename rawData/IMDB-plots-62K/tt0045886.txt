The spectacular but tragically short career of magician and illusionist Harry Houdini whose tricks defied explanation and safety.
The amazing career of master magician Harry Houdini is presented from his beginnings with a carnival "wild man" act to his emergence as an internationally-acclaimed illusionist, From his dramatic escape from a locked safe under the frozen Detroit River to an even more improbable one from a locked cell in Scotland Yard, he never failed to please and astound his audiences. Although Houdini's tricks are achieved through his marvelous physical dexterity and innate sleight-of-hand, he courted death with the hazardous illusions he performed and his compulsive quest to make contact with the spirit world.
In this fictional account of the great magician's life, Houdini meets his wife Bess while performing sideshow . The demure Bess rebuffs his advances but is soon attending all of his shows and they are married after a whirlwind romance. His first attempt at performing on stage with Bess as his pretty assistant is less than successful and he decides to take a regular job in a lock factory. His escape from a straight jacket at the annual magicians dinner gets him a ticket to Europe where he becomes a great success, even meeting a challenge to escape from London's reputedly escape-proof jails. Back home he stages a series of death defying escapes but turns to mysticism after his beloved mother's death. He eventually returns to great acclaim but dies on stage after accidentally aggravating an inflamed appendix.
