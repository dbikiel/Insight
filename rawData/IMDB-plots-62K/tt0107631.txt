Two Manhattan slacker dudes, best friends, want to make a movie about their lives. Splick drives a hack, Jason tends bar; each has a stuttering relationship with a down-to-earth woman. But neither has a clue how to make a movie. A friend in the industry sets up meetings for them with producers, which they blow. Things look up when Phoebe Cates and Martha Plimpton agree to star, but then they leave the city for other projects. Splick and Jason argue. Things look bleak. Will they repair their friendship? Will they reconnect to their lovers?
