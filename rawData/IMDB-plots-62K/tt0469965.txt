While he's deep undercover in New York, DEA agent Shane Tanner, the son of a legendary cooler named Dalton, learns that his uncle Nate Tanner got beat up by a group of men because he doesn't want to sell the Black Pelican, his bar in Tyree, Louisiana. Shane takes off for Louisiana to find out who attacked Nate. Shane decides to stay in Nate's house for the time being, and run the Black Pelican in Nate's absence, much to the dismay of former Black Pelican cooler Bill "Wild Bill" Decarie. Wild Bill wants to buy the Black Pelican since it's located in a prime location for running drugs. The Black Pelican is close to the border, it's between Florida and Texas, and it's in an area where drugs can be smuggled pretty much undetected. But Shane doesn't want to sell, and damages the numerous thugs that Bill sends his way. Also, Dalton was murdered years ago, and Shane still wonders who killed Dalton. When Shane was a rookie state trooper in Tyree, Shane had come home from work one night, and found Dalton fatally shot. After that, Shane left town and became a DEA agent. Now, Wild Bill's boss, Miami crime syndicate kingpin Victor Crost, decides that it's time to handle matters personally, because Wild Bill's men are not doing a good job of it. Shane is soon faced with impossible odds and a low number of staff members at the Black Pelican. To rid Louisiana of Victor, Wild Bill, and their organization, Shane teams up with local school teacher Beau Hampton, who is a regular at the Black Pelican.
