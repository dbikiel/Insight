Police Inspector Samar Pratap Singh is transferred to Motihari, in the Indian state of Bihar, along with his wife, Manjari and a daughter. He is honest and diligent and these attributes sets him up against his superior - the District Superintendent of Police, as well as his subordinates and fellow officers. His diligence in maintaining law and order, and his belief in justice for all, regardless of one's background, makes him a powerful enemy in the shape and form of Bachu Yadav who is the local MLA of the ruling political party, and will not stop at anything to get rid of Samar and his family, by hook or by crook, and no one will dare to stop him.
Samar Pratap Singh (Manoj Bajpai) is an honest police officer, and Manjari (Raveena Tandon) his supportive wife. They have a little daughter Sonu. Samar, because of his honesty is frequently being transferred, and has now finally reached the little town of Motihari in Bihar. Motihari's lord and master, so to speak, is slimy MLA Bachu Yadav (Sayaji Shinde). The police and most of Samar's colleagues kowtow to Yadav . The epitome of corruption, Yadav has been the MLA for 15 years, but loses his ticket as his party opts for someone else. On hearing this ,Yadav makes short shrift of the unfortunate man, and avails himself of the party ticket. Samar, an honest cop, has frequent run-ins with Yadav, to the point where he (Samar) begins to fear for his family. Does Samar manage to take on Yadav and win ?
