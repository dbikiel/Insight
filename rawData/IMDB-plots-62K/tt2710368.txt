A gritty, international tale of four separate stories woven together by a common theme: the Rapture.
Breathtaking, gripping, layered, and astonishing, FINAL is a gritty, international tale of four separate stories woven together by a common theme: the Rapture. In Los Angeles, Colin Nelson desperately attempts to flee to Bora Bora. Keenly aware that he's in the Tribulation period, his only hope is in a mysterious man named Frankie. In Tokyo, a covert agent, Masashi, tries to unravel the disappearance of millions of people as the government closes in on him. In Rio De Janeiro, Marie searches for her final relative as time runs out. And on a deserted island in the South Pacific, Tom Wiseman, an avowed atheist, attempts to be rescued after his plane goes down. Bold in scope, FINAL will captivate you from the very first page to the stunning, tear-jerking end.
