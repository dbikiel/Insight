A sports store clerk poses as a famous jockey as an advertising stunt, but gets more than he bargained for.
Mr. Mason is a salesman at Detridge &amp; Frome who wants to advertise their line of riding clothes. Since they have the rights to famous jockey Peter Randall, who is in Australia, Peter will impersonate him at the Steeple Chase. At the event, he is invited to a party by Cora and sees young Ellen. Since all Ellen and Peter have in common is horses, he continues the charade to woo her. But two gamblers named Maxie and Duke, try to make money on the race by fixing him up with the wild 'Jeepers Creepers'. That horse can jump high and run like the wind, but he will only calm down enough to be ridden when Gabriel plays his trumpet.
