An island Princess falls for a visiting Frenchman, but her people are against it.
André Laurence accompanies his college roommate, Tenga, back to Tenga's Polynesian island home. There, André assumes the native life and, after many trials with the native customs and their suspicions, marries his friend's sister, Kalua. Their marriage is barren of children. A final blow to André comes with the eruption of a volcano, and the island's holy man, the Kahuna, decides that the volcano can only be appeased with the sacrifice of Kalua.
