A Police Commissioner's son comes under suspicion for being a jewel thief.
Vinay, an ordinary young man who finds himself constantly mistaken for a look-alike jewel thief named Amar. Vinay works with the police to impersonate Amar and crack his crime ring--but it seems that Amar has decided to impersonate Vinay, as well, and soon their true identities are thoroughly muddled.
With Bombay being held to ransom by a daring jewel thief, the Police Commissioner has not only his hands full, but is also upset with his son, Vinay, as he has not learned any skills, and spends all his time examining stones and jewelery. He is pleased after Vinay secures employment with a leading jeweler, Vishamber Nath, and subsequently falls in love with his daughter, Anju. Then several people greet Vinay as "Amar" or "Prince Amar", and things come to a boil when a woman named Shalini comes forward and claims that Vinay is her fianc√©e. Vinay is able to prove that he is indeed Vinay, and cooperates to locate this elusive Amar - only to find himself embroiled in a devious scheme - that not only robs him of his sanity, his memory, identity, and makes him a target of every policeman in India and Nepal.
