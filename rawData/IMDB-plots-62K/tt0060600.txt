(1967) Tony Kendall, Brad Harris. Two Yanks are hired to protect a rich lady from a sinister underworld group. Lots of jungle thrills, martial arts, ancient temples, huge explosions, &amp; even sci-fi elements. Watch for Harris' great karate fight inside a crumbling temple, surrounded by masked members of an ancient sect. A cross between James Bond and Indiana Jones. 16mm.
The crime-fighting duo journey to Ceylon to tangle with murder, kidnaping, extortion and the threat to unleash a deadly bacteria. Soon they're tangling with a deadly group called "Three Yellow Cats" and their leader, King, in a karate fight to the death!
