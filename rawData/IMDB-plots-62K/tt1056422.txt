A drama steeped in Portugal's Fado music culture.
Having taken on flamenco ("Sevillanas") and tango ("Tango"), Carlos Saura tackles a third great melancholy music style, directing "Fados," a celebration of Portugal's classic, lamenting acoustic folk songs. The film combines fado performances from top artists, dance from Portugal, Brazil and Cape Verde and archive footage. In the song centrepieces, artists deliver contemporary versions of fado classics. Lined up fadistas include young female star Mariza as well as Grammy award-winner Carlos do Carmo. Renowned diva Am√°lia Rodrigues is remembered through arquive footage while the exploration of fado's influences and roots gives opportunities to embrace prestigious Brazilian performers Caetano Veloso, Chico Buarque and the emerging Cape Verdean star Lura.
