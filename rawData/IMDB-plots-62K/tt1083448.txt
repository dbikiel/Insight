At the invitation of an estranged relative, a young woman travels with her niece and nephew to a castle in Europe for Christmas, where she unwittingly falls for a dashing Prince.
Jules Daly is struggling to raise her orphaned niece and nephew (Maggie and Milo) alone, but it isn't easy after getting downsized out of her antique sales job while Milo rebels against the death of his parents through petty theft. With things looking bleak for Christmas, an English butler named Paisley arrives with an invitation for all to come see the kids' emotionally distant grandfather who lives in Castlebury Hall, somewhere near Liechtenstein. With nothing to hold them back, they go, but the grandfather, Edward, Duke of Castlebury, is rather cold over their visit to his castle. So is his other surviving son, Ashton, Prince of Castlebury. Before long, they're all having a good time and looking forward to hosting a Christmas Eve ball, but Jules overhears a conversation from which she draws a wrong conclusion.
Christmas is right around the corner and Jules Daly (McGrath) is doing her best to create a loving home as new guardian to her mischievous niece and nephew. But when she loses her job and an exasperated nanny on the same day, a mysterious and unexpected invitation arrives - travel to Europe and spend a royal Christmas with the children's distant grandfather - the Duke of Castlebury Hall (Moore)! It's a new world for Jules and the children as they discover their new prim and proper surroundings in the castle, but soon laughter begins to echo in the once quiet halls, filling everyone with renewed hope and joy for the season. And when Jules captures the heart of the dashing Prince Ashton (Heughan), both of their lives begin to change in unexpected ways! Featuring a faraway land, an enchanting romance and the unbreakable bonds of family, this inspirational tale is sure to become a new holiday tradition!
