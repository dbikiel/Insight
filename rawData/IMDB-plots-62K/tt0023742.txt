While romancing a beautiful Russian countess, a captain in the Austrian intelligence service is assigned to capture "K-14", a clever spy who has so far managed to remain undetected. What the captain doesn't know is that he is actually closer to the spy than he realizes.
On the 1st of August, 1914 the booking hall of Luxembourg Station is thronged with people anxious before the war which that day had been declared between Russia and Germany---a war doomed to engulf most of the other countries of Europe and eventually America as well---became an accomplished fact. A beautiful girl named Carla Vanitska---but that was not the name on her passport asked the agent for a ticket to Vienna and was informed there would be no trains to Austria. She settled for a ticket to Berne and her bank note was refused as the station was taking only gold or silver. It was then that a young Austrian Intelligence Officer, Captain Rudolph Ritter (Gilbert Roland), on assignment to find a Russian spy known only as K-14, stepped forward and helped her out of her predicament. The next time he saw her, she was posing as a Red Cross nurse but he was already too much in love to suspect her....till she walked right into a trap of his setting.
