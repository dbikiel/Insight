A serial killer begins the process of grooming a protégé, until outside influences threaten to destroy their sadistic relationship.
Serial killer Wayne Montgomery was inadvertently "outed" in December 2006, after DNA evidence linked him and his wife Andrea to a series of brutal unsolved murders in the small town of Claymont, Delaware - as well as the disappearance of their own daughter Monica. However, Andrea was the only one arrested. Authorities were unable to locate Wayne, who had simply vanished. Countless hours of Wayne &amp; Andrea's home footage, allegedly depicting several of these vicious acts being committed, had also vanished. Recently discovered footage recorded by Wayne in 2007 details his activities in the months following his wife's arrest - adjusting to his life as a fugitive...and beginning a sadistic, twisted relationship with a teenage male hustler named Jared, whom Wayne has selected to groom as a successor. However, things will soon become unraveled when outside influences threaten to destroy the foundation that Wayne has created for his young student.
