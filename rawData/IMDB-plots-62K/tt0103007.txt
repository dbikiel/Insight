Karma comes into play when a wealthy wisecracking landlord is ordered by a court to live in the filthy building that he runs.
Louie is a New York City slum landlord who is given 120 days to repair one of his apartment blocks. The problem for Louie is that he must live in the rundown block until the repairs are complete. Louie's father is the real boss, and he has no intention of paying for the repairs. This leaves Louie to live in the squalor his tenants endure all year round.
