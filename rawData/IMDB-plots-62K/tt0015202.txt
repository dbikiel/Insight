The pianist Paul Orlac is on tour and his wife Yvonne Orlac anxiously waits for his return. While traveling back home, there is a train wreck at Montgeron and Orlac is very injured in both hands in the accident. Yvonne begs to Dr. Serral to save his hands which are his life. Meanwhile, the robber and murderer Vasseur, who claims to be innocent, is sentenced to death since the police investigator had found his fingerprints everywhere near the victim. Dr. Serral transplants Vasseur's hands in Orlac and when he recovers, he feels that there is something wrong with his hands. Orlac asks the surgeon about the hands and learns that he belonged to a criminal, and Orlac decides to never touch Yvonne again with those hands. His family becomes poor since he is not working anymore and Yvonne pays a visit to her father-in-law to ask for help. However, Orlac's father is a cruel man and does not help her. When Orlac returns home, Yvonne asks him to visit his father and when he arrives at his house, he finds his father dead. They call the police and they find Vasseur's fingerprints everywhere. Orlac is the only heir of his father's fortune but soon he is followed by a stranger named Nera who blackmails him and demands a small fortune. Orlac is not sure that he killed his father and goes with Yvonne to the police. Soon they discover a secret about Vasseur.
