A young singer struggles with his sexuality and the treatment of others while coming of age in a small Southern Baptist community.
The movie about a teen who is battling with his sexuality. His two closes friends find out and are cool with it but the female friend is teased because she's a virgin. The two eventually have sex together so that she could lose her virginity to someone she knew cared about her and he so that he could make sure that he was actually gay. He then goes to this school to audition for a play only to find out that the star of the play is also gay and develops a crush on him. The main character is torn between all the bible beating the mom ( actor Monique) preaches to him and his urge to find love with a man. Later in the movie, he starts making out with him in front of his home and his mother comes out and catches him. She drags him out of the car and into the house humiliating him in front of his friend. He later goes to meet with the guy and has his first sexual experience with him. Towards the end of the movie the daughter is found alive and the son brings home his "boyfriend" and introduces him to the family. The movies so all over the place and the ending is the entire time.... He was dreaming. The role that Monique plays is of a mother mourning the death of her young daughter and she blames her son for her disappearance. She is also not excepting of his sexuality and blames it on the disappearance of her daughter.Her role does not show her range nor does it really show how or why she is the way she is. No plot.The movie lacks substance and it a little all over the place. The main actor needs a lot more coaching with his acting. Monique's role and acting is marginal to other roles she's been in. It's a typical church vs homosexuality movie. Another after school special.
