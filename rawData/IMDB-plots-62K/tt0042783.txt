A dancer who has just gotten engaged to her partner and choreographer and is about to embark on a major career is devastated to learn that she has contracted polio.
After countless hours of rehearsal to perfect their routines and years of struggling to get bookings, dance duo Guy Richards and Carol Williams, who are also a couple off the stage, are enjoying some success on the nightclub circuit, enough for them to make longer term plans, such as thoughts of imminent marriage. Their road to happiness hits a major bump when Carol, falling ill, is taken to the hospital, where she is diagnosed with polio. The prognosis for polio is good: with hard work and patience, she may be able to walk again, with even a slim possibility that she will one day be able to dance. She is admitted to an institution specializing in rehabilitation for polio patients. Beyond the fear both Guy and Carol have for her overall health, they, still loving each other, may not be able to survive as a couple because of the illness due to feelings of guilt and resentment. Carol, in addition, may fall into a feeling of inferiority, only being able to associate with people who are like her. In this regard, she may end up mistaking being in love with love out of emotional need. Only true role models may be able to show both Carol and Guy that they can lead a happy life as a couple.
