24 hours in the bitter life of a frustrated divorced teacher who stays in the vicious circle of his numerous obsessions.
It is a bitter story about a middle-aged man who hates his life, other people and ultimately himself. Adam Miauczynski, the character known from director Marek Koterski's previous films, is a 49 year-old teacher who reads poetry during school lessons and later goes home swearing and calling his neighbours' names. The worst pain for him is the next 5 minutes of living. He doesn't accept himself and even everyday contacts with others cause his aggression. Though constantly dreaming of a romantic love, he is not bold enough to make his dreams come true.
