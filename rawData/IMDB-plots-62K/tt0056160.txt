On Hitler's birthday, the Germans decide to organize a soccer match between prisoners of war and Germans. They assign the task of organizing the team to a well known Olympics football player who demands for his team food and a chance to train. Although the organizer believes that soccer is sacred and does his best to train the team, he is tempted to escape along with the others, when they find an opportunity. They get caught, but the game takes place anyway. They play, hoping that they might get pardoned and not get executed in the end. However, they play too well and the enraged Germans execute them before the game ends.
