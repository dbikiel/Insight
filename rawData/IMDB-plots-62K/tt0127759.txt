A stolen computer floppy disc filled with information about the location of a mythical treasure in Savage Island will lure both villains and L.E.T.H.A.L. Agents into a dangerous treasure hunt.
A stolen computer disk contains the location of a hidden treasure trove. It's up to the sexy ladies of LETHAL (Legion to Ensure Total Harmony and Law) to find the treasure before the bad guys do. Will the forces of evil be able to overcome LETHAL's powerful combination of bullets, brains, and boobs?
The L.E.T.H.A.L. Agency has successfully deployed a deep space crime-detection satellite and somewhere in Hawaii, at the KSXY Radio station, undercover Agent Ava watches the progress. Meanwhile, back at the Agency's headquarters, a seductive woman disguised as a pizza delivery employee, infiltrates the building and manages to steal an important computer floppy disc filled with information about the location of a mythical treasure. Once again, in Savage Island, the treasure will lure both villains and L.E.T.H.A.L. Agents who now use the assistance of a previous foe: the "Warrior". In the end, will Agents Cobra and Tiger succeed in their dangerous treasure hunt against the vicious Rodrigo Martinez and his deadly ninjas?
