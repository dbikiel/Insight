A hysterical documentary which uses footage of Ed Wood's movie to tell the story of his life. It may not be a deep analysis, but shows distinctly how Ed's life strongly influenced his own films.
A thorough biography of Ed Wood, as told by his wife Kathy, ex-girlfriend Dolores Fuller, right hand man Conrad Brooks, among others. Clears up many false-truths that were stated in Burton's "Ed Wood" (1994).
