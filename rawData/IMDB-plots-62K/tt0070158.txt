A would-be criminal is taken in by a professional in the game, who teaches him how pickpockets work in teams.
In Seattle, aspiring pickpocket Ray is not very adept at his chosen profession. He thinks he's made it to the big time when he learns that a "cannon" - a pickpocket - is looking for an apprentice. The cannon is Harry, recently arrived in Seattle, with his older associate, Casey, a man with a penchant for cocaine. What Harry and Casey are really looking for is a "stall" - someone to act as the distractor. Harry thinks Sandy, Ray's girlfriend (and one of his former marks), is better suited to the job, but, Sandy will not do it unless Ray's included, as well. Ray appreciates what Harry can and does teach him and Sandy, but, Ray doesn't much like the romantic and sexual interest Harry' starts showing in Sandy. Harry's number one rule; Harry never holds, and after relocating their operation to stay one step ahead of the law, Ray's tired of being the 4th musketeer in the group, and itches to become a world-class cannon himself. This doesn't fit within Harry's grand scheme, and allegiances between each of the individuals within the foursome are tested.
