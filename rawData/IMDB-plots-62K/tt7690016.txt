Jessie and Angela, high school dropouts in love, are taking a week off to chill at the beach. Too bad their house got robbed, rent's due, they're about to get fired, and they're broke. Now they've gotta avoid eviction, stay out of jail and get to the beach, no matter what.
When Angela recklessly spends all their rent money on a suprise trip to the beach for her girlfriend Jessie's 17th birthday, the two high school drop outs think scraping by this month will be as easy as picking up some extra shifts at the diner... Or so they thought. The two lovers embarked on an adventure to come up with the money and will stop at nothing till they make it to the beach.
