Dr. Jimmy Kildare is back at work at Blair General hospital, though several people admit that he is not himself since suffering his loss. He's taken a liking to a young intern, Don Winthrop, and tries to help him out when he transports an accident victim, socialite Cynthia "Cookie" Charles, to Blair General from outside the hospital's agreed territory. When the other hospital complains, Winthrop is fired. Soon after, his girlfriend, Nurse Anabelle Kirke, is also let go when she too misapplies hospital policy. Kildare pleads their case with the hospital Board but with little luck. He then gets the well-connected Cookie, who has a thing for him, to help to sort it out
