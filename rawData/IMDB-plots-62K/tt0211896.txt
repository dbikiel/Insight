Parrot, Monkey and Elephant are excited to understand how long their friend Boa is. They finally arrive to the result, though it is measured in quite a strange fashion.
A quartet of dissimilar friends: an energetic monkey with a blue bow, a timid little elephant with glasses, a speechless parrot without a tail and a philosophizing boa with an excess tail - they are looking for the most atypical solutions for typical life tasks. Measure the length of a boa constrictor and cure him of an invented disease, teach the parrot to fly, and the monkey to get coconuts from the trees, understand the basics of good behavior, arithmetic, physical laws - Friends can create a whole adventure from scratch, because they should learn the world.
