In an effort to feel better, she reconnects with her half-sister Grace, (Lauren Fales) and, inspired by a new boyfriend (Brian Rieger), sets out on a quest to find someone to help. Though excited and hopeful when she meets an eccentric woman named Maria (Karen Black), she soon discovers Maria is a compulsive hoarder, and is swept up in a situation more emotionally and morally complicated than she had expected to find. Inspired by a true story.
