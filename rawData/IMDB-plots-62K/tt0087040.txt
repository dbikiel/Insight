A talented, but doomed, gentleman tries to participate in a properly British game of charades.
Two men are introduced to the popular parlor game, charades. They are solely given the task of acting out the clues. The two men take decidedly different approaches to the game, with differing results. The lack of success for one is just too much for him to handle.
Have you ever tried to guess a word in a game of charades while a friend in the party struggles to mime it? During a game of charades, one man who competes before an enthusiastic, yet utterly uninspired audience, tries way too hard to act out his words, however, the crowd's lack of imagination is appallingly frustrating.
