A Civil War-era secret agent with an extraordinary special power serves under president Abraham Lincoln.
Enlisted in President Abraham Lincoln's secret service, the amazing agent Screw-On Head is the bravest and most dedicated operative, even though at first glance, he is nothing more than a disembodied mechanical head. However, with the exotic ability to screw itself onto a wide variety of robotic bodies, the Head is eager to accept missions his human colleagues don't even dare to pursue. Along with his faithful valet, Mr Groin, Screw-On Head goes on a mission to save America against the ghastly Emperor Zombie and his evil plan to unleash an ancient Demigod on earth. Can the mechanical super-spy foil the megalomaniac's schemes?
