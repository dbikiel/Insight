Zambrano is a juvenile offender that when arrives to the penitentiary only longs to join a football team, Los Perros. Such illusion ends up involving him with the organized crime under the auspices of the authority, because the team is also the 4th Company, a squad of inmates that controls services and privileges in prison, and submits the city to crime, reporting big dividends to men of Power.
A rare Mexican cinema gem inspired by real events. Shot in the naturalistic style of City of God the directors cast actual inmates from the Mexico Distrito Federal penitentiary. La Cuarta Compania is a raw look into the inner workings of the prison in the late 70's early 80's that has not changed much to this day. The film recounts the story of Mexico's first American football league where inmates turned athletes were coerced by the authorities to commit crimes while "on pass". This film was not well received by the government since it may have struck a chord to those in power.
