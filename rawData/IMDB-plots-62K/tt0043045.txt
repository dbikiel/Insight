Three women who secretly gave their new-born sons up for adoption in 1945, wonder if the 5-year old survivor of a plane crash, named in the local newspapers, is their long-abandoned son.
A five-year-old boy is the sole survivor of a devastating plane crash in the mountains of California. When the newspapers reveal the boy was adopted and that the crash occurred on his birthday, three women begin to ponder if it's the son each gave up for adoption. As the three await news of his rescue at a mountain cabin, they recall incidents from five years earlier and why they were forced to give up their son.
