Set in the 1950s Italian countryside, the film tells the story of Lola and Masetto, a young couple whose views on premarital sex differ drastically.
In verdant 1950s rural Italy, the seductively charming bride-to-be, Lola, has no intention of walking down the aisle as a spotless virgin. On the other hand, her traditional bread-baker fiancé, Masetto, has other plans, insisting on deflowering his beloved chosen one not earlier than the night of their wedding. However, Lola is impatient, and above all, unsatisfied--and under those circumstances--she never misses an opportunity to flaunt her smooth, well-rounded derrière, while riding her bicycle. Now, wild curiosity turns into bottled-up sexuality, inflaming Lola's fervent desires. Without a doubt, the untamed Lola knows what she wants, and she wants it now. Can Masetto stop her?
Lola is engaged to Masetto, but simply will not commit until they sleep together, because she suspects the only reason he keeps her a virgin is to ensure that she was faithful to him until to wedding. Constantly annoyed by Masetto's fits of jelous rage, Lola decides to break up with him and soon develops an attraction to her mother's pornographer boyfriend, but she simply can't get over her love for Masetto.
