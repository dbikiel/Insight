The recently widowed Mary Stuart returns to Scotland to reclaim her throne but is opposed by her half-brother and her own Scottish lords.
Mary Stuart returns to Scotland to rule as queen, to the chagrin of Elizabeth I of England who finds her a dangerous rival. There is much ado over whom Mary shall marry; to her later regret, she picks effete Lord Darnley over the strong but unpopular Earl of Bothwell. A palace coup leads to civil war and house arrest for Mary; she escapes and flees to England, where a worse fate awaits her.
Fictionalized account of Mary Queen of Scots from her return to Scotland in 1561 to her execution in 1587. Her return is not welcomed by all of the Scottish Lords and many are suspicious of her Catholic religion and her private secretary, Rizzio. She does get support from some quarters, including Lord Bothwell with whom she falls in love. Her Council however force her to marry her foppish cousin Lord Darnley and she later gives birth to a son, James. She is eventually forced out and seeks refuge with England's Queen Elizabeth only to find that she is her prisoner. After many years, she is executed.
