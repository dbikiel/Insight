Non-linear film tells the sexual story of a film director from his life at age 5, 12 and 16, a man embarking on his first film in 1950s Tunisia, and finally to his current life. Along the way, as a teen, he has sexual exploits with an older woman, gets involved with an Italian couple in Tunisia that culminates in the killing of a local boy and the brutal revenge murder of the woman and, ultimately, is married to a cold woman.
