The daughter of bankmanager Modesto Pardo (played by Antonio Resines) dies in an forest fire while camping. 7 years later Pardo's bank gets robbed and robbers break open numerous safe deposit boxes. After the robbery, Pardo looks by mistake into one of the depositboxes and stumbles across some very strange documents that prove that his daughter's death is not an accident but murder. Pardo swears to take revenge on all those involved but doesn't know that papers belong to a very powerful mob boss who is looking for the papers and will stop at nothing to get them.
