There was a famous Soviet movie of the 1950s in which a character says, 'I don't much care if there is life on Mars.' But there are still people who look up into the sky wondering if Earth is not the only planet inhabited by some form of life. This extraordinary film may sound like a piece of science fiction, but it is a story that happened near a small village in the Chernobyl area soon after the devastating explosion of the nuclear power plant. A police officer finds a strange creature in a house inhabited by a crazy old woman. He takes it home and, despite his wife's objections, puts it into the refrigerator. According to the rules, he reports the case to his superiors and arranges for the creature to be examined. This is only the beginning of the story, however - soon afterwards his wife leaves him, the old woman dies under mysterious circumstances, a ufologist comes to the village to investigate, and to crown it all, the officer is haunted by apparitions. Enigmatic and inexplicable things in our lives - are we ready and able to face them? If so, do we 'need' extraterrestrials?
