An exploration of the making of b-movie sci-fi cult classic "The Creeping Terror" and its con-man director Art "A.J." Nelson/Vic Savage.
At first watch most viewers find many of the sequences in The Creeping Terror so unbelievably awful and ineptly executed that the movie transcends the sci-fi and horror genres and delves into the realm of comedy. But the story behind the film contains all of the elements of classic movie-making that director Art Nelson would have killed to have in The Creeping Terror. It's the sci-fi Ed Wood told by the actual people who helped bring The Creeping Terror to life, recounting the desperate tales of Art Nelson by those who knew him best. There are rather elegantly produced scenes to set up the actual, and hilarious, footage from The Creeping Terror, also included in CREEP! The real monster was behind the camera.
The Creep Behind the Camera was an actual filmmaker named Vic Savage; a real scumbag whose only real skill was in his uncanny ability to convince the residents of 1960 Glendale, California that he was making the biggest, the BEST monster movie ever made! The true story of Vic Savage, aka Art Nelson and the making of his monster opus The Creeping Terror (1964) is told in the narrative dark-comedy The Creep Behind the Camera. A hilarious and wholly disturbing look at human nature and delusional demagoguery, The Creep Behind the Camera is a roller coaster ride that takes a nostalgic but cautionary look at the era of drive-in cinema at its very worst.
