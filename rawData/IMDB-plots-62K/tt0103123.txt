In the early 1980s, football star Ricky Bell befriends Ryan Blankenship, a disabled boy.
A poignant story in the mode of "Brian's Song" and "Something for Joey". This is the tale of Ricky Bell, an all-pro running back with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who died of a rare muscle disease in the prime of his career. The plot centers on Bell's relationship with a father-less handicapped boy, and his efforts to be a big brother to him. The boy ends up being an inspiration for Bell when his disease makes the athlete more afflicted than the boy.
