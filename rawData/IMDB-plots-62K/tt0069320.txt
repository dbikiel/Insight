A traveling salesman is lured by a precocious teenage girl to her shack in the desert for some sexual escapades. However, a scuzzy biker comes along and they both find themselves dominated and tormented by him.
While traveling to L. A., a traveling salesman picks up a young, unwashed woman and gives her a ride to her shack out in the middle of the desert. As he tries to leave, the lonely girl takes an axe and breaks his leg, confining him to her bed. As he alternately demands and begs for a doctor, she tries to convince him to stay and live with her. After several escape attempts go awry, the odd couple is visited by a sleazy biker who had previously raped her, and is now looking for her dead grandfather's hidden gold. He threatens the girl and the bedridden salesman with violence if they don't comply. Finally, the girl tells him where he can find the gold, and then rides off with him. Faced with the prospect of being left alone, nearly helpless, the salesman repairs his car and drives off. Seeing the girl on the side of the road, he foolishly stops to try and help her, only to discover that she has killed the biker. After rejecting his offers of help, she attacks him with a knife, subsequently reinjuring his leg in the struggle. Stumbling to the road for help, she is questioned by the police who find the dead biker and the injured salesman. Faced with the prospect of losing her freedom, the movie ends with the girl accusing the salesman of the murder.
