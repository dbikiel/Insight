A carefree afternoon at the beach turns into a comic misadventure when three young Japanese men are mistaken for illegal Korean residents.
Three students spend their holidays at the seaside where they are mistaken for Koreans, a minority which is looked down on in Japan. The action develops into a crime story.
One day three young men (played by Japanese band The Folk Crusaders) wander to the beach for a swim. While swimming in the ocean, someone steals their clothes and leaves other outfits in their place. Not wanting to walk around naked, the young men try on these new clothes and wander back towards town. Suddenly they are pursued by police, who think they are Korean criminals. Confused and unaware of their mistaken identities, the young men run from the police and eventually bump into the real "criminals".
