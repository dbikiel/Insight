At the height of his fame, Oscar Wilde angers the Marquis of Queensberry by having what is (correctly) believed to be a romantic relationship with Queensberry's son Lord Alfred Douglas ("Bosie"), who is twenty years Wilde's junior. When Queensberry slanders Wilde, the artist decides to take the matter to court and brings about his own downfall.
Having just finished reading two major works on Wilde, I can verify that this movie takes great care to adhere to historical accuracy in covering the relationship between Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas ("Bosie"), as well as Wilde's trials for "gross indecency." Great reliance is placed on authentic materials such as letters and trial transcripts.
