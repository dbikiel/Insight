London has always been a source of influence, inspiration and curiosity. Paul Kelly and Kieran Evans' FINISTERRE tries to identify the dreams that London holds for so many, and the reality of the city -- the spaces between the landmarks, the spaces Londoners inhabit. Presented and scored by Saint Etienne, the film takes us on a journey from the suburbs into the heart of the city over an imaginary 24 hours. Along the way we hear from characters that have influenced or been a part of the Saint Etienne story. FINISTERRE features the observations and reminiscences of Lawrence from Felt/Denim, Mark Perry, the editor of original punk fanzine Sniffin' Glue, as well as Vic Godard from Subway Sect and artist Julian Opie, folk singer Vashti Bunyan, London-centric author Shena Mackay, and Nick Sanderson from Earl Brutus. Through the interviews and imagery we see London from an insider's perspective. The result is a hymn to London, and an extraordinary record of the city today. Digitally shot and edited, FINISTERRE evolved alongside the Saint Etienne album of the same name. Initially conceived as a way of channelling the money allocated for music videos into something more substantial, it became in every sense an independent production. Its development is unique: early sequences were projected as visuals behind the band during their latest tour, while the film played recently to cinema audiences in London and Tokyo.
