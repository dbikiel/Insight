At the beginning of the film, you can see the reproduction of Ivan Shishkin's famous painting "Morning in a Pine Forest" with the name of the studio below. After a few seconds, a thunderous sound with a flash is heard, everything is getting dark, the cubs are running away, and the bear falls and rolls, and then the name of the cartoon appears on the background and a bearish roar sounds. The bear sleeps in its den. His nightmarish dreams are periodically interrupted by an annoying mosquito.
