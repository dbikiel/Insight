Various photographers and employees of Polaroid recount their experiences with the company's instant film in its final year of production.
In February 2008, Polaroid announced that it was ceasing production of instant film. 'Time Zero' is a documentary that tells the story of the last year of Polaroid film in three acts. Act I introduces the 'magic' of Polaroid through the perspective of Polaroid artists and former employees of the corporation. Act II begins with the discontinuation of instant film and covers the grass-roots movement to keep it alive. Act III centers on 'The Impossible Project' and follows their against-the-odds effort to reinvent instant film.
