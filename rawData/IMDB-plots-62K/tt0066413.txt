A man returns to the place where his father was murdered and tries to find closure. But he finds himself in a similar predicament as his late father instead.
Athos Magnani, a young researcher, returns to Tara, where his father was killed before his birth, at the request of Draifa. The father, also named Athos Magnani and looking exactly like the son, was killed by a fascist in 1936 -- or so says Draifa (his mistress), the town statue, and everyone in town. As the son untangles the web of lies this story is constructed from, he finds himself ensnared in the same web.
The son of a wartime anti-fascist hero returns to the scene of his father's assassination and unmasks a plot to cover up the truth behind what really happened. From the short story by Borges 'Theme of the Traitor and the hero'
