A woman's dark and absurdist nightmare vision comprising a continuous recitation of the alphabet and bizarre living representations of each letter.
Against a backdrop of bizarre shapes and textures, a small organic figure gives birth to the letters of the alphabet while a mixture of children's voices and an operatic tune are singing out. The figure's head collapses causing blood to rain on a girl while she lays in her bed, resulting in the girl violently vomiting blood herself.
Mixing uneasy stop-motion animation and corrosive live action with a subconsciously tormenting "Alphabet Song" sung by Robert Chadwick, David Lynch's surreal nightmare on celluloid portrays the endlessly relentless and repulsive transformation of the alphabet. Visceral visions, disturbing fears, and abstract phobias embody a sleeping girl's haunting night-time dream sequences, as the twenty-six letters of the English language become symbols of decay and the punitive tools of a parasitic force. Each letter gives birth to another set of deleterious mutations, up until a climactic ending drenched in bright-red blood. Is there an escape from the ABCs of dread?
