Pedro Ruiz, is a Dominican real estate broker by day and a savvy but out-of-luck thief by night. Desperate to look for respect climbing the money ladder the easy way, and avoiding years of boredom as an employee, he gets in the wrong mansion at the wrong time. Caught in the middle of a twisted plot of power shift, two heavily armed gangs clashed full force, sweeping Pedro and Paz -the daughter of a feared drug trafficker assassinated while Pedro were robbing the mansion-, into the red waters of a bloodbath. A final turn of events put the worlds of everybody involved, upside down.
