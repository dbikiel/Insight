In one of his numerous reconstructed newsreels, the indefatigable French director, Georges Méliès, reenacts a fictional scene taking place in a fort at Tyrnavos during the Greco-Turkish War of 1897.
Three military men, seen inside a fortification, are firing on an unseen enemy force. The call for reinforcements but ladders appear signaling the enemy is about to overrun this position. As they do all the military men run inside the nearby building and close a large door. Four enemy soldiers and an officer breach the fortification and try to break in the door. Failing this the officer call for the use of explosives. All the enemy soldiers take cover as the door is blown down. The officer is the first to return ordering his men to enter the building. As they follow his order he urges even more men to enter but a shot from within rings out killing the officer.
In one of his numerous reconstructed newsreels, the indefatigable French director, Georges Méliès--same as Combat naval en Grèce (1897)--he reenacts a fictional scene taking place in a fort at Tyrnavos during the Greco-Turkish War of 1897. From the interior yard of a well-fortified citadel, four soldiers hold their ground against the Sultan's fez-wearing invaders; however, very soon, all that stands between the two armies will be nothing more than a heavy locked door, as the Turkish hordes break in through the gate.
