TAPIA takes us inside the tortured soul of Johnny Tapia, the 5-time world champion boxer whose unprecedented success was overshadowed by a volatile drug addiction brought on by the brutal rape and murder of his mother at the tender age of 8 years old. Director Eddie Alcazar candidly reveals Tapia's public struggles through intimate interviews, archival footage, and photos that showcase his vivacious personality and child-like gusto. With the love and support of his wife by his side, the film follows Johnny Tapia's rise to one of the most legendary fighters of our time, in and out of the ring.
