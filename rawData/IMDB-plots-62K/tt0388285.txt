In order to prevent a recent high school graduate from getting engaged, two friends intervene by taking him on a cross-country road trip.
He may have just graduated but Nick has it all figured out - marriage, a lucrative career and a totally different lifestyle from that of his West Coast hippy parents. When he discovers that his future wife may be falling prey to a powerful and oversexed music producer, Nick is determined to fly to Toronto to win her back. Lifelong buds and dedicated surfers Tyler and Dime have other ideas for their staid best friend - the road trip adventure of his life. With only three days to make it to the MuchMusic Video Awards, the unlikely road warriors head off. Two sexy hitchhikers, Sasha and Jill, complicate matters and a series of accidents, orchestrated by a malevolent stranger, sabotage the trip turning Nick's future plans upside down.
