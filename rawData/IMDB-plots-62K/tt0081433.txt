A young Texas good ol' boy has a knack with electronic equipment, and that talent gets him a job as a roadie with a raucous travelling rock-and-roll show.
Down home Texas boy Travis W. Redfish falls hard for Lola Bouilliabase, a glitter-spangled groupie determined to lose her virginity to Alice Cooper. Hoping to woo her, Travis signs with a travelling rock band and soon finds himself celebrated as the greatest roadie of all time. Between concerts, Travis uses his wits to make sure that the show goes on, no matter where, no matter what. This does not take long for Travis to realize that, compared to the great rock circus, there's no place like home. However, Lola's date with destiny (and Cooper) to become the greatest groupie of all time looms. Can true love survive rock 'n' roll?
