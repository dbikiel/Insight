Snyder, a historian who has spent many years trying to unlock the powers of a statue, wishes to capture Max for validation of his life's work.
Max is an average underdog boy trying to fit in at school but generally being a bit rubbish. During a field trip a statue turns him into a monster. A historian named Synder captures him and his sister but they break out in time to spoil their older brother, Rod's date. The monster scares his date's poodle before the dog show. Skipping on cash they take the dog to a cheap dog salon and the owner steals it and enters it himself. Rod swoops in and stops them from taking the prize and the men are sent to jail. For no logical reason the boy is restored and after begging to the statue the film ends on Synder gaining the power of the monster.
While on a field trip to a museum, a boy named Max who had not ate any breakfast stood in front of one of three statues that a Doctor Snyder had brought back from the middle east. When The sunlight got exsposed directly over the statue and Max's stomach growled, the statues eyes started glowing and turned Max into a Monster that looked just like the statue that zapped him. When his sister came to find him and saw him change she took him to Doctor Snyder but the doctor tried to hold them captive until Max used the monster strength to open the door. After he had changed back to normal and they got home they had to exsplain things to thier older brother whose girlfriend was upset over her prize poodle being scared by Max. So then after Max changed back to normal again they had to try to figure out how to control his changing and they also stumbled across some men wanting to steal that poodle themselves. Doctor Snyder was trying to trace Max down to find out how things worked with the statues but after Max stopped the thieves at the dog show Snyder went back to the museum and he was hungry and he gets changed into a monster by another statue.
