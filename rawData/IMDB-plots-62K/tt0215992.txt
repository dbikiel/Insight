A magician conjures up a mermaid while fishing.
In his crisp and impeccable suit, a conjurer of dreams and illusions enters the stage wearing his narrow-brimmed top hat. As he fills his hat with water from an empty aquarium nearby, the magician summons up fish of all sizes to inhabit the tank, and much to our amazement, he works his way up, to finally conjure a gracefully mysterious young mermaid. Is she real or is this one of the illusionist's tricks?
A man in a silk top hat stands in front of an empty aquarium. He pours water into his hat and goes fishing, hooking a small one. He becomes a hobo and catches more and more fish from the hat. Then he starts pulling out rabbits. The backdrop becomes the sea, and a mermaid appears. She flirts and beguiles us. The mermaid becomes a woman who leaves the sea and joins the magician, who becomes Neptune.
