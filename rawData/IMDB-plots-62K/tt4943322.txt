This movie is a love story between an idealistic American nurse and a Turkish officer in World War I.
A strong-willed young woman, who, frustrated by on-going injustice at home, leaves the U.S. after meeting Jude, an American doctor who runs a remote medical mission within the Ottoman Empire. A world both exotic and dangerous, and on the brink of what is about to become World War I. There, she finds her loyalty to Jude and the mission's founder tested when she falls in love with their perceived enemy, a Lieutenant in the Ottoman Imperial Army. Now, with invading army forces at their doorstep, and the world about to plunge into all-out war, she must make a decision if she wants to be what other people want her to be, or to be herself.
In 1914, in Philadelphia, the wealthy and idealistic nurse Lillie Rowe learns in a lecture by Dr. Jude that there is an American medical mission founded by Dr. Garrett Woodruff in the countryside of the Ottoman Empire that needs donation. She decides to donate and deliver herself the truck that belonged to her deceased brother and medical supplies using her heritage. Upon arrival, she stumbles upon the Ottoman Lieutenant Ismail Veli that helps her to visit a mosque. Lillie is forced by the government to be escorted by Lieutenant Ismail to drive to the mission, and he is assigned to spy on the local Armenians. Lillie works in the hospital and falls in love with Ismail while Jude suffers from unrequited love. Meanwhile, World War I begins, and the mission is in the middle of the Ottoman Empire where the Russians are coming.
