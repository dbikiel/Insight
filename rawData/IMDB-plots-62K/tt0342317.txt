Town Hall, New York City, 26 June 2000. An evening with Eddie Izzard in which he moves back and forth in time, with religion as the loose but constant theme. He begins with Pope John Paul II, and then criss-crosses to Pius XII, the Spanish Inquisition, the Crusades and Jerusalem, the world's five major religions, the Dark Ages, Jesus, and the future. Along the way, Izzard makes observations about guns and monkeys, the World Series, the NRA and the IRA, mad cows, Socrates, the Stoned Olympics, the Roman Empire, the Renaissance, and the Mona Lisa. Izzard wears black nylons, black leather pants, a black jacket and a diamond necklace.
