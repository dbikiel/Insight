When Haddock refuses to sell, he's nearly killed. After a while, the truth comes out: Paparanic and his crew led a coup in Tetaragua, a small Latin-American country. After ruling the country for three years, Paparanic left with the gold of the National Bank, and now his old shipmates are to trying get hold of it.
