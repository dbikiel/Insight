Little Pablito is the ten year old son of a cruel horse trainer. The trainer is responsible for training a Mexican General's horse to jump for the grand race. The trainer's methods cause the horse to become afraid of jumping and the general orders the animal's death. Pablito runs away with the horse, becoming a fugitive. He travels throughout Mexico encountering several fugitives and a priest who tries to help.
