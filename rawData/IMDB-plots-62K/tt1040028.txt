Living on the outer boundaries of society, the eponymous orange thief and some other country-wise ruffians steal fruit for sustenance, sale, and the sheer excitement of courting danger. After the thief ends up in a Sicilian jail, his life takes an unexpected turn when his bunkmate promises him a deal.
In Sicily, a young man loves the land but has none. He sleeps under the stars, steals and sells oranges, and longs for a piece of the earth he can call his. Thievery gets him tossed in jail where his cell mate is Turrido, the "Smooth Blade," serving a life sentence for murder. Turrido offers the thief a deal: get Turrido's ex-lover Rosalba to make a recording of her singing and Turrido will give the thief a piece of land. His sentence completed, the orange thief must find the exotic Rosalba and then overcome her opposition to making the recording. Can he succeed? He's assisted in odd ways by a French tourist and a traveling salesman.
