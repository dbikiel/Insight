In post-Soviet Russia, troubled underage boys caught at various offenses (from stealing to multiple murder) are committed for a few years to closed state reform schools. There, they live in a military type of regime, starting the day with open air exercises, making beds to absurdly meticulous rules etcetera. Ironically, many come from such poor and/or abusive, often broken families that a structured life with three square meals, a warm dorm and regular classes feels like a better deal, some actually dread returning home.
