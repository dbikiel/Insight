France, 1719. Four years after Louix XIV's death, Philippe d'Orleans is the regent for the nine-year-old Louis XIV. Philippe is a liberal and a libertine. His right-hand man, Dubois, an atheistic and cupid priest, as libertine as Philippe, tries to take advantage of a little rebellion lead by a Breton squire named Pontallec and of the famine to become archbishop.
