Tarzan and Jane go to New York to rescue Boy after he is kidnapped into a circus.
Circus owner Buck Rand kidnaps Boy to perform in his show. He forces a pilot to fly him, Boy and his animal trainer out of the jungle. Tarzan and Jane follow them to New York. At a trial over custody of Boy, Tarzan becomes violent and is jailed. With the help of the pilot's girlfriend Tarzan (who has since escaped, diving off the Brooklyn Bridge) finds the circus. He and the circus elephants complete the classic rescue.
When an airplane lands on the escarpment, Tarzan tells Boy to stay away from it and the men who've arrived on it. Boy is fascinated by the airplane however and can't keep himself away. Buck Rand and the men are there to capture animals for circus acts and they see the perfect circus act in Boy and his pet baby elephants. When a fire breaks out forcing them to quickly flee the jungle, Rand takes Boy with him. Jane and Tarzan must fly to New York City but even when they find him, they are forced to go to court to maintain custody.
Instead of returning to the United States loaded with rare specimens of African animals for a Brooklyn circus, the great hunter, Buck Rand; the renowned animal trainer, Manchester Montford, and their reluctant pilot, Jimmie Shields, kidnap Boy in the middle of a blazing fire. Now, to save the helpless boy from the clutches of a rapacious entrepreneur, Tarzan and Jane must leave the escarpment to comb New York's inhospitable urban jungle; however, this time, it seems that the King is just out of his depth. Can Tarzan track down Boy in this hazardous concrete maze?
