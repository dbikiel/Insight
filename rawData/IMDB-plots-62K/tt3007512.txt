The Greeks arrive and start to shell the village. Hasan bids them farewell. Art rushes to a hilltop to show Joshua an escape path but refuses to follow him. Joshua talks to him and Art relents, so that the two escape together. Back at Istanbul Joshua finds Ayshe who isn't surprised that he has returned.
