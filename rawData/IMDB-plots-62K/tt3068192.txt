As Grace heads off to college and experiences a lifestyle far different than the one she had brought up under her grandmother's strict hand, she begins a traumatic downward spiral that threatens her sanity. The more she explores the true nature of her nightmares and black outs, the more it becomes clear that an outside, supernatural force is responsible.
The eighteen year-old Grace is a Catholic teenager raised by her grandmother Helen since her mother died giving birth to her and her father is unknown. Grace joins the university and has frequent blackouts. The doctor diagnoses her and tells that she might have a mental condition, suggesting her to visit a psychiatrist. However the pious Helen brings her granddaughter home and forces her to frequent the church. Soon Grace discovers hidden secrets from her mother and the priests tells that evil is inside her.
