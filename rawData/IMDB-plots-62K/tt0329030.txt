The Dust Factory is an adventure about the love and friendship between two teenagers who help each other through a difficult time in their lives.
After his dad Ryan senior's death in a truck accident, schoolboy Ryan Flynn, a gentle, somewhat nerdy space-fan, becomes a recluse. He shuts up completely after a fall and near-drowning experience while roaming the countryside with his admirably patient, cheerful playmate Rocky Mazzelli. Only Ryan's late granddad finds a magical way to get trough to him and introduce him to a mysterious place, the 'dust factory'. There grandpa and resident teenager Melanie 'Pan' Lewis shows how youngsters prepare for their next life phase. But deciding when they are isn't easy or safe.
Haunting family fantasy film about a young boy who is drowning and falls into a parallel limbo world in which the dying hover between life and death. A very lyrical story where the young boy will meet where love and magic and courage will be part of his journey.
