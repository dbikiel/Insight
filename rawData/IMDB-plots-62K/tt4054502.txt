Mia and Mirjam are 14 years old and live in a dead boring town, there's not even an airport. They are not grown up, but are working on it. Mirjam jumps the gun on adult life and starts an affair with an older man - he says he loves her, but the facade is breaking. Mia has a dad who drinks a little bit too much. Luckily they have each other, and Karl, their super smart friend who knows almost everything.
