A centenarian artist and scientist in 1890 Paris maintains his youth and health by periodically replacing a gland with that of a living person.
In 1890, in Paris, the artist Dr. Georges Bonnet invites a group of friends for a private exposition of his new sculpture. Among the guests are Dr. Pierre Gerrard and his companion Janine Du Bois that had an affair with Dr. Bonnet ten years ago in Italy. When they see each other, their love rekindle. However Dr. Bonnet has a dark secret since he is 104 years old and needs to have a gland transplanted every ten years to keep his youth. But his partner and friend Dr. Ludwig Weiss had a stroke in Switzerland and cannot perform the surgery.
A remake of "The Man in Half Moon Street" (1945) (qv.). Dr. Bonner plans to live forever through periodic gland transplants from younger, healthier human victims. Bonner looks about 40; he's really 104 years old. But people are starting to get suspicious, and he may not make 200.
