"Doctor in Clover", a.k.a. "Carnaby, M.D." is another "Doctor" movie, but this time, Dr. Gaston Grimsdyke (Leslie Phillips) is the main doctor in the story, looking for love and romance from the hospital nurses, much to the annoyance of main Administrator Sir Lancelot Spratt (James Robertson Justice), who wants his doctors to be one hundred percent focussed on the job. Numerous antics follow, with Dr. Grimsdyke getting Spratt fixed up with the new prim-and-proper Matron Sweet (Joan Sims), and his attempted failures to lure the hospital's beauty, the physiotherapist.
