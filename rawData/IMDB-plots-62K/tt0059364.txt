The first "Kommissar X" movie. Tony and Brad investigate the murders of politicians and scientists. They soon face off against a team of super hit women with their usual flair. Look for all the action and style that let to numerous follow-up films. The series theme song, "I Love You Joe Walker" never sounded so good.
Based on a popular series of German adventure novels, the Kommissar X films sprang up in Germany as competition to the popular exploits of James Bond. Private eye Joe Walker (so cool and egotistical that he has his own personal theme song!) and police captain Tom Rowland must find out who's killing off a group of influential businessmen. The reason? A fortune in gold made radioactive so it couldn't be claimed for five years... but now someone can't wait!
