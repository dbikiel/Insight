British flying aces in World War I contend with the harsh realities of war.
In 1915 France, Major Brand commands the 39th Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps. The young airmen go up in bullet-riddled "crates" and the casualty rate is appalling, but Brand can't make the "brass hats" at headquarters see reason. Insubordinate air ace Captain Courtney is another thorn in Brand's side...but finds the smile wiped from his face when he rises to command the squadron himself. Everyone keeps a stiff upper lip.
During World War I, pilots fight and die in what seems to be an endless war. Veterans Courtney and Scott have survived many near misses and shake their head in despair at the arrival of new replacement pilots, some with only a few hours of flying experience. Most don't survive their first sortie and Courtney for one chides their commanding officer, Major Brand, for sending them to their death. When Brand is promoted however, it's Courtney who is put in charge of the squadron and he soon finds himself making the same difficult decisions Brand faced. When Scott's younger brother arrives fresh-faced from flight school, Courtney orders the lad out on patrol over Scott's objections. The young man's death drives a wedge between them. When Scott volunteers for what will inevitably be a suicide mission, Courtney decides to take on the mission himself.
