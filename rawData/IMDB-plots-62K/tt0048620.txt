A European family in East Africa finds itself caught up in an uprising by local black Africans against their white colonial masters. Based on the Mau-Mau rebellion in Kenya in the early 1950s.
When Alan Howard, a young Englishman, arrives in Kenya to visit his older brother on his farm he finds the latter has been brutally murdered by the Mau Mau. He decides to go on exploiting the farm and to fight the rebels with all his energy. He falls in love with Mary, the daughter of a settler who lives close to his estate. Although the young woman shares his love she disapproves of Alan's hatred of Blacks. Alan will eventually mellow after Dr. Karanja, a native physician, sacrifices his life to prevent the slaughter of a group of white settlers.
Alan Howard (Sir Dirk Bogarde) arrives in Kenya to work on a ranch owned by his brother, and is met at the airport by an old friend, Mary Crawford (Virginia McKenna). He finds his brother has been murdered by the Mau Mau, a native organization determined to drive out the whites. Howard decides to stay, influenced by his love for Mary, as well as other considerations. She refuses to believe that all of the natives are bad, while Mr. Crawford (Basil Sydney) is suspicious of all, especially Dr. Karanja (Earl Cameron), for whom Mary once worked as a nurse. Mr. Crawford suspects he is Simba, leader of the local Mau Mau. When Mary's parents are slain by the sect, Dr. Karanja reveals to the Police that he believes Simba to be his own father. Alan is marked for death, with his farm deserted, the telephone wires cut, and his car burned. Mary and Dr. Karanja show up, with Karanja attempting to talk the attackers out of their deeds until his father forces them on. Alan kills Simba, and the attackers fatally wound Dr. Karanja before the Police close in.
