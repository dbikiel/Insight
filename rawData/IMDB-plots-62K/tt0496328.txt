High School grad and all American gal, Anna, finds her purpose and herself after she hooks up with the radical feminists in The Itty Bitty Titty Committee.
Anna is a young lesbian high school graduate who still lives with her parents, and works as a receptionist in a plastic surgeon's office.

With an undeniable attraction to this sexy, raw rebel gurl, Anna eagerly joins the ranks of C(i)A and starts her rollercoaster ride from meek and mousy to bad-ass bravado. Full of mosh pits, power fists and utter charm,
