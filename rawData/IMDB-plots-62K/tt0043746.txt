Bomba the Jungle Boy informs ne'er-do-well lion hunters that the lions were meant to roam the jungle freely. Since they pay him no attention, Bomba must save the lions (and Jean, incidentally).
Bomba the Jungle Boy finds a wounded lion dying a slow and painful death, he finds a group on safari trapping lions for sale to zoos, which were unable to obtain such animals during the war. Tom Forbes, accompanied by his daughter Jean, is traveling downstream to join his business partner Marty Martin, who has already captured several beasts for shipment. As Bomba sets out to release the animals as soon as they are captured, he gains an ally in Jean Forbes whom he convinces the capturing and display of animals is wrong. Martin is bent on succeeding however, even if it means killing the Jungle Boy.
