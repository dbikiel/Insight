An Army medic brings his girlfriend to stay with him at an out of the way Vietnam outpost in 1967, the woman disappears one day and he begins searching for her.
Life in NCO Eddie Diamond's US Army Vietnam jungle hell-hole medic post is so quite, ignored by daily-passing VC, that Mark Fossie feels it safe enough to smuggle in his US girlfriend Marianne Bell, against buddy Rat Kiley's advice. She first takes a naively-positive interest in Vietnamese wildlife, natives and culture but amusingly distracts the men and tries amateur comfort-nursing. Once she gets to know army life, that includes the 'greenies', combat troops, whose dangerous patrols she wants to taste, with dire consequences.
