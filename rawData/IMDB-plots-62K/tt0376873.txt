The story of two couples who are neighbors and the marital problems caused by the unexpected arrival of two important personages of their past. The first couple, Carlos and Ana, live on the seventh floor of a building. Ana feels she's entitled to more love than her husband is willing to give. Suddenly, an old friend, Tomás, reappears after many years away and stays at their house. Andréa and Miguel live in the building across the street and are also going through a marriage crisis. In a party, they meet Cláudia, Miguel's first girlfriend, and she has no place to stay. Naturally, she's invited to sleep at their place. The presence of the two newcomers will cause many changes in their relationships.
In Rio de Janeiro, the photographer Ana and the writer Carlos are a young couple in crisis. Anna requests more attention and love, but Carlos is trying to concentrate himself in the writing of a book. They live in the fancy zone of Lagoa, one of the most expensive places in Rio de Janeiro, in an apartment that belongs to Carlos' mother, Yara. In the other side of the same street, the former model Andréa and her mate, the publisher Miguel are also in crisis, for similar reasons, since Andréa needs more attention from Miguel. Ana and Carlos receive a surprise visitor, Tomás, who was the former love of Ana, and Andréa and Miguel lodges the zoologist Cláudia, the former and first love of Miguel, who was living in the USA.
