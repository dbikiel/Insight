This film depicts the life of Saint John Bosco (1815 - 1888). He dedicated his life to rescuing abandoned and exploited street children in Turin. He was the founder of the Salesian order, which today runs schools and vocational centres about the world. Don Bosco strives against official obstruction in Church and State to establish his refuges. Escaping an assassination attempt, he goes to Rome, where the Pope endorses his work. He dies with his work complete.
This is the story of Don (Father) Bosco, also known in the Catholic church as St. John Bosco. This 19th century Italian priest worked in the city of Torino (Turin). He founded the Salesian order dedicated to teaching and youth work. That work continues worldwide today.
