Britannia Hospital is not preparing for a visit from Queen Elizabeth1, who died in 1603. The visitor is a fictional representation of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother.
Mick Travis (Malcolm McDowell) is a reporter who is about to shoot a documentary on Britannia Hospital, an institution which mirrors the downsides of British Society. It's the day when Her Royal Highness Queen Elizabeth I is to visit the hospital to inaugurate a new wing, where advanced (and sinister) scientific experiments led by Professor Millar (Graham Crowden) will take place. Everybody in the hospital, from the cooks who refuse to cook, to the painters who couldn't care less to get their job done, to an African cannibalistic dictator (Ã  la Idi Amin Dada Oumee) who demonstrators want expelled from the hospital and tried, will contribute to making Her Royal Highness Queen Elizabeth I's visit (and Mick Travis' life) a true nightmare.
