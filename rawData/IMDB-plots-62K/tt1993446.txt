In the last five years 62,000 Russian children have been abducted, taken out of the country and sold. This gripping, hard-hitting drama is the remarkable story of one of these children. (Russian with English subtitles).
Yarik is a touching movie about a 5 or 6 year old boy who is apparently abandoned in a train station by his mother while waiting to be picked up by his father. Yarik meets a series of people who attempt to help him without getting too involved. However, despite the help of some individuals, Yarik ends up in the hands of some evil individuals who sell abandoned children organ and body donors. One individual who remembers being an orphan and abandoned attempts to save Yarik, despite his own life being in a shambles. The movie appears to be a reaction to a serious problem that many Russians would rather not confront. Please note, I watched the movie with English subtitles and there appeared to be more dialog than was transcribed so those who watched in Russian may have a better perspective on the movie.
