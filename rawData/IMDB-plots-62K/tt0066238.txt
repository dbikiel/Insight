Co-directed by Godard with the Dziga Vertov group in 1969, 'Pravda' is a direct attack to revisionism and socialist imperialism. With his usual heterogeneous collage of images taken from real life, the film is structured in a sort of letter that a man writes to a woman called Rosa from Bulgaria and later from Czechoslovakia.
