A happy and hilarious couple (also known as "The Beau Brummels") perform "While Strolling Through the Park" and "Don't Forget to Breathe or Else You'll Die."
Vaudevillians Al Shaw and Sam Lee take to the stage in identical ill-fitting suits with bowlers and bow ties. Standing shoulder to shoulder facing the camera, they begin and end with comic songs; between the songs is a string of jokes and quips. The first song is a parody of "In the merry, merry month of May" and the concluding song is a song about a song. At the end, they throw in a bit of tap dancing. The camera doesn't move.
