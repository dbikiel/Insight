A very good film shot by Y. Moroz with 3 pretty girls Dasha Moroz, Anna Ukolova and Vika Isakova. The film is about life of several tarts who live on outskirts of ukrainian provincial town Makeevka. We see all grisly reality of this country, the cruel rules of survival on streets of Makeevka (home city of one of the girls) and Moskow ghettos, it's inhuman customs and cops plunged in crime up to their ears.. This movie is one of the best modern russian action movies, and one of few. And this movie is also a good one for getting a short course of new modern russia's life that is for majority of people not so different since the time of changes
