Two bumbling press agents must search for a zombie to fulfill a commitment to their ex-gangster boss's new nightclub or face the consequences.
Two inept press agents are ordered to the island of San Sebastian to get a zombie for an opening night publicity stunt of a nightclub. They find a likely source in Dr. Paul Renault, who has spent much time studying (and experimenting) on the subject, but Renault has other ideas.
Jerry Miles (Wally Brown) and Mike Strager (Alan Carney), press agents for a new night club in New York City, owned by Ace Miller (Sheldon Leonard,), plan to star a zombie as part of the opening night publicity. Ace, fearing exposure, if the zombie isn't "real", by Douglas Walker (Louis Jean Heydt), a militant radio commentator in the mode of Walter Winchell, threatens the two agents with a sudden demise. THey hasten to the Virgin Islands, where Professor Paul Renault (Bela Lugosi), the maddest of mad doctors, has set up a zombie-producing company. They meet Jean La Danse (Anne Jeffreys), a caf√© entertainer, who aids them in their quest.
