After being banished from their tribe, two hunter-gatherers encounter Biblical characters and eventually wind up in the city of Sodom.
Zed, a prehistoric would-be hunter, eats from a tree of forbidden fruit and is banished from his tribe, accompanied by Oh, a shy gatherer. On their travels, they meet Cain and Abel on a fateful day, stop Abraham from killing Isaac, become slaves, and reach the city of Sodom where their tribe is now enslaved. Zed and Oh are determined to rescue the women they love, Maya and Eema. Standing in their way is Sodom's high priest and the omnipresent Cain. Zed tries to form an alliance with Princess Innana, which may backfire. Can an inept hunter and a smart but slender and diffident gatherer become heroes and make a difference?
Zed and Oh are two tribesman. Zed is a hunter and Oh is a gatherer. After being informed Zed ate from Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, he is banished from the tribe. Oh decides to go with Zed on his journey to find the end of the Earth. Along the way, they encounter Cain and Abel (David Cross and Paul Rudd), and Abraham (Hank Azaria). After, Zed and Oh notice the girls they wanted to "lay with" (Maya and Eema) from their former tribe have been enslaved, they head off on a journey to save them.(Source: WikiPedia. Bangs_McCoy)
