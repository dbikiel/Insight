A man and a woman crossing the India-Bangladesh border reflect on their love and on the events leading to the 1947 Partition of Bengal.
Filmmaker Anup Singh constructs a documentary-like feature that serves both as a tribute to the life and work of Indian filmmaker Ritwik Ghatak, particularly his Partition Trilogy (1960-1962), and as a reflection on the Partition of Bengal in 1947, which caused millions of Hindus to migrate from East Bengal to India. The story partially focuses on a man and a woman crossing the India-Bangladesh border while they reflect on their love and on the events leading to the newly established borders. Through imagery, landscapes, memories and metaphors, the film explores the inexplicability of a past that once was but still has an influence on the present.
