A dropout comes to the aid of a chubby and suicidal high-school kid by recruiting him as the drummer for his upstart punk-rock band.
An overweight teen with no friends puts his planned suicide on hold after he is taken under the wing of an older yet unstable punk rocker in this tender adaptation of award-winning young adult novel. Troy Billings is a misfit with a weight problem. He's hatched a plan to end it all when out of the blue he meets 18-year-old non-conformist Marcus Macrae, whose devil-may-care attitude gives Troy an optimistic new outlook on life. Troy's merciful reprieve from depression meets an unexpected challenge, however, when his strict father deems Marcus a druggie troublemaker, and forbids the two from being friends. Fat Kid Rules the World marks the feature directorial debut of longtime actor.
