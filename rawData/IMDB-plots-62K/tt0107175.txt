Romance about Simon Donnadieu and his decision to leave his ever-loving wife Rachel.
This is Godard's version of the Greek myth of Amphitryon : Zeus (God here) takes Amphitryon's (Simon's) features to seduce his wife Alcmena (Rachel) while he is at war. God's purpose is to feel what is a real love between husband and wife, while his servant Max Mercure reckons it is only a sex affair.But Rachel doesn't recognize completely her husband and refuses him a kiss. Although God recalls her the scene of Simon's departure, she is not convinced and suspects the truth. Eventually, it seems that she makes love with God knowingly. When he goes away, he offers her immortality, but she refuses, preferring her life with her husband.When Simon returns, he understands what happened, and forgives his wife, saying that "one must know how to accept love". They are seen going away hand in hand.The whole story is accompanied (and interrupted) by the commentaries of a bookseller, Abraham Klimt, and a preacher.
