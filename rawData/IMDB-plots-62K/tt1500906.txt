Belgium's vampire community invites a documentary crew to film one of their families: husband, wife, and two teen children - Georges, Bertha, Sampson, and Grace. The teens have problems: Sampson wants to sleep with the community leader's wife (the only sexual taboo) and Grace wears pink and wants to be human. The family eats (they keep a young woman for snacks, and the police drop off immigrants for them), visits their community school, chats with a coffin maker, goes to parties, and looks down their nose at a childless vampire couple who live in their basement. We learn of the vampire code, forced exile in Canada, and the fate of the Sampson and Grace.
