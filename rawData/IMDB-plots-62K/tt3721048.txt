Former bank clerk Takeharu thought he was strange when he moved to a remote village in Japan's northeastern Tohoku region after developing an inexplicable "money allergy." However as he attempts to live a peaceful rural life without currency, Kamuroba village's bizarre characters draw him out of his shell in this increasingly surreal madcap comedy. Then a nearby town leader attempts to overthrow the handyman bus driver mayor, Takeharu must prove his attachment to Kamuroba and its people.
