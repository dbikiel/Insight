A young girl who's terrified her insane (birth) mother will take her away from her beloved foster mother. One day, when the birth mother attempts to contact the girl at school, but her foster mother has a premonition and gets there, just in time to protect the girl. Eventually, the real mother and her boy friend (a carnival clown), do exactly what the girl feared; they takes her away, leaving the bereaved foster parents to enlist the aid of a parapsychologist to help them understand terrifying dreams they've had, and find the girl before it's too late.
Five-year-old Janie Bennett happily lives with her foster parents Miles and Sheri Bennett, oblivious to the fact that her insane birth mother is attempting to kidnap her. When the birth mother, Andrea Fletcher, and her boyfriend Jude, a carny, do attempt to kidnap the girl, Andrea can't go through with it. The girl later wanders away after she and Sheri are in a car accident and she winds up being found at the carnival by Jude. Her worried foster parents then enlist the assistance of a parapsychologist to help them interpret the foster mother's terrifying dreams and psychic connection to the girl and find her before it is too late.
