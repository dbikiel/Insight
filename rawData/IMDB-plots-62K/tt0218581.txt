A young Italian actress embarks on a self-destructive spree of sex, drugs and other excess while doing some soul searching to find the path for redemption.
Anna Battista is a young, popular, 24-year-old Italian-born International film actress who engages herself on a hectic and self-destructive spree which takes her across Europe and to America to shed her "boy-toy" image to become an "artist" in order to write and direct herself in a semi-biography movie of herself titled "Scarlet Diva." After working in Rome, and winning a presigious film award in Milan, Anna travels to Paris to save her best friend from an abusive relationship, then avoids sleazy film producers in Los Angeles, meets and falls in love with a rock star who abandons her, finds out later that she's pregnant, and begins using drugs to numb her pain at this predictament she's gotten herself into.
In her audacious feature directorial debut, Asia Argento stars as Anna Battista, a young Italian actress whose self-destructive tendencies are not helped by the highly exploitative industry that she is a part of. Indulging sleazy men while trying to take ownership of her creative aspirations, Anna struggles to make her way, though the odds are stacked against her. Based on Asia's own experiences, SCARLET DIVA is raw, deeply personal and stylistically inventive.
