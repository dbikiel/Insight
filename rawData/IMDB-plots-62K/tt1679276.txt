The child-duo Rico and Oskar, one of them is quite more sluggish, but precisely because of fantasy and own world view; the other one is a smart whiz, but scared for life.
RICO (10) is an unusual boy. Sometimes he's being laughed at because he mixes things up in his head and doesn't know his left from his right. But Rico is brilliant at noticing the little things. Like a piece of pasta lying on the pavement. Or the strange on-goings in the apartment block where he lives. But it isn't until his new friends, the gifted but anxious OSKAR (8), is kidnapped that Rico gets the chance to put all his special skills - and tenacity - to the test.
Pre-teen simpleton (Fede)Rico lives i a Berlin apartment with his mother, a single escort 'employee', obsessively clinging to post-its and procedures to compensate for his utter inability to think properly, leading to very unequal relationships with various neighbors. When he bumps into bright, younger but paranoid (autistic?) Oscar, the boys strike an instant friendship. Insisting to stay home alone while his mother travels to keep an appointment with Oscar, Rico is stood-up and believes him to have become the latest victim of the city's serial kids abductor. Far-fetched 'clues' lead him to suspect anyone in turn, even super-nice new neighbor Simon Westb√ºhl, and investigate clumsily all over the neighborhood. By coincidence, he really finds Oscar in need of rescue.
