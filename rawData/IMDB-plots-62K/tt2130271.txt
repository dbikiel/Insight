Grandpa Sam Dracula is essentially Dracula who assembled Herman because no man was good enough for his daughter Lily, a sexy vampiress. Lily's niece Marilyn the freak is actually normal and Lily and Herman's only child, Eddie, has his werewolf tendencies surface in puberty, forcing the family to relocate to their famous 1313 Mockingbird Lane address.
A reboot of The Munsters, it was written and executive produced by Fuller as a one-hour drama with "spectacular visuals." The special concerns the day-to-day life of a family of benign monsters, with married couple Herman Munster (a Frankenstein's monster/zombie) and Lily Munster (a vampire). Lily's father, Grandpa is also a vampire who lives with the family and is feral. Herman and Lily have a son, Eddie, who learns in the course of the special that he is a werewolf, and their niece, Marilyn, also lives with them. It explored the origins of the Munster family and was darker and edgier, while retaining plenty of humor.
