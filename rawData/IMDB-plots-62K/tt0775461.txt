The elements that rule Earth - Air, Fire, Earth and Water - are on their "regular inspection tour." We are following Water, in the form of the Rain Fairy (Lenka Vlasáková). Traversing the land dressed like a poor woman, she learns that people really have begun focusing mainly on money and that love and goodness are disappearing. The Rain Fairy is a classic romantic fairy tale, but one that deviates from contemporary story clichés.
