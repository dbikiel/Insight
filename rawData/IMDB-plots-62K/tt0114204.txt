In 1945, military doctor Andrzej Kwiatkowski pretends to be a communist army colonel in order to save innocent people from Stalinist imprisonment and to get the heart of the girl he's in love with.
In turbulent 1945, the talented and non-Communist military doctor, Andrzej Kwiatkowski, receives a generous one-week leave of absence by a grateful patient and colonel in the UB: the Polish Intelligence Service. Surrounded by the ruins of a battle-scarred Warsaw, Andrzej falls head-over-heels in love with his beautiful neighbour, Krysia--and after a romantic dinner in the city's surviving hotel, and an argument with an inebriated Russian officer--the cornered surgeon summons up the courage to impersonate the high-ranking government official. Now, with the aid of Krysia and his old friend from the army, Dudek, the compassionate impostor embarks on a dangerous mission to save as many innocent prisoners as possible. However, how long can Colonel Kwiatkowski maintain the charade?
