After being mistakenly certified as an electrical engineer, Buster is hired to wire a house.
Botany major Buster mistakenly graduates in electrical engineering and is hired to wire a new home. He installs lots of fanciful gadgets. The one who should have received the degree gets even by rewiring all the gadgets to wreak havoc.
By a twist of fate, Buster, the fresh Botany graduate, is hired by the college's dean to "electrify" his beautiful mansion, after being mistaken for a professional electrical engineer. To prove his worth--as both the employer and his young daughter leave for a short vacation--Buster equips the entire house with state-of-the-art gadgetry and high-powered electronic contraptions meant to make one's life easier. However, there's one man who is green with envy, bent on getting even. Is there an escape from the electric mayhem?
