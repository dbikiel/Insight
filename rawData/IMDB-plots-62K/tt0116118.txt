The newly-regenerated Doctor takes on the Master on the turn of the millennium, 31 December 1999.
The Doctor, an alien time traveller from the planet Gallifrey, is transporting the remains of his nemesis, the Master back to their homeworld. However the Master is not as dead as the Doctor thinks. The Master's essence escapes and sabotages the TARDIS, the Doctor's time machine causing it to crash land in San Franscisco on December 30th 1999. The Doctor requires a beryllium atomic clock to repair the TARDIS, but is shot as he leaves it. Taken to hospital, the Doctor's seventh regeneration is triggered by a surgeon, confused by his alien physiology, while the Master takes over a paramedic's body. He needs a Time Lord's body to survive and be able to regenerate again so he needs the Doctor's. The newly regenerated the Doctor must fight to save his own eighth body, and the world when the Master sabotages the TARDIS' power source. By midnight on December 31st 1999, the Earth will be pulled through this power-source, a mini-black hole, and only the Doctor can stop if only he can remember who he is...
While transporting the remains of the Master, an evil Time Lord, the Doctor suffers a TARDIS malfunction and ends up in San Francisco in 1999. The Master escapes and assumes a bodily form, the Doctor regenerates, and with the help of an attractive heart surgeon the Doctor must locate and defeat the Master before the turn of the millennium at midnight.
