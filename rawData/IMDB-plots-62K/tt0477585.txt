"Cafe Transit" depicts an independent-minded widow who bucks tradition to run her dead husband's truck stop café.
In the wake of her husband's death, headstrong widow Reyhan (Fereshtei Sadre Orafaei) longs to re-open his successful border cafe, despite rigid social standards that explicitly discourage her from doing so. Isolated from her friends and neighbours for her fervent efforts to resurrect the business, Reyhan also faces pressure from her conservative brother-in-law Nasser (Parviz Parastoei) who longs to take Reyhan as his second wife. Despite Nasser's vengeful efforts to break Reyhan's spirits and put her out of business, Reyhan's culinary skills soon begin drawing in a healthy clientele that includes kindly Greek trucker Zakariyo (Nikolas Padapopoulis), whose relationship with the determined restauranteur may provide an exit from her current crisis.
