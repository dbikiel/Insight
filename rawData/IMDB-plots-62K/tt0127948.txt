A man rents an apartment and furnishes it in remarkable fashion.
In need of a room to spend the night, a weary traveller arrives at a hotel and asks the helpful concierge for a temporary accommodation. Luckily, there is still one room available, however, it is completely unfurnished, let alone, decorated. Normally, this would be a serious problem, not for our extraordinary resident though, whose peculiar handbag contains everything but the kitchen sink. As if by magic, the mysterious lodger will put the finishing touches on his new cosy space, nevertheless, is the landlord's wife happy with the fiendish tenant?
A man carrying a carpetbag comes to see the concierge of an apartment building, and is shown an unfurnished room that is available. He agrees to rent it, and opens up his bag so that he can begin to move in. The bag contains an astonishing variety of furnishings and decorations, and soon he and his family have settled in. All is well until the day comes when the rent is due.
