A practical joking father tries to reconnect with his hard working daughter by creating an outrageous alter ego and posing as her CEO's life coach.
Winfried doesn't see much of his working daughter Ines. He pays her a surprise visit in Bucharest, where she's busy as a corporate strategist. The geographical change doesn't help them to see more eye to eye. Practical joker Winfried annoys his daughter with corny pranks and jabs at her routine lifestyle of meetings and paperwork. Father and daughter reach an impasse, and Winfried agrees to go home to Germany. Enter Toni Erdmann: Winfried's flashy alter ego. Disguised in a tacky suit, weird wig and fake teeth, Toni barges into Ines' work circle, claiming to be her CEO's life coach. As Toni, Winfried doesn't hold back, and Ines meets the challenge. The harder they push, the closer they become. In all the madness, Ines begins to see that her eccentric father deserves a place in her life.
Whiling away the hours in Aachen, the divorced and practical joke-prone piano teacher, Winfried, decides to reconnect with Ines: his estranged only daughter, and now a determined business consultant in Bucharest. Of course, surprise visits rarely are welcome--and as the audacious parent adopts a new persona, the flamboyantly outspoken and deliciously extravagant, Toni Erdmann--he takes everyone by storm, infiltrating Ines' well-organised life and her close professional circle. Without a doubt, after years of alienation, Winfried--as his alter-ego, Toni--attempts to make a difference, in high hopes of bridging the gap between them; however, is his unorthodox attempt at reconciliation too little, too late?

Father and daughter at an impasse and it comes to a confrontation between the two.But instead, as announced to leave Bucharest, he surprised Ines with a radical transformation in Toni Erdmann, his dazzling alter ego.
