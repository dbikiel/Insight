Lucien Paumelle has been a human rights activist for decades and his relatives are not astonished when he announces that he is determined to help illegal immigrants by giving them shelter in his apartment. But they are downright appalled when they meet the undocumented aliens for the fist time, a little girl named Sorina and, mostly her mother, Tatiana, a twenty-eight-year old sex bomb. To make matters worse, Lucien offhandedly tells his next of kin that he has just ... married Tatiana. How will Arnaud, his son, and Babette, his daughter, react?
