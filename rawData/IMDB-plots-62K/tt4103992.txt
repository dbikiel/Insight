The Sheffield family deals with home truths as their middle child inherits the Foxworth mansion with the family's ghosts ever-looming. The curse lives on and more tragedies are in store.
The Dollanganger Saga continues into the early 1990s. After undergoing psychiatric treatment in his teens following his encounter with his now-deceased grandmother Corrine Foxworth, Bart Sheffield has become the sole heir of her estate. He has rebuilt and moved into Foxworth Hall and legally changed his last name to Foxworth. The estate is legally being managed by Bart's father, Christopher Sheffield, until Bart turns 25 as stipulated in Corrine's will. Bart brings together his entire family to celebrate this important birthday, on which an extra clause in Corrine's will is to be read as she had instructed. The family includes: his parents Chris and Cathy Sheffield, whose incestuous relationship disgusts Bart; his older brother and sister-in-law, Jory and Melodie Marquet, who are both renowned ballet dancers; and his adopted younger teenage sister, Cindy Sheffield, who is openly exploring her sexuality. Bart has pushed his family away since his psychiatric treatment, especially Chris, whom he no longer wants in his life; and Cindy, who he has never viewed as his sister. An incident at the party leads to the entire family needing to stay longer at Foxworth Manor. Bart has become fanatically religious like his great-grandparents, Malcolm and Olivia Foxworth, whom he idolizes. Malcolm's spirit lights through Bart, who tries to dictate his family's actions, acts on his warped view of the female gender based on his parents' relationship; and reconciles his own animal urges against his/Malcolm's religious beliefs.
