Shot in the real-life contemporary art world, FEMALE HUMAN ANIMAL is a psychothriller about a creative woman disenchanted with what modern life has to offer her. When writer Chloe Aridjis curates the Tate retrospective of the surrealist Leonora Carrington, an elusive, brooding man appears, seeming to offer more. Enabled by the artworks' defiant mystery, Chloe pursues him. But as she descends into a world of obsession, is she hunter or hunted? A darkly romantic enactment of a woman going beyond societal norms, it puts on screen the lurid unconscious of our new sexual politics. Featuring the Volksbuhne's Marc Hosemann, appearances from cultural figures like Juliet Jacques, Marina Warner, Adam Thirlwell, Stewart Home and Tom McCarthy, scored by Andy Cooke with new music from TEARIST and electronica originators O.M.D., Female Human Animal also pays homage to its guiding feminist spirit, the iconic artist and writer Leonora Carrington.
