Jay doesn't believe in love Stories, and Simran, is a girl who's in love with the idea of Love itself.
Born from a Gujarati mother and a Punjabi father, Mumbai-based Bollywood Art Director, Simran, is in love with her childhood sweetheart, Raj Dholakia, who is also her mother's choice. Then her employer, Veer Kapoor, assigns a slacker-Casanova, Jay Dhingra, to work as her subordinate. Jay turns on his charm - albeit in vain - and almost gets fired. Both eventually patch-up and get engrossed in the making of a movie 'Pyar Pyar Pyar'. During the filming, Simran admits that she has fallen in love with him, and even breaks up with Raj, but Jay rejects her. Heartbroken, she returns to Raj - who welcomes her back, and they are all set to wed. It is then Jay realizes that he may be in love, and wants to meet and apologize to her.
