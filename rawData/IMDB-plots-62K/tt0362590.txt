It just isn't David's day. First he gets fired at the bank, then his fiancee breaks up and throws him out of the house. The bank gets robbed and he gets shot. Twists follow.
"Employee of the Month" is about a guy whose day spirals from bad to worse when he gets fired from his dream job at the bank and is dumped by his fiancée Sara. David's best friend Jack tries to convince him it's for the best, but the opposite occurs when bank robberies and millions of dollars become part of his day from hell.
David Walsh has a perfect life: a gorgeous fiancée, Sarah Goodwin; a beautiful house; a fancy car; a job of manager in a bank. On the day he expects to be elected "The Employee of the Month", he is fired; Sarah finds that he had an affair with his colleague Wendy and calls off their engagement; and a hooker sent by his friend Jack to stay with him in a motel steals his car. On the next day, in his farewell, there is a heist in the bank and he is abducted. But his fate before reaching Nirvana has not finished yet.
