Rocco (Osvaldo Benavides) and Rodrigo (Rodrigo Cachero) are cousins, but they're not at all alike. Rocco is the loose one, Rodrigo's uptight. But when their grandfather Rodrigo Carnicero (Xavier Masse) dies, the two are forced to hit the road in an old car provided by the late Rodrigo and take the old man's ashes to the sea. The cousins clash, bond and finally reach their destination. There, they have an eye-opening series of experiences as they try to fulfill their grandfather's last wishes.
