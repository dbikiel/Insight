Two Tokyo co-workers come across a destitute young lady in search of a place to live.
After the death of his wife, a man struggles to raise his son in nearly overwhelming poverty. When the father meets a beautiful young woman, the son becomes jealous of his father's attentions, and conflict arises between them.
From "Ozu" by Donald Richie: "A subtle and beautiful film about a boy and his father who live together in a tenement, the father working, the boy going to school. The father is attracted to a younger woman, and though nothing comes of it, the boy is worried and disappointed. Offered a new job in a distant town, thefather goes off only to leave halfway there to return to his son."
