Texan debutante Valentine Ransome tries to reform a bankrupt playboy.
Playboy Jonathan Blair wakes up after a night on the town to find that Texan Valentine Ransome has escorted him home. Val is attracted to Jonathan but, finding that his life is aimless and his family shipping company almost bankrupt, she decides to reform him first and marry him later. Aiding her is Jonathan's unctuous butler, Butch; in her way is his fianc√©e, ditzy actress Carol. Lots of slapstick.
Texas socialite Valentine Ransome sets out to reform playboy Jonathan Blair and also to break up his engagement with actress Carol Wallace. Happy-go-lucky Blair has inherited a big steamship company which, under his guidance (or lack of) is rapidly approaching bankruptcy. She buys the company and puts him in charge, hoping he will mend his ways but he thinks she is trying to ruin him and is definitely meddling in his affairs.
