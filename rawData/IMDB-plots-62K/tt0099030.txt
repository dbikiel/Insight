Five people spend the night in an abandoned house, the Amityville haunted house, and soon find themselves terrorized by assorted ghosts, venomous insects and ghostly apparitions.
Utterly unaware of its dark past, Marvin and his wife, Debbie, decide to buy the evil Amityville House to make a profit. However--as the couple along with the newlyweds, Abigail and Frank, and their friend, Bill, start to renovate the ramshackle colonial mansion--right from the start, supernatural occurrences begin to happen, and Debbie starts having terrifying nightmares. Are those horrible visions connected to the brutal murder of the local priest years before, or are they a warning from beyond? Can the unsuspecting residents escape from the Amityville curse?
