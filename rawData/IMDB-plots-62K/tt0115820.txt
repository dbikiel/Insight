When an American family moves into a haunted mansion in England, the family's teenage daughter could be the key in fulfilling a prophecy and finally set the house's ghost free.
When a teenaged girl moves to England with her brothers and parents into the ancient Canterville Hall, she's not at all happy. Especially as there's a ghost and a mysterious re-appearing bloodstain on the hearth. She campaigns to go back home, and her dad, believing the ghost's pranks are Ginny's, is ready to send her back. But then Ginny actually meets the elusive seventeenth century Sir Simon de Canterville (not to mention the cute teenaged Duke next door), and she sets her hand to the task of freeing Sir Simon from his curse.
Ginny Otis is a teenage girl who moves to England with her family to inhabit creaky old Canterville Hall. She lobbies for her father to send her back home, and is even more adamant when she encounters a ghost and an inexplicable bloodstain. But when Ginny befriends the ghost, Sir Simon de Canterville, and meets the attractive Duke of Cheshire, she decides she wants to stay and help Sir Simon escape his centuries-long curse.
The ghost of Sir Simon de Canterville has been roaming his castle searching in vain for a brave descendant who will release him from the Canterville curse by performing a brave deed. An American family moves in and finds the ghost amusing, but a young girl in the family can release him, if she dares.
