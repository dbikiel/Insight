The disappearance of his child sends a man on a dark path to find the truth.
Julien travels constantly through work; his perpetual absence in his house has ruined his marriage. During a stopover in France, he receives a message from his very anguished ex-wife: Mathys, his seven-year-old son, has disappeared. Julien begins the search for his son. It will stop at nothing to recover the child.
After years of estrangement, Julien receives a desperate phone call from his ex-wife, Marie, informing him that their seven-year-old boy, Mathys, has gone missing a day earlier, somewhere in the snow-capped forests of eastern France. As disturbing and intimate questions arise over the boy's unexplained disappearance, horrid suspicions paired with Julien's profound guilt that keeps building up will soon have him wandering in the snow, embarking on a wild goose chase to solve the mystery. Just how far will the pained parent go to retrieve his only son?
