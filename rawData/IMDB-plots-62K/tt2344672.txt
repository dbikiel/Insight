A wrongdoer is caught red-handed and he is not going to forgive the man who exposed him.
The film begins in a Christian seminary where two principle characters, Sam Fernandez (Arvind Swamy) a devoted good man meets Bergman (Arjun), who is more interested in having a good time. They have serious differences and choose different paths. Sam takes the way leading to the lord while Bergman takes to smuggling and other nefarious activities. Sam comes to a coastal village as a local priest and reforms a wayward young boy Thomas (Gautham Karthik), who becomes very close to him. Thomas falls in love with Beatrice (Thulasi Nair), an innocent girl. Due to certain machinations of Bergman, the poor priest Sam is framed and sent to jail. The satanic Bergman also brings Thomas under his tutelage and the truth also comes out that Beatrice is his daughter!
