A cross-country airliner, whose passengers include a nuclear physicist, a rocket expert, and a mathematical genius, is drawn beyond radar range by an unknown, unbreakable force.
A transcontinental flight from Los Angeles to Washington DC, carrying three top scientists, unexplainedly begins a climb to 10 miles up. With all other passengers unconscious, the scientists find themselves in a dimension where time does not exist. There they are put on trial by denizens of the future for their potential involvement in the creation of "the ultimate weapon."
Nuclear scientist Dr. Carl Morris is en route to Washington D. C. to present plans for a super-bomb designed to devastate entire nations. Traveling with him is his research assistant, Marcia Paxton, and a young rocket-propulsion expert, Tom Endicott. The airliner won't respond to its controls and zooms upward out of the earth's atmosphere, where it comes to rest atop a cloud-shrouded plateau. While the rest of the passengers are in a trance, Morris, Paxton and Endicott are taken before a Heavenly Tribunal and judged by a Jury of the Future. They are sentenced to be suspended for all Time to ensure that their death=dealing bomb plans will be halted. But a figure known as The Sage convinces the Tribunal that prayer alone is all that can save the future.
