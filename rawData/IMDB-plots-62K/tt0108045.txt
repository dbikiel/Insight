An accountant beleaguered by personal and professional problems gets involved with a femme fatale and her mysterious psychiatrist.
The super-fool Jim, a West Coast stockbroker, has newly separated from his wife, Gail. He's more than ready to be suckered when shapely mall sylph Ellie slips him a note reading "Save me." She angers Jim with woeful reports of abuse at the hands of her live-in lover, psychiatrist Oliver. Soon, a car chases Jim and shots are fired at him. Jim is meant to believe Moran is the attacker. Yeah, right. After Moran is killed by an unseen someone with Jim's gun, our hero is further bamboozled by foreign-accented phone calls that threaten to tell the cops. Jim can't imagine who this interloper could be, though a few scenes earlier his reptilian office nemesis Robbins had declared for the umpteenth time his intent to nail Jim and get Ellie all to himself.
