In this Swing Symphony cartoon things are hopping on an Arabian desert when local tribesmen gather at the Adobe Club for an evening of middle-eastern jitterbugging, boogie-woogie and truckin'. A very-shapely-indeed girl is dancing to a song about Abou Ben Boogie, the Oriental Rug Cutter, whose advances toward the girl are thwarted by a dancing camel. The dancer manages to elude Ben Boogie and all the other wolfish attendees.
