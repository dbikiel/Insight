When the father teaches his son in-law about the perks of cheating, things take unexpected turns...
Ondrej, a timid and reserved man, is in a monotonous marriage with Alice. On the contrary, his promiscuous father-in-law Rudolf who lives next door has a happy marriage of 35 years with Marta. As his marriage gets increasingly boring, Rudolf encourages him to imitate him to save his marriage. He rejects it but he changes his mind after he meets Sarlota, a new date of Rudolf.
Charming bon vivant Rudolf is convinced that infidelity is the basis for a happy marriage, since, after all, a woman does not want to be bored with her partner. Therefore, it is better to keep her fighting for him.Rudolf, now in his sixties, has successfully applied his wild theory in everyday practice. Obviously, he does not understand the naivety of his son-in-law Andrew, who tries to be a dutiful husband. He decides to try to help him; after all, he is the husband of his only daughter.
