As the migratory songbirds are sold by the thousands to the black market, the members of the Committee Against Bird Slaughter wage war against the poachers. But, can they change the world's point of view, freeing one bird at a time?
Based on a magazine essay written by noted best-selling novelist Jonathan Franzen for 'The New Yorker' and widely republished around the world, 'Emptying the Skies' chronicles the rampant poaching of migratory songbirds in southern Europe. Songbird populations have been drastically declining for several decades, and a number of species face extinction imminently. The film explores the wonder of these tiny globe-flying marvels, millions of which are unlawfully slaughtered each year for large sums on the black market, and follows an intrepid squad of pan-European bird-lovers who risk their lives waging a secret war against poachers, disrupting illegal trapping and freeing as many birds as possible. Jonathan Franzen is executive producer of and featured in the film.
As the tiny migratory songbirds which pass through the Mediterranean for their seasonal migration to Africa are still considered an exotic culinary delicacy, thousands of them are illegally captured and sold to the clandestine nets of a lucrative black market. Inspired by Jonathan Franzen's 2010 article for the New Yorker, "Emptying the Skies" follows the passionate and dedicated members of the Committee Against Bird Slaughter, as they wage war against the multitudes of poachers and their evil contraptions used for trapping and mutilating the inhabitants of the skies. But, can the bird-loving guerrillas change the world's point of view, freeing one little bird at a time?
