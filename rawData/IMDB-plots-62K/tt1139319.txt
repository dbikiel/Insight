A broke, jobless actor and a broke, jobless screenwriter set out to make a movie and then find that life starts imitating art.
Mark is a wannabe actor, penniless, clueless, and inept. He cares for a brother who's paraplegic, and he has a girlfriend, Sally, who wants out of the relationship. His idea of life is to go to the occasional audition, dodge his landlord (having spent the rent money Sally gave him), give Sally a hang-dog look, and talk with Pearce, who lives upstairs. Mark's flat is in disrepair: the kitchen window slams shut, bits of plaster fall from the ceiling, a bulb fizzes, and the sitting-room chandelier sways. When an awful accident happens, Mark freezes, which precipitates additional accidents; he finally calls Pearce, perhaps the worst decision possible. Will Mark come to his senses?
An actor hard on his luck ends up with a large number of dead bodies on his hands. Together with his hilarious friend they hatch a genius plan of treating their predicament like a film scenario and try to rewrite the day. As the body count mounts, they pitch ideas back and forth desperately searching for a way out.
