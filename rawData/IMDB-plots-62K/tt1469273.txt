Tom Murray presents his brother Chris (1960- ), through Chris's relationship to their mother, their father, who died when Chris was about 20, to Tom, to the two jobs Chris has in New Haven as a janitor and a supermarket stock boy, and to his art, sold through KS Art, a New York City gallery. Chris is autistic, living on his own for more than 30 years, navigating public transportation, affectionate with his mom and brother, certain that his father is in Heaven, keeping his eye on his sons and friends with Richard Nixon, a foe on earth. Chris's creations are cheerful landscapes of New York buildings, meticulously done in multi-media. He likes his life, just as it is.
