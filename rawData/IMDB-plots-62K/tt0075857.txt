Hunters wound a grizzly bear in a national forest in Alaska. Soon after, the wounded bear goes off and kills several other hunters, hikers, campers, the sheriff and a little boy scout. Jason Evers sets out to stop it in the frozen plains of the Alaska mountains.
"Claws!' is about a grizzly bear who is wounded by three hunters one year. From then on, the bear goes on a killing spree in the woods, trying to take revenge on humans as a whole for its brush with the hunters. Jason and Chris Monroe, estranged husband and wife, go in search of the bear after it kills their only son, Buck.
