It deals with the story of Baddi Krishna (Yash),who will be a cool dude in the town. Ananth Nag, who will be the Matadhipathi(chief of temple) will decide to make Baddi Krishna as his successor.Though Krishna will not be interested in the traditional and religious practices,situation will leads him towards that post.
Krishna(Yash) is a happy go lucky guy also an ambitious guy. When he was born his father vowed to make him a pontiff. But he was not interested in that. The existing pontiff(Ananth Nag) asks him to get an elephant instead of becoming a pontiff. He goes to a forest for that. Rana(John Vijay) wants to make it a resort which is a threat to elephant. He starts protecting the forest. But he is unaware that he was Bahubali in his previous birth who was a great warrior. Will he realise that fights back with Rana and save the forest forms the rest of the story.
