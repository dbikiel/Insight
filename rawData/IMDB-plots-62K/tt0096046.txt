Criminals hijack a plane and force the pilot and his daughter to fly them to Mexico. However, an unexpected landing finds them in a cemetery inhabited by killer scarecrows.
Five people heist the Camp Pendleton payroll, kidnap a pilot and his daughter, who are forced to fly them to Mexico. Enroute a double cross has one of the thieves parachute with the loot into an abandoned graveyard surrounded by strange scarecrows. Two of the team jump after their loot and their former partner. Everything happens during the course of one very dark night.
Five criminals find themselves parachuting, with their "ill-gotten goods" into an abandoned cemetary. But this bone-yard is guarded by some nasty scarecrows, and they aren't made of straw. Another schlocky, fun "living dead" movie, the genre of which influenced Rob Zombie for "House of Wax".
