Three thugs commandeer a couple of cars on a moving train and spread terror among the passengers.
Almost ten passengers are traveling in a bed-car on a long-trip train. Among them there are a prostitute, a pair of couples, some girls, a policeman and three violent boys. The three guys succeeded to steal the policeman's gun, taking also the control of some cars of the train. Soon humiliations, raping and murdering are perpetrated to passengers. An unexpected stop could change the situation giving to Pierre a former prisoner the chance for revenge.
