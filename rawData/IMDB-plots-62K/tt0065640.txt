Paola (Nadia Cassini) is in a deteriorating marriage with Bernard (Galeazzo Bentivoglio). After the couple move to an island in the Caribbean, Paola befriends a local woman named Stella (Beryl Cunningham) who introduces her to the cult of the serpent god Djamballà. Paola, first despising the rituals of the cult, soon realizes that they represent the passion and lust lacking in her married life. At a ritual where reality is interspersed within fantasy, Paola has sex with a strong black man (Evaristo Márquez) she identifies with the serpent god himself. After her husband's sudden death, she invites her former lover Tony (Sergio Tramonti) to the island to start a new life but understands that Djamballà has become her sole obsession.
A beautiful Italian woman, Paola (Nadia Cassini) is told by her black friend (Evaristo Márquez) about the Carribean love god Jambaya who appears in the form of the snake. By the end of the movie, Paola decides to give herself to Jambaya while a local woman named Stella (Beryl Cunningham) departs with her white friend's ex-lover, establishing a neat symmetry between their respective fantasies of exoticism.
