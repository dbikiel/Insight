A singer and songwriter, who gave up his dream is entered into a Reality TV songwriting contest. But after losing the first two rounds, he takes on a win-at-all-costs attitude, even if winning means losing himself.
The One I Wrote For You is an inspirational, family-oriented feature film set to release in 2014. The movie tells the heartwarming story of Ben Cantor, a talented, 30-something songwriter and musician who gets a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to finally hit it big when his precocious ten-year old daughter secretly enters him into a Reality TV show songwriting contest. Though burned by a record deal years ago, past his "prime" to make it as a pop star and concerned they'll change who he is, Cantor enters the contest after being encouraged by his wife, Alicia, and former manager, Mickey. As he struggles through his doubts and overcomes formidable opponents in the competition, Ben's journey captures the hearts of millions of viewers - including his own daughter and wife - touching all those who follow his rise to stardom, fall from grace, and eventual return to what matters most: his family.
