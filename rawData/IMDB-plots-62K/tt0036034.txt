Propaganda film about a family that won't allow the military to grow crops on their fields due to their superstitious beliefs about their son's illness, with sub-plots about about the family's heirloom sword and a blossoming romance.
A superstitious farming family is hesitant to use their prized fallow fields to grow crops to help feed the nation's troops. Kinoshita's rural drama was made to promote the war effort, but his story branches off in many directions, including one subplot about the family's heirloom samurai sword and another about a blossoming young romance.
