Some gnomes are searching for a wonderful spider that weaves webs of golden coins. Intent on their search, they are unaware that their movements are closely followed by a poor woodcutter, who also penetrates into their caves when they have caught the spider and imprisoned it there. He watches the wonderful spider making gold and other articles with wonder and in this scene the moving picture camera has excelled itself in turning out some good tricks, and finally he steals the golden spider. He returns to his hut and the spider spins numerous gold coins, but he becomes miserly so that when a poor beggar asks for help he refuses. Immediately his golden hoard changes into a mass of crawling insects and the accusing faces of the gnomes rise in the background.
