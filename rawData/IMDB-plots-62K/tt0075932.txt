Timid, discreet, and humble, the guileless nineteen-year-old assistant hairdresser, Pomme, lives with her doting mother and works in a Parisian beauty salon. When Pomme's only friend and polar opposite--the experienced, sensuous and independent beautician, Maryl√®ne--decides to take her along on a vacation at the heart of Normandy, in the chic seaside resort of Cabourg, the virginal woman has a chance encounter with the cultivated literature student, Francois. Head-over-heels in love with each other, the young and inexperienced couple returns to Paris with big dreams; however, life is as exciting as it is complicated. Now, one of the ardent lovers has a change of heart. Is Francois and Pomme's cold separation inevitable?
