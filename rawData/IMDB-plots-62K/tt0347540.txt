Over one night in New York City, lives of disparate strangers intersect by fate and circumstance.
When emotionally troubled stockbroker Rick suddenly re-proposes to his wife of 10 years at a cocktail party, only to be rejected and humiliated by her, his illusory world of comfort and security comes crashing down. No feelings are spared in the huge fight that ensues as both parties spill out into the street. Under the cover of darkness of the New York City streets, the two take separate paths that will test both the fragility and resilience of their psyches.
