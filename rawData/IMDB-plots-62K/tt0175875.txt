Based on a story by Mariya Khalfina. Shura Olevantseva leads a happy life with her children and her loving husband Pavel. One day she hears the news that the woman, who once loved her husband, died and that Sveta, Pavel's daughter about whom he knew nothing, is now an orphan. It wasn't easy for Shura to welcome Sveta into her home. It was even more difficult to win her heart, and to give her back the joy of childhood and the belief that she's not alone.
