Dirty Fred (Justin Rice) and Bruho (Leo Fitzpatrick) are free-wheeling squatters with a taste for off-season vacation homes in the Catskills. Their commitment to the lifestyle is challenged, however, when a runaway teen and an aimless young woman join their ranks.
Dirty Fred (Justin Rice) and Bruho (Leo Fitzpatrick) arent sanguine about the future. Convinced that dwindling petroleum resources will soon bring the modern world to a halt, theyve dropped out of productive (and vehicular) society, choosing instead a life of free-wheeling vagabondage. Their method is to squat in off-season vacation homes until they run out of food or are chased off, but the pattern changes when they admit a runaway teen (Brian Charles Johnson) and an aimless young woman (Laura Campbell) to their peculiar tribe.
