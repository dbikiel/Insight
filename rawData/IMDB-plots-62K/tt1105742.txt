A young girl finds out some disturbing supernatural truths about her father, who has been a suspect to multiple murder cases.
Sweet young Melanie Blaine returns to her small backwoods country hometown of Gibbington to check on her estranged ex-sheriff father Howard, who's the primary suspect in a series of grisly murders. Nice guy local Jimmy Fuller helps Melanie out. Melanie eventually finds her dad and discovers that something not human and much more sinister than a mere mortal man is responsible for the killings.
The dark secrets of a small town (Gibbington) in America's deep south are revealed after a series of gruesome murders. When the local police accuse local resident and former-sheriff Howard Blaime of the latest crime (the pretty blond homecoming queen dies in the swamp), he goes into hiding. After receiving notice that her estranged father, Howard (Bruce Dern), is dying, Melanie Blaime (Cindy Sampson) returns home after being away 17 years. Upon her arrival, her creepy friend Jimmy Fuller (Nicolas Wright) admits that Melanies father is not dying but is on the run from the law. Jimmy's mother is more than a bit creepy, herself. With her command of "electricity", she brings dead watches back to life and hangs them on walls, cures migraines, and who knows what else.After the sheriff is also killed, it is evident that the perpetrator isn't Melanie's father. Melanie attempts to clear her father's name of the trumped-up charges, but she soon discovers that the real killer isn't even human. For those who only watch movies with more than a bit of nudity, this movie will disappoint - all the pretty females remain clothed. There isn't much foul language and, were it not for the horror genre, the family themes would make this a decent family movie.
