A jazz cartoon involving a "Fats Waller"-like cat who leaves the "Uncle Tomcat Mission" for the local jazz club.
A fat cat (a caritcture of Fats Waller) is walking down the street scatting, when he comes upon a club called "The Kit-Kat Club". On the way in, he walks by a place called "Uncle Tomcat Mission", where a gospel singer warns him not to enter the club, and to beware of "wine, women, and song". The cat replies "Well, wats de motta wit dat?", and walks in the club. After playing some piano, he is blasted out of this world with a wild trumpet solo. He lands in a world similar to that in "Porky in Wackyland"(1938).
