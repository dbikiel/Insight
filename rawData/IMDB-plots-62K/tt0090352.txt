Set in the 60's. In a small provincial town four high school teenagers are facing the graduation, but all that is on their minds is how to woo the home crowd to a concert full of Beatles hits, played by their band. They do not have amplifiers to do the show, so they put together some makeshift equipment which eventually leaves one of them electrocuted.
