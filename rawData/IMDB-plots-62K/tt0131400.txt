Featuring the characters from Murray Ball's "Footrot Flats", (New Zealand's most beloved local cartoon strip ). Questions to be answered include: Will Wal Footrot win the affections of Cheeky Hobson over the sleazy Spit Murphy? Will the Dog win the affections of the lovely Jess? Will Wal make a good impression on the All Black selectors at Saturdays rugby match? Can Rangi and Pongo save Cooch's prize stag from the depths of Blackwater station, home of the Murphy's, their vicious dogs and deadly croco-pigs? All this and more will be answered as the small town of Raupo comes to life on the big screen.
