Johnny Jackson, a sleazy talent agent, discovers teenager Bert Rudge singing in a coffee house. Despite Bert's protestation that he really is only interested in playing bongos, Johnny starts him on the road to stardom. The deal they cut, however, is highly exploitative of the young singer, and their relationship soon begins to go bad.
Johnny Jackson's an agent in 1950's Soho; on the make; for a kid with just enough talent to become famous (make a lot of money - for Johnny). One day, he comes across singer, Bert Rudge, and realises he's on to a winner. Renaming him 'Bongo Herbert', and launching his career on television, he seems to have hit the jackpot. But whilst Johnny's greedy, he's also very naive, and up till now, he never had to handle a successful artist. But, very soon he's out of his league.
