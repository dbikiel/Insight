An ostrich is trying to learn how to fly in a dessert.
We see the sultry desert. Almost naked, almost lifeless. But, in it there are lizards, insects, there are also ostriches. And once - once met an ostrich and a griffin. The ostrich is very shy; and then one day he meets the griffin. He offers to keep him company. Ostrich agrees. Griffin flies, the ostrich runs after him.
