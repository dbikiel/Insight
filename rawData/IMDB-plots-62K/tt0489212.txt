A dark comedy which chronicles the final day in the life of self-proclaimed artist and genius, K. Roth Binew. Binew is a dreamer who elevates his drab and somewhat pitiful existence into a personal mythology. For his final day K. Roth Binew enlists his best friend, the unrecognized poet and biographer Mills Joquin to chronicle his final hours. Mills Joquin drives Binew around town on a bicycle-powered rickshaw. As the eccentric duo go about their day, Binew hands out invitations to his final party, a living wake, where Binew will do a short performance before dropping dead on the spot.
