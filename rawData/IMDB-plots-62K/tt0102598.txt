A Chicago cop must balance loyalty to his overbearing mother and a relationship with a shy funeral home worker.
Danny, a cop, meets and falls in love with Theresa. They get engaged, despite sneaking around behind his mother's back, but when push comes to shove, he can't quite quit worrying about his mother long enough to be any kind of lover to Theresa.
Danny Muldoon is a 38 year old man who still lives with his Irish mother who has him on a short leash. When he meets Teresa, an Italian, his mother doesn't exactly approve of her. But he continues to see her. And eventually his brother arranges for him to get a job in Florida so that their mother can move there. But Teresa prefers to stay where she is. So Danny has to choose whom he wants to be with.
