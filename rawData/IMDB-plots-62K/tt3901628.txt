7.2 is an action-drama that follows Cleo, a schoolgirl, who regains consciousness to find herself lying on the ground with no memory of who she is, only to be confronted by Daisy, the school bully, who issues a cryptic ultimatum. What follows is a race against time in which Cleo must deal with the bully and save herself from disembowelment. Ascending the school floor by floor she defeats various foes and finds out more about herself on what becomes a journey of self discovery. 7.2 is about being a teenage girl today. Riffing on action classics including The Bourne Identity, The Matrix and Bruce Lee's Game of Death, and packed with snappy dialogue and witty one-liners, 7.2 is as funny as it is brutal.
