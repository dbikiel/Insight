Set a decade after the U.S.S Voyager's return to Earth, a rag-tag crew of renegades and outcasts must covertly work with Admiral Chekov and Tuvok to stop forces threatening the Federation from outside, and within.
When a seemingly unstoppable new enemy threatens the very existence of the Earth, Admiral Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig) is forced to work outside the boundaries of Starfleet's rules to combat this deadly new foe. When planet after planet winks out of existence, yet Starfleet refuses to act, Chekov turns to Commander Tuvok (Tim Russ, who also directs), the new head of Starfleet's covert operations division, Section 31. Together, they assemble a new elite strike-force, consisting of rogues, outcasts and criminals, led by the fearless yet haunted Lexxa Singh (Adrienne Wilkinson). The Renegades' mission is simple: take on an army and stop their leader, Borrada (Bruce Young), from destroying the Earth. Outnumbered and out-gunned, the ragtag crew is in an adrenaline-pumping race against time and space. But they soon find their foes are the least of their concerns: the real trouble may be coming from within!
Star Trek meets The Dirty Dozen in this exciting new Star Trek series about a group of rogues, rebels, and outcasts who find themselves faced with the greatest threat the Federation has ever encountered. With Admiral Chekov (Walter Koenig) heading up Starfleet Intelligence and Tuvok (Tim Russ) a part of Starfleet's clandestine Section 31 organization, they recruit Captain Lexxa Singh (Adrienne Wilkinson) and her rogue crew to do those missions that no one else can or will do. When the Federation is threatened and Starfleet protocol won't work, it is up to this rag-tag group of Renegades to save them all.
