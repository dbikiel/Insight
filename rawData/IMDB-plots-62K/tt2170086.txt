Breathtaking, fantastic and inspiring short film which explores the theme of love through expressive figure drawings and contemporary dance.
Weightless, as if floating in a limitless airy space, the lithe and strong body of a male dancer incarnates the thought and the sweet resonance of a restless new-found love, embodies the all-consuming fascination of a vehement and unbounded passion, and in the end, manifests the silent, yet wrenching sorrow of a love lost.
