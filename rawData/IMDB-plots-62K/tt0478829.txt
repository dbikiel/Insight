A twelve-year-old piano prodigy who suffocates from his parent's big dreams for him decides to make his escape--and with the aid of his grandfather--chase his own dreams instead.
The film tells the story of a highly-gifted boy whose parents have demanding and ambitious plans for him - they want him to become a pianist. However, one day the boy, Vitus, is no longer willing to comply with his parents' plans and ambitions because he wants to follow his own star.
Undeniably gifted and talented in every way, Vitus showed crystal-clear indications of nothing less than pure genius, even from the tender age of six, when he displayed a special fondness for playing the piano. Of course, his parents wouldn't let such profound talent go to waste--but, the more they both pushed a now twelve-year-old Vitus to pursue a career in music, the less "real" the young musical genius would become. In the end, only Vitus' grandfather is his true ally; however, can he show him how to be a truly normal kid of his age?
Helen and Leo von Holzen are blessed with a gifted and sensitive child. They name him Vitus and have plans to make him (and them) famous and rich. Vitus does display amazing skills at playing the piano, but also has a crush on a much older girl, Isabel, his babysitter. He offers friendship, but she prefers someone older, contrary to this boy-genius' theory that since a woman's libido matures faster than a males', the world would be a better place if women were married to males younger by at least 6 years. Aloof from other classmates, proving that he is much more smarter than his teachers, he withdraws into himself, but opens up a bit when in the company of his grandfather. Then when pressures from his parents increase, he refuses to follow the path that they have set for him and goes into a silent rebellion that will change everyone's lives forever.
