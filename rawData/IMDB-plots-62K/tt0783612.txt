An examination of the U.S. government's response to Hurricane Katrina.
In August 2005, the American city of New Orleans was struck by the powerful Hurricane Katrina. Although the storm was damaging by itself, that was not the true disaster. That happened when the city's flooding safeguards like levees failed and put most of the city, which is largely below sea level, underwater. This film covers that disastrous series of events that devastated the city and its people. Furthermore, the gross incompetence of the various governments and the powerful from the local to the federal level is examined to show how the poor and underprivileged of New Orleans were mistreated in this grand calamity and still ignored today.
Spike Lee documents life in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina destroyed the city's anti-flooding safeguards in 2005. In the film, New Orleans residents tell their stories and vent their anger -- some calmly, some with unbridled rage -- at the callousness displayed by their local, state and national leaders. Survivors share their own heartbreaking tales, leveling charges and challenges at the officials who failed to protect their lives, their homes and their city.
