In Wyoming, several ranchers have their prized mares stolen by a big wild white stallion and must recover them before the Governor's Stake trotting race day.
"Thunderhead," a roving, big white stallion, causes problems for the Wyoming ranchers when he leads their blue-blooded racing mares off to join his wild horse herd in the mountains. Escaping gunfire, he runs off one night with a young rancher;s mare, a possible winner of the Governor's Stake trotting race. The mare is recaptured and entered in the race against the horse owned by the father of the young rancher's sweetheart, and this puts a damper on their romance.
In this sequel to MY FRIEND FLICKA and THUNDERHEAD, young Ken McLaughlin buys a trotting horse named Crown Jewel, intending to train and race her. However, Thunderhead, the stallion he released to the wild, returns and steals Jewel to add to his herd. Ken gets Jewel back and also succeeds in bringing Thunderhead home before competing in a trotting race. His chief opponent is Beaver Greenway, a washed-up former champion driver whose granddaughter Ken is in love with.
