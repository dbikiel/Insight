Opportunistic con man Dan Kehoe ingratiates himself with the cantankerous mother of four outlaws and their beautiful widows in order to find their hidden gold.
Smooth cowboy Dan Kehoe arrives at a ranch run by an old widow and her four daughters-in-law. He's been tipped off that the proceeds of a gold robbery are hidden on the ranch, but only one of the women knows where. He plays them off against each other in his quest to discover the location.
Opportunistic con man, Dan Kehoe, is on the run when he stops off at a small town saloon and hears stories of the four notorious McDade Brothers. Three of the career outlaws were killed on their last job while one escaped... his identity unknown. Hearing that their $50,000 cache of stolen gold is hidden somewhere on the family ranch at Wagon Mount, Kehoe ignores warnings about their feisty mother, who dislikes visitors and is a crack shot, and ingratiates himself with the old woman with a phony story about meeting her surviving son in a jail cell. He also uses his charm on the four beautiful man-hungry McDade widows, who have stayed with their cantankerous mother-in-law for the past two years - each hoping that her husband is the surviving son and sole claimant to the money. Ma guards her daughter-in-law's chastity as tightly as the hidden gold and soon realizes that with Kehoe, she has let the fox into the henhouse.
