A powerfully intimate drama that captures the fears and desires of a young Japanese woman lost in the U.S., 'Littlerock' is an affectingly authentic portrait of the bitter-sweet pain of young love and the cruel reality of cultural miscommunication, making it one of the most moving independent U.S. films in recent memory.
When her car breaks down on a site-seeing tour of California, a Japanese student winds up stranded in a small desert town. Exhilarated by a sudden sense of freedom, she extends her stay and finds friendship, romance, and what promises to be a new home. But as she pulls back the layers on this unlikely paradise, she discovers a different America than the one in her dreams.
