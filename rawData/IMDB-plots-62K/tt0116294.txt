A race of extraterrestrial beings has evolved to the point that they only exist as beams of light. Not having any physical experiences in their collective memories, they send Kara (Venesa Talor) to Earth, in order for her to experience as many physical sensations as possible. Since Kara's physical appearance was created to be aesthetically beautiful, she has plenty of physical experiences with many people on Earth.
