This documentary questions who killed Victor Jara, Chilean musician and activist who died during the dictatorship in his country.
Known as Chile's Bob Dylan, Victor Jara was a fearless political singer who led the historic Nueva Cancion folk movement in Chile during the CIA-backed Pinochet dictatorship. Pinochet's regime eventually would torture and kill Jara - along with 3000 others - in the National Stadium, for writing a song about the covert killings.
