In 1950s Las Vegas, a gambling rancher and a ballerina discover that some people have luck at cards while others have luck at love.
Chuck Rodwell is a gambling cowboy who discovers that he's lucky at the roulette wheel if he holds hands with dancer Marie. However, Marie doesn't like to hold hands with him, at least not to begin with...
Rancher Chuck Rodwell's at the Sands in Vegas on his annual gambling holiday. Everyone at the Sands knows and welcomes Chuck, not only because he's good-natured, but because he's a perpetual loser in the games of chance in casino. Concurrently at the resort is Maria Corvier, a ballerina, whose manager, Pierre booked her on a lucrative 2-week stint at the resort's supper club purely as a springboard to better gig in New York City. Maria's all work and no play, and dislikes having to perform in a noisy supper club, . When the pair first meet, she's no time for him - seeing him as the typical Vegas type. Chuck thinks Maria's his lucky charm; he's winning whenever he holds her hand. Maria begins to believe the same, not only that she's his lucky charm, but that he also is hers. Despite their obvious differences, the 2 start to fall for each other. The strongest force may be the third; lady luck, and what would happen if she were to leave them.
