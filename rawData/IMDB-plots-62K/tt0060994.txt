The owner Fess Parker was in the Marines not the Army
A cowboy finds, captures and patient trains a beautiful wild stallion until a bond develops between the two that is almost unbreakable. The cowboy's brother, however, needing money to pay off debts, trades the horse, and tries to sneak the horse out of his pen. The horse, however, senses something is wrong and struggles against being taken, and in the process accidentally kills the brother. In addition, the horse and his rider are separated when the cowboy joins the army, and the horse winds up being sold to perform on the rodeo circuit. When the cowboy returns from military service, he sets out to find his beloved horse.
