The Seduction of Inga is Joseph Sarno's sizzling and controversial sequel to his 1967 erotic masterpiece, Inga, starring the young, voluptuous Swedish sensation Marie Liljedahl in her steamiest role ever.
Three years after the life-changing events, and after eloping with her first love, Karl, to Stockholm, a now nineteen-year-old Inga finds herself inconsolable, penniless, and abandoned at a cheap and squalid boarding house in Sweden. Unable to pay for her rent, she eventually lands a job as a secretary for the lonely author, Stig, who is still obsessed with his former girlfriend, Greta. Inevitably, Inga and Stig begin a steamy affair; however, things will take a turn for the unexpected when the young and seductive guitar player, Rolf, woos Inga. Now, Inga must make a decision, and brace herself for a shocking revelation. Can she handle the truth?
After her boyfriend leaves her alone and penniless, Inga can only long for the love of another man devoted to satisfying her body and soul. Rolf, a young pop singer and musician, tries his best to seduce her, but she ultimately falls for Stig - a dashing older man and writer. Stig owns a beautiful villa, and Inga gladly becomes his personal secretary - and lover. When business takes Stig away, Inga's loneliness and unfulfilled sensual desires lead her straight into the arms and bed of Rolf. Inga's life is further complicated by the arrival of the young and beautiful Greta Tillstrom who admits to an on-going affair with Stig and professes a blossoming attraction for Inga herself. As passions surge and forbidden lust is embraced, Inga will be forced to confront a shocking secret and reconcile an aching heart with a tireless young body that can't say no.
