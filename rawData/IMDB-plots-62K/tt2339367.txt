Trevor Newandyke is a struggling comedian. Not only does he bomb on stage, but he bombs in everyday life. To him, it's the little things that matter most. He's fed up with the threats from the cable company, 7-11 raising the price of the Slurpee, and all the jerks who think they can push him around. All he wants is a break, and for someone to get him. Not everyone, just someone. But instead of taking a breath and getting himself together or taking his anger to the stage, he turns to the loud din of his headphones and the crackling glow of fire to ease his mind. He's not only a lousy comic, but a pyromaniac, as well.
