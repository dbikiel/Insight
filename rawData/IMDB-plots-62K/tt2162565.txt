Adam, and a dog, in the Garden of Eden.
Dog walks Eden. Then one day he meets a strange creature, Adam. Side by side, they spend their days in the flourishing garden, and become inseparable companions - until a new creature arrives: Eve. After meeting this new companion, who is similar to him, Adam neglects Dog. But after the Fall of Man, when the two Humans must leave the Garden, he consorts with them into the realm of hardship.
Dog explores Eden alone curiously exploring creatures and plant life alike. He then meets a creature that approaches and bonds with him - he meets Adam. They venture together through this paradise inseparably until an indirect threat to their bond emerges: Eve. With this new arrival, Dog struggles to keep their connection close despite distance, hardships, and unspoken emotions leading to whatever end. He will not fail to be Adam's best friend.
In the enchanting and delightful Garden of Eden, a solitary dog wanders the unspoiled landscape inconspicuously. And then, unexpectedly, the little dog encounters God's newest creation, the human Adam, and intrigued, interacts with him and soon befriends him. However, as the two companions explore the wonders of the magnificent and lush garden, the red-haired Eve is introduced to this world, disrupting the fine balance of things.
