Canadian comic Katherine Ryan explains the perks of dating younger men. She talks about her unusual relationships, living in the hometown she hates and how she once enraged an entire nation.
This video is from Canadian stand-up comedienne Katherine Ryan's 2015 tour. She moved to England in 2008 where she is well known from many appearances on British television. The venue for this performance was in Hammersmith, London, England. It was at the Eventim Apollo and showcases Ryan's comedy. The advice often given to writers is to 'write what you know.' Ryan follows that advice and bases her stand-up comedy on her own life. The routine begins with audience participation where she talks directly to audience members, draws out laughter and breaks the imaginary barrier with the audience. After about 10 minutes she moves to talking about her life: her dating woes, accepting unsolicited advice, being single and raising a daughter. Throughout her performance, she interacts with the audience as she comments on her life. Like all good stand-up, she looks at real life in a slightly off-center way. The stories she tells are worth listening to.
