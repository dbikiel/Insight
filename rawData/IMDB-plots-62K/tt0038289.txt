A young Irish woman hates England so much she becomes a Nazi spy.
Determined, independent Bridie Quilty comes of age in 1944 Ireland thinking all Englishmen are devils. Her desire to join the IRA meets no encouragement, but a German spy finds her easy to recruit. We next find her working in a pub near a British military prison, using her sex appeal in the service of the enemy. But chance puts a really vital secret into her hands, leading to a chase involving Bridie, a British officer who's fallen for her, a German agent unknown to them both, and the police...paralleled by Bridie's own internal conflicts.
1944. Twenty-one year old Bridie Quilty grew up in the small Irish town of Ballygarry listening to her now deceased father Danny Quilty's highly exaggerated and fantastical stories of fighting during the Irish Revolution, those stories which Bridie could recite verbatim. From those stories which she believed wholeheartedly, she developed a hatred for the British, most specifically the British military, especially Oliver Cromwell. Now at the age of majority, Bridie, without telling her family or friends in Ballygarry her complete intentions, decides to move away to support her pro-Irish/anti-British alliances in whatever way she can. When her initial plan to join the IRA in Dublin falls through, she, upon a chance meeting with a man on a train, decides to head to England - Wynbridge - to work as a spy for Germany, her responsibilities largely to use her feminine wiles to gather low level intelligence from British officers. Instead of the romanticized view of the world she had in Ballygarry, she is exposed for the first time in her life to the hard cold realities of the world and of the current war. What ends up happening to her is largely affected by David Baynes, a British officer, who just won't leave her alone as he falls in love with her.
