Long-missing Bill Cardew returns to find his wife Vicky remarried...and in no hurry to settle for just one husband.
It's been a year since Bill Cardew was declared dead by drowning, and his widow Vicky is now married to his old friend and business partner, Henry Lowndes. When Bill unexpectedly returns from the island where he was marooned, what is Vicky to do? Well, having twice been a rather neglected wife, Vicky finds all the attention from two husbands competing for her favors delightful, and is in no hurry to make a decision...much to the discomfiture of hapless Bill and Henry.
Bill Cardew and Henry Lowndes were business partners and best friends up until Bill's supposed death when he drowned on one of his adventure vacations. A year after Bill's death, Henry has decided to take Bill's name off their business partnership, which irks Henry's wife, Vicky Lowndes, as Vicky is the widowed former Mrs. Bill Cardew. Vicky loved Bill during their marriage, and loves Henry now in their marriage, but in both, has felt slightly neglected, playing second fiddle to Bill's adventure vacations and Henry's focus on the business. Life for the Lowndeses hits some complications when Bill returns home, he who obviously did not drown on his adventure vacation, but was marooned on a deserted island for a year. Bill expects to return to his former life with Vicky, but it is not as simple as he being Vicky's first husband. Both men love Vicky, and Vicky loves both men. But before she can decide with who she wants to spend her life - if she can indeed decide - she relishes in the fact that her husbands are paying her more attention now than they ever have.
