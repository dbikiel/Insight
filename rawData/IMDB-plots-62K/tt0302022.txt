Compiled over two years, an 'on-camera oral history' of Easy Company, told by the veterans themselves. Accompanies the mini-series Band of Brothers.
Over a period of two years, Mark Cowen and his crew travelled to 30 U.S. and ten European cities, to interview the veterans of Easy Co. The stories, told by the veterans themselves, create a history of the Second World War from the point of view of this heroic company of men, made famous in the mini-series Band of Brothers.
A companion piece to Band of Brothers (2001) this documentary interviews many of the surviving members of Easy Company who recall their campaigns in World War II. They discuss their training in Georgia, leaving the US for England, D Day action, Operation Market Garden, holding the line at Bastogne and being the first Allied troops in Berchtesgaden. They reminisce about their comrades-in-arms, both the survivors and those who didn't make it home.
