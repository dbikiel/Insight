With her parents dead, an already unstable teenager embarks on a blood-soaked journey of torture, violence, and retribution, as everyone unlucky enough to cross paths with her ends up dead. Is the brutal Sick Girl capable of mercy?
Seriously messed-up young gal Izzy isn't having an easy time of it: Both her parents are dead, her older brother Rusty is fighting overseas in Iraq, and she has to raise her younger brother Kevin by herself. Moreover, Izzy lets off steam by not only killing people, but also by torturing several folks she has tied up in the barn right next to her house. After catching a trio of bullies picking on Kevin in school, Izzy blows a gasket and embarks on a vicious rampage.
With her older brother away at war in Iraq and her parents dead, the already unstable teenager, Izzy, is left all alone to look after her nine-year-old brother, Kevin, on the vacant family farm. Having a special knack for getting into trouble, Izzy embarks on a blood-soaked journey of torture, violence, and retribution, as nearly everyone unlucky enough to cross paths with her--including a school bus of Catholic schoolgirls--ends up dead. Now, three bullies are about to experience firsthand the unhinged Izzy's rabid ferocity. Is the brutal Sick Girl capable of mercy?
