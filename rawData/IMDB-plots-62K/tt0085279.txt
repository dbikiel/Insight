The dashing Captain Hugh "Bullshot" Crummond (Alan Shearman) - World War I ace fighter pilot, Olympic athlete, racing driver, part-time sleuth, and all round spiffing chap - must save the world from the dastardly Count Otto van Bruno (Ronald E. House), his wartime adversary. And, of course, win the heart of a jolly nice young lady.
