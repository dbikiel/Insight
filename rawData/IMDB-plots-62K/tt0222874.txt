Deep into a vast cavern of the pitch-black inferno, a couple of professional dancers demonstrate the cakewalk that is currently so much in vogue, and now, everyone in the once-gloomy underworld is doing the crazy dance. Who is the best?
Deep into a vast and high-ceilinged cavern of the pitch-black inferno, a black servant of hell introduces a couple of professional dancers to demonstrate the cakewalk--the satirical dance which originates from the late 19th-century black America and is currently so much in vogue. All of a sudden, a grotesque demon sprouts out of an enormous cake, performing his version of the popular dance; however, it all ends up in a loud explosion and a thick cloud of smoke. But, everything about this latest craze is so infectious--so, without delay--everyone in the once-gloomy underworld starts doing the crazy dance. Who is the best dancer?
Pluto, having seen the earth, comes back home amazed at the success of that well-known dance, the "cake-walk." He has brought back with him two noted well-known dancers, who start their favorite dance amidst the flames. A queer and ugly being wishes also to join in the dance, but his limbs break away and dance far from him. All the subjects of His Majesty are seized with the irresistible mania for dancing, and start an unbridled provincial dance. At this sight Satan starts out of the earth a large blaze, which annihilates everything around him, disappearing himself through the flames. This view has beautiful new effects and much improves with colors. For the first time in a cinematograph view one can see some of the will-o'-the-wisp wandering among human beings. The effect is magical.
