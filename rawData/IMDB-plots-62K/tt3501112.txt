A security guard protects an eleven year-old girl who is being targeted by a gang for participating as a trial witness.
An ex-special services veteran (Antonio Banderas), down on his luck and desperate for work, takes a job as a security guard at a run-down mall in a rough area of town. On his first night on the job, he opens the doors up to a distraught and desperate young girl who has escaped and fled from a hijacking of the U.S. Marshal motorcade that was transporting her to testify as a trial witness. Hot on her heels is psychopathic hijacker (Sir Ben Kingsley), alongside his resourceful henchmen, who will stop at nothing to extract and eliminate their witness.
