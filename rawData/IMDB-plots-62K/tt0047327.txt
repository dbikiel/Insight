The relationships between a veteran marshal, his bride-to-be, a rookie and his fianc√©e are severely tested when the young carabiniere is temporarily sent to a distant town.
In a small Italian village, Maria De Ritis is engaged to army Lieutenant Pietro Stelluti. Stelluti's superior officer, Marshal Antonio Carotenuto, is contemplating marriage to Annarella Mirziano, but he will be forced to resign if he marries Annarella, since she has an illegitimate child and that is against regulations for army officers. When Stelluti leaves town for a few weeks, the town-gossips create an affair out of the innocent relationship between Maria and Antonio. Stelluti returns and accuses Maria of infidelity, and, she, in reprisal, runs off and joins a traveling theatrical troupe as a dancer. Antonio, after convincing Annarella that he has not betrayed her love, encounters more trouble when the father of Annarella's child shows up and asks that she and the child go away with him. Antonio tells Annarella that it is her decision to make, and she chooses the child's father and leaves with him. Maria arrives back in town, as does an earthquake that destroys her home, but she and Stelluti are reunited.
In this sequel we see Marshall Antonio Carotenuto forced to resign because he wants to marry Annarella. In fact in the 50s was considered scandalous for a Carabinieri Marshall to marry a single-mother. Policeman Stelluti, engaged to Maria AKA 'La Bersagliera', has to leave the village for job reasons. But when Maria goes to work as domestic under Antonio people start chatting making Annarella very jealous. But problems aren't still over, indeed in the village is arriving Annarella's seducer.
