Bella Thorne (Shake It Up!, Frenemies), Madison Pettis (Lab Rats, Beverly Hills Chihuahua 3) and Ryan Ochoa (Pair of Kings, The Perfect Game) lead an ensemble cast in this spook-tacular adventure with new ghosts, new thrills, and the return of some old friends. Max (Ochoa) only has eyes for Cammy (Thorne), the smart, popular redhead at school. When Max finally scores a date with Cammy on Halloween, Phears, an evil ghost with plans on taking over the world, unleashes his ghouls and things go haywire. With the help of his ghostly pals, Tara and Nicky, can Max thwart Phears' evil plot, help reunite his ghost friends with their long-lost parents and still make his date with Cammy on Halloween? R. L. Stine's Mostly Ghostly: Have You Met My Ghoulfriend? is a frightful family delight.
