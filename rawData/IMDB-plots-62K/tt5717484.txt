Jean-Paul Bolzec had gone to play his show for a French company based in Azerbaijan. On the way back to the airport, the taxi breaks down. Bolzec is abandoned on a desert road, in the middle of nowhere. Without realizing it, he crossed the border on foot with Armenia, in latent war with its neighbor Azerbaijan for years. Clandestine in a country he doesn't know, he doesn't speak the language and doesn't read the alphabet, Bolzec understands quickly enough that he is taken for another because he is celebrated as the Messiah.
