As the members of a group of suicide bombers in Syria wait for their turn to go on a final mission, this film lays bare the faith and doubt at the core of men who give their life for their cause.
An intimate portrait of a group of very different suicide bombers working for Al Qaeda in Syria. From the Saudi who loves singing and fried chicken, to a 26-year-old white British convert who worries a lot about his new wife, this remarkable film embeds with an unlikely bunch of "martyrdom seekers", each waiting for their turn to go on a final mission, known by Jihadis as 'Dugma'. In scenes of contemplative beauty and intimacy, this profound documentary lays bare the faith and doubt at the core of men who become suicide bombers.
