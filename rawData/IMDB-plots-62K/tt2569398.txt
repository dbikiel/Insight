31th of December. Moscow impossible traffic jams. Haste without results, help from which no one becomes easier. Conversations about the endless little things in which life passes - and maybe already passed. About the father, to whom nothing is left, and nothing can be done. About the plans of a thirteen-year-old girl to live: you can become an oncologist, you can - a food designer. About what was, and what now.
