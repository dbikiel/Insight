The crew of PT-73 are in trouble again when Ensign Parker is mistaken for a pilot and gets shanghied into the Air Force.
Tim Conway plays WW II PT-boat Navy Ensign Parker who must disguise himself to escape from a sticky situation -- unfortunately (one would think) for him, the uniform with which he absconded belongs to the son a 4-star general. Mistaken for the misplaced general's son, Parker constantly finds himself in situations for which his incompetence ill-prepares him, and yet he not only succeeds (incredibly) but does so while battling the nervous stresses added by the continual presence of Capt. Binghamton. Parker is almost immediately given a desk job (surrounded with, um, "physically blessed" WAC officers) and from there is assigned a navigator's position on a bomber. Although scared to fly and totally incompetent at navigation, he does somehow survive the flight. This follows a muffed turn in a flight trainer and grabbing a room in the WAC barracks (yes, hilarity ensued). Throughout, Ensign Parker is accompanied by nervous nellie Capt. Binghamton, who of course sees disaster around every corner of the plot and is usually the recipient of whatever embarrassment comes their way.
