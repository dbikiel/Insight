A teacher kidnaps the attorney who successfully defended her gay brother's killer.
Gwen (Annette O'Toole) grieves her murdered brother and hopes for justice in court, only to sit helplessly as her brother is defamed by a sleazy attorney (Michael McKean) and the murderer acquitted. Out of desperation she kidnaps the killer to deliver final justice.
Imagine the rage you'd feel if a loved one was murdered and then his character was assassinated in court. This is an emotion that Gwen, a woman whose brother is brutally murdered, is not only familiar with but acts on. After a sleazy attorney uses corrupt tactics to convince a jury to free her brother's killer, Gwen kidnaps him. What follows is an enlightening experience for everyone - especially Gwen, who learns that Merle, the attorney, is only interested in winning cases and has little faith in the intelligence of a jury.
