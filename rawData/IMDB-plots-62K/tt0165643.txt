A group of white high school teens become involved with Harlem's black hip-hop crowd.
Set in New York City, Black and White features several losely related stories centering on a pair of documentary filmmakers, Sam and her husband Terry, in following a group of caucasian teens, Raven, Charlie, Will, Marty, Wren and others who try to fit in with Harlem's black hip-hop crowd who include gangster rapper Rich Bower and his music partner Cigar in landing a recording gig, as well as college basketball player Dean who is conflicted on taking a fall on a game for shady gambler Mark Clear who has hidden agenda for Dean and Rich.
Hip-hop culture in New York City attracts White kids from privilege and young Black men moving from crime to the recording studio. For the White kids, it's a fad they throw themselves into: the girls into sex and at least one boy into violence. For the Black men, there's expression and, perhaps, fame. Looking on, besides a gambler turned cop, is a wealthy couple: she's making a documentary of White kids attracted to Black pop culture, he's cruising for men. The cop, who's motive is unclear, sets up a college athlete to throw a game then puts on the squeeze. A very blond grad student moves from Black man to Black man. A D.A. worries about his career and his son. It's a mix.
