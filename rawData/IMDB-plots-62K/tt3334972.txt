After 40 years, Harold's successful business selling furniture, is bankrupt when IKEA decides to open a new superstore right next door. In anger and despair, he decides to go to Sweden to kidnap the IKEA-founder himself, Ingvar Kamprad.
For over 40 years, Harold has been running a successful business, "Lunde Furniture" together with his wife, Marny. But this comes to an end when IKEA decides to open a new superstore right next door to Harold's small furniture shop. Harold and Marny lose both their shop and their home to the bank, and to make matter worse, Marny is starting to lose her memory. In mounting anger and desperation, Harold wants revenge. He arms himself with a pistol, gets into his old Saab, and sets off for Älmhult, Sweden, in order to kidnap his Nemesis - the founder of IKEA, Ingvar Kamprad. But unfortunately, Kamprad is quite happy to be kidnapped.
After forty long years--or nearly fifteen thousand days--the hard-working and self-made small furniture businessman, Harold Lunde, and his now ailing wife, Marny, see a lifetime's hard work go down the drain when an IKEA mega-store opens next to his humble Norwegian shop. Desperate, penniless, and out of business, Harold will have no other choice but to resort to a reckless and equally ambitious plan of action, involving IKEA's über-successful founder and loathsome arch-nemesis, Ingvar Kamprad. All Harold needs is a loaded handgun; however, does he have the guts to go all the way?
