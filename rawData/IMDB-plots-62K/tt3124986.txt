'Summer '82 - When Zappa Came to Sicily' is a 'homecoming story' of two families, Sicilian filmmaker Salvo Cuccia's and the family of Sicilian-American Rock icon Frank Zappa. Cuccia's story explores the unexpected intersection of the filmmaker, and the Zappa family, as they each try to reconnect with fathers who died young.
