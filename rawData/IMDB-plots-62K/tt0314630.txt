An introspective dentist's suspicions about his wife's infidelity stresses his mental well being and family life to the breaking point.
The movie centers on a dentist who has a strange dream that blurs the boundaries between fantasy and reality.
The American Dream of the dentist David Hurst is complete: he is married with his sweetheart from the dental school, the also dentist Dana that works with him and is an aspirant opera singer; he has three lovely daughters; he lives in a very comfortable house; and he has his own business. David is presently treating the troubled blunt musician Slater, having a complicated relationship with his client. When David glances his wife in the backstage of the theater before a presentation of Nabucco, he sees a man caressing her and he imagines she is having an affair. The repressed David becomes mentally ill and uses Slater as his alter-ego to express his anger while fantasizing the relationship of his wife and fighting to keep his marriage.
David and Dana Hurst share a dental practice in Westchester County, a marriage, and three young daughters. Noise seems a constant in the household, and the youngest doesn't want her dad out of sight. Dana's in the chorus of a community opera production of 'Nabucco,' and when David pops backstage before curtain to give her a good-luck charm, he sees her with another man, clearly infatuated, maybe in love. As David sorts out what to do, in imagined conversations with an unhappy patient, his grief leads to aberrant acts, and violence seems close at hand. A bout of the flu that runs through the family brings things to a head.
