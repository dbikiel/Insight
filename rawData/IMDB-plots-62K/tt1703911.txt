A young woman spends a night trapped inside a laundromat with a serial killer.
A beautiful young dancer, Rosa (Ana De Armas) comes home from an audition (which comprises the background for the opening credits), feeling quietly confident about getting a break. Just as she arrives, her very sketchy cellphone rings, to tell her she has a call-back the next day. Excited, she visits the nearby laundromat to wash her costume, where she is spooked by various members of her neighbourhood's nightly denizens.
