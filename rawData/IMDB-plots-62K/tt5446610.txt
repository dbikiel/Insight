After years away, Ariel (Alan Sabbagh) returns to Buenos Aires seeking to reconnect with his father Usher, who founded a charity foundation in Once, the city's bustling Jewish district where Ariel spent his youth. In the process of trying to meet his father and getting entangled in his charitable commitments, Ariel meets Eva (Julieta Zylberberg, Wild Tales). Eva's independent spirit motivates Ariel to come to grips with the traditions that once divided him and his father.
