From their shocking arrival in the WCW to their eventual resurgence in the WWE, the nWo were one of the most popular wrestling stables in history. This documentary gives an in-depth and behind-the-scenes look at the New World Order interviewing former members who helped change the face of wrestling forever.
One year after WCW went to compete against WWF on Monday nights, president Eric Bischoff acquired two former WWF superstars, Scott Hall and Kevin Nash. When life-long hero Hulk Hogan betrays WCW by aligning himself with the two new guys, a new stable was made: the New World Order. Fans thought they were sent by WWF to destroy WCW. Clad in black and white, and always receding new members, these anti-heroes soon became the hottest sports stars in the world and made WCW the top wrestling promotion. Undergoing many changes in members and a brief stint in WWF, this documentary takes a look at the team that forever changed the way sports entertainment is viewed.
