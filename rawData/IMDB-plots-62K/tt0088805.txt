A couple have a fight over a scrabble game unaware that a full scale nuclear war has started.
What would you do if humanity faced total annihilation in the shape of a full-scale nuclear attack? Would you still have time--or the appetite--for a dramatic game of Scrabble and a fiery domestic quarrel, or would you rather think back to when you were young, and everything was peachy? With this in mind, would your never-failing handsaw be of any use? In the end, would you still be able to boost your Scrabble score?
A couple plays Scrabble. He's stuck with seven E's and getting nowhere fast, so she decides to do some housework. While she's out of the room, he glances at her letters; she catches him at it and an argument ensues. Meanwhile, a nuclear war is breaking out, with chaos in the streets as people try to escape the city before bombs fall. The couple's argument escalates; they bring up their pet peeves - "you're always shaking your eyes," "well, you're always sawing the furniture!" Can there be reconciliation before annihilation? And, what about the Scrabble game?
