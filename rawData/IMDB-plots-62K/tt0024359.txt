Ruth Raymond works on the switchboard and her boyfriend is John Blake. It has taken 14 years, but a detective named Murray has found her and confirmed that she is Ruth Carson. As a child, she was kidnaped by her uncle and is the daughter of a wealthy railroad tycoon. Under the watchful eye of Godfrey D. Scott, an attempt on her life is foiled. But a fake telegram put her on a private railroad car heading east. It is in this car that her life is again in danger and people are murdered.
Ruth Raymond and Georgia Latham are friends and fellow switchboard operators at Allen &amp; Co. brokerage in Los Angeles. Ruth has been dating John Blake, who was recently fired from Allen &amp; Co. As such, their liaisons now have to be on the sly. Expecting that she will be next to be fired because of her association with John, Ruth is surprised that when she is called into her boss' office that New York attorney Alden Murray tells her that she is really the long lost daughter of railroad tycoon, Lou Carson, one of the richest men in the world. While Ruth's life will change for the better being an heiress and having a father for the first time in her life, it also has its downsides as John now believes he is not worthy of her not being rich. Her life will also be fraught with danger as she becomes the target of kidnappers. Murray's primary mission now is to get Ruth to her father in New York, unaware that the kidnappers have set in motion a plan. Alden accompanies Ruth and Georgia to New York in a special train car. Along for the ride is Godfrey D. Scott, a man who recently opened an office in the same building as Allen &amp; Co., he who is trying to advance two romances, Ruth and John's, and his own with Georgia, with who he has fallen in love. Scott sees his role as a deflector to steer any negative goings-on from Ruth. But the unknown plan by the kidnappers and other goings-on, such as encountering a circus wreck en route, make for a less than quiet and safe train ride.
