Jarle Klepp gets a message that forces his mind back to something he'd rather forgotten - his childhood with his father in Stavanger. When "Orheim" was his surname.
Company Orheim tells the story of teenager Jarle and his parents struggling to live under the same roof in Stavanger, Norway, during the mid 1980s. The members of the Orheim family all have their hopes and dreams, but find it hard to cope with everyday life. Jarle finds his escape through music, political activism and chasing girls, but standing up for himself at home is a battle still to be fought. A family drama and coming of age story about guilt and atonement, and the cost of independence.
