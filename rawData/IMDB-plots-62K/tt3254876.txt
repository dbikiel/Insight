Two Kazakh brothers are about to lose their ancestral tumbledown house to corruption and nepotism while their little sister loses her capacity to breathe and their mother loses her mind.
25 year-old John, his teenage brother Erbol, and their sickly 12 year-old sister Aliya, are forced to leave their house in the Kazakh city of Almaty. By luck their mother left them a house in a remote village, where they plan to prepare their comeback. But the District Officer's alcoholic brother, who has lived there illegally for 10 years, has no intention of letting the house go without a fight.
