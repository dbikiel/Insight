A genetically created Anaconda, cut in half, regenerates itself into two aggressive giant snakes, due to the Blood Orchid.
Picking up immediately where Anaconda 3 left off, herpetologist Amanda Hayes finally learns her employer Murdoch's true colors when he hires a doctor to harvest a fresh supply of blood orchids to experiment with the regenerative nectar on a baby snake in order to seek treatment for his own terminal illness. Amanda is forced to secretly bring together another team of scientists whom face off against a heavily armed squad of Murdoch's men to steal the coveted orchids before the killer Anaconda hunts both parties down.
