A Taiwanese high school baseball team travels to Japan in 1931 to compete in a national tournament.
Under Japanese rule, an underdog high school baseball team from southern Taiwan defeats the heretofore superior northern teams and wins a rare opportunity to represent the colony in the 1931 empire-wide tournament. Comprised of Taiwanese, Taiwanese aboriginals and Japanese players, "Kan√¥," the Kagi Nourin School team, must integrate the ethnically mixed roster and make the best of its unique strengths to not just survive but thrive in the elite league.
