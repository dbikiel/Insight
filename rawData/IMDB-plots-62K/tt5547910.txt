A man struggling to find purpose in life is enlightened by a drunk ailing widow.
Jobless and hopeless, Rodney (Steve Olson) hits rock bottom when he finds out his girlfriend Tess (Katrina Bowden) is cheating him. With nowhere to turn, Rodney drives aimlessly until his car quits on him, leaving him stranded in front of a stranger's house. The next morning he's awoken by June (Katherine Cortez), an ailing drunk widow who busts him for stealing her electricity. Instead of having Rodney arrested, June puts him to work around the house. June's increasing pity for Rodney eventually earns him a temporary spot in her home, which lasts longer than they both anticipated.
