Three friends are asked to be bridesmaids at a wedding of a woman they used to ridicule back in high school.
On the night of one of their old high school friend's wedding three irresponsible and capricious bridesmaids reunite for one last bachelorette bacchanal in the Big Apple. They unintentionally create a mess of their best friend Becky's wedding dress, before she marries her sweetheart Dale. They attempt to repair the situation by spending the evening before and morning of the wedding desperate to get the dress to Becky on time before the wedding starts, whilst discovering themselves and what they truly want from their lives along the way.
Becky summons her high-school slut friends Regan, Gena and Katie to be bridesmaids of her wedding with the handsome Dale. The trio spends one crazy night of drugs, booze, sex and confusions in New Yorkr trying to fix the wedding dress of Becky that they have torn.
Four high school friends, the B-Faces, reunite for Becky's marriage to her sweetheart, Dale, and for this reason, Regan, Gena, and Katie plan to throw a bachelorette party for the first in the gang who settles down. In other words, they are determined to party hard and have a blast, just like prom night for grown-ups. After six months of careful planning, the excited bridesmaids are now ready to set New York on fire; however, disaster strikes when the girls accidentally ruin Becky's wedding dress, triggering a series of desperate attempts to make things right while the clock is ticking. Now, as the B-Faces roam the streets of the bustling metropolis, only an epically brilliant plan can save the day. But, will they make it in time?
