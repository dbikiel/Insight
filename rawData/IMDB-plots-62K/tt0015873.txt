The struggles of a hardscrabble Iranian nomadic tribe as they journey through bleak country to reach the grasslands that will save their livestock.
The real-life struggles of the Bakhtiari tribe of Southern Persia (Iran) to migrate with 50,000 people and ten times as much livestock over seemingly impassable natural barriers of mountain and river during harsh weather conditions to reach grazing lands for their cattle and other livestock. Their hardscrabble life is portrayed with poetically beautiful cinematography in possibly the greatest documentary of the silent era.
This documentary follows the journey of the Bakhtiari, a poor nomadic tribe in Iran, as they herd their livestock up snow-covered mountain passes--barefoot--to get to the grazing lands on the other side of the mountains before their animals die from hunger.
