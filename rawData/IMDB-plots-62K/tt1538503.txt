This is a short film which is a prequel to Fast and Furious involving the fugitive ex-convict Dom assembling his crew in the Dominican Republic to plan a hijacking of a road train gasoline tanker truck.
This short story sets up the heist that is at the beginning of the fourth Fast and Furious film, the one where they hijack the fuel tanker road truck in the Dominican Republic. After hiding out in Mexico, fugitive and ex-convict hijacker Dom is working with his new partners, Tego and Leo, to plan a new hijacking. Dom calls upon the assistance of Han (from the spin-off film Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift). Next they have to break Leo out of prison so he can join their crew. There is a gasoline shortage in the Dominican Republic and they meet with a corrupt politician that is going to make it possible to obtain the gas the town needs. Letty arrives when she finds Dom surrounded by "skanks". Dom leaves with Letty of course. The next day, they take a romantic drive to a remote beach and re-kindle their romance prior to their next job.
