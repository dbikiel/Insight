Lillian is a 21-year-old drifter engaged to a philandering loser and locked in her room with a strange man. She lives next to a failed violinist who won't stop playing his instrument. He lives next to a New Age fanatic who's into colonic treatments; she lives next to two drug addicts who mess with the wrong prostitutes and end up answering to a pimp named Mr. Tangerine. In a barrage of head-spinning vignettes, we are sucked into a surreal motel fantasy-land where society's riffraff dwell in that awkward place between freedom and desperation.
