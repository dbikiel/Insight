Lady Mary Lasenby is a spoiled maiden who always gets her way until shipwrecked with her butler, then learns which qualities are really admirable in a person.
Lord Brockelhurst, his unwilling betrothed Lady Mary, his butler Crichton and scullery maid Tweeny are on Lord Loam's yacht which is wrecked leaving them all to cope on a desert island. Class distinctions fall apart for the time being.
"The picture is spoken of as a story that enters a family of English blue blood, reveals their luxuries, snobberies, whims and their selfish class distinction. It takes them on a cruise with their servants, wrecks them on the rocks, flings them, mistress and maid, lord and butler into the wilds of an untamed tropical island. What happens after has been woven into one of the most interesting stories that has ever been filmed." - Review section, Staff, "'Male and Female' Is Big Film Story," Riverside Daily Press, Riverside, California, Monday 22 December 1919, Volume XXXIV, Number 303, page 7.
