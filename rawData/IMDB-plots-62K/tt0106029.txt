Three-part mini-series set during three different eras in a single room of an odd hotel where employees never age. Every story has a slight twist to it, but the stories are mostly dialogue-heavy psychological or relationship dramas.
The lives of several people spanning from 1936 to 1993 are chronicled during their overnight stay at a New York City hotel room. The hotel room undergoes minor changes through the century, but the employees of the hotel remain unchanged, never aging.
Three episodes all set in Room 603 of a New York City hotel involving different guests, but with the same hotel staff spanning several decades. In "Tricks" set in 1969 meek middle-aged man Moe Boca brings prostitute Darlene to his room where their tryst is interrupted by the arrival of Moe, a creepy lusty old man whom Lou clearly knows well but refuses to call him a friend. Strange mind-game ensues that brings the sanity of both men to question. In "Getting Rid of Robby" set in 1993, posh and vain Sasha brings two of her girlfriends to help her get her lover and provider Robert, a Hollywood insider and playboy, to take their relationship seriously and offer her marriage. Things take a wrong turn when it turns out that she's the one who needs to face reality. In "Blackout" set in 1936, caring husband Danny brings some Chinese take-out food to the room for his disturbed wife Diane, when a sudden city-wide blackout occurs. The couple recently arrived to town so she could get some help with her mental issues. The darkness brings out the painful memories of their only child who drowned years before.
