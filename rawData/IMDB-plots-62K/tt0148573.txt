From the Irish countryside to London to New York City and back again, Maggie Sheridan (Dame Helen Mirren) reenters the world as a countess and shady art dealer. With her panache and charisma, she finds more than an auction, a rekindled interracial love affair, helpful relatives, and a painting of great price. She finds more than she bargained for in the labyrinth and milieu of stolen art.
