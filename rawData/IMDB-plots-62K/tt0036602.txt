Andy is going to Wainwright College as did his father. He sees a pretty blonde on the train and he is alternately winked at or slapped every time he sees her. Andy is clueless. On the train Andy meets Kay and Dr. Standish who are both headed for Wainwright. Andy likes Kay, but Dr. Standish also seems to take an interest in her. Things are going well at College with Kay, but the blonde is nice one minute and ignores Andy the next. When Andy finds out that the blonde are identical twins, he tries to help them out with their father but gets caught at their rooming house after midnight.
Now 18 years old, Andy Hardy heads off to Wainwright College, his father's alma mater. His problems start on the train when he realizes he doesn't have his ticket. Then there's the problem of the attractive blonde making eyes at him, only he doesn't know the girl has a twin. His real interest is in fellow student, coed Kay Wilson. She seems to have her eye on a much older man, Professor Standish. Andy seems to be quite good at putting his foot in his mouth and becomes convinced that Standish is out to get him. Just as he decides he's not good enough for college, Judge Hardy decides to pay the boy a visit and see how he's doing.
