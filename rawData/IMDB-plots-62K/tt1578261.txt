Childhood friends Abhay and Aaliya experience plenty of obstacles in their paths as they find their way in the world and back to each other.
Mumbai-based Aaliya Khan and Abhay Gulati have been close friends for over a decade but Aaliya is not prepared to take this relationship to a marriage. Instead, without any warning, she decides to re-locate to Australia, to live with her aunt. Upon arrival, she finds her aunt very stern and organized, and ends up moving out to live with Nadia and Cyrus. Concerned about her safety, Abhay travels there but gets a lukewarm reception. She takes to acting, while he drives a taxi and then starts selling home-made food. He eventually returns home and takes Aaliya totally by surprise when she finds out that he is getting married.
