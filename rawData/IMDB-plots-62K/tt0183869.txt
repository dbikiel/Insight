Police inspector Emilien and his taxi-driver pal Daniel are back, this time on the tail of a group of Japanese yakuza.
The Japanese ambassaor is visiting Marseilles to view the city police's anti-gang tactics. During the visit, however, he is kidnapped by a group working for the Japanese yakuza. Young officer Emilien is determined to rescue the ambassador and officer Petra (his girlfriend), who was also kidnapped, and restore the honor of his department. Once again, speed demon taxi-driver Daniel (from the first Taxi movie) is called upon to save the day with his high-speed driving skills.
