Stranded in an Arctic mine, two lone survivors are forced to fight for their lives, evading and hiding from a new kind of terror.
In a remote mining facility located somewhere in the Arctic circle, a monster kills 96 of the 98 people there. The 2 remaining survivors try to hide from it, but with food and water running low, they decide to escape to a safe zone as it contains an abundance of supplies. As soon as they leave, however, they are instantly pursued by the monster through large rooms and narrow corridors with only a couple of guns to defend themselves with.
