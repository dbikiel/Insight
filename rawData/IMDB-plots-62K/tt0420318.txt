A wealthy small-town wiseguy organizes the wedding party for his daughter. As the party begins, unexpected events start to occur and disturb the party for the hosts and guests alike.
Wojnar is a wealthy man who is marrying off his beautiful daughter Kaska, in a small town in present-day Poland. He had to bribe the groom with a fancy car, since Kaska had been pregnant with another man. At the end of the ceremony, the car is delivered by a gangster, who immediately demands the promised sum of money and the deed to land from Kaska's grandfather. Unfortunately, the grandpa is unwilling to let go of the land. Meanwhile each of the wedding reception workers demands to be paid, so Wojnar, who is very reluctant to part with his money, tries to haggle and bribe his way out of all the situations.
