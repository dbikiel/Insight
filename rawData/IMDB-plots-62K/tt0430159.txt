Why do dogs bark at such innocent creatures as pigeons and squirrels... what are they afraid of? This film answers that eternal question.
An exuberant dog that growls, barks, and shows his teeth at the slightest provocation convinces his owner to take him on a walk. The dog pulls on the leash as they head for the park. Once there, a series of animals (a bug, a bluebird, a mole, and others) as well as a flower attack the dog's owner while the dog is always late or ineffective in performing his guardian duties. Will all end well as the dog escorts his owner home?
