Surfers are being brutally murdered. Is the culprit a sea monster or just one of the teens' jealous parents?
A young girl is killed at the beach in Malibu. Professor Otto Lindsay suspects that it is some form of mutated fish. However, his son Richard, who was a good friend of the girl, thinks that it is a madman who has a grudge against Richard and his friends. Soon the list of victims grows to include one of Rich's surfing buddies, Rich's bitchy stepmother Vicky and his friend Mark who was crippled in an auto accident.
'40s movie hero Jon Hall ("The Hurricane") directs himself as Otto Lindsay, an oceanographer as a series of murders seems to have been committed by some sort of sea monster. The monster has a pointed head, bulging eyes, and seaweed hanging from it. Filmed in B&amp;W with color sequences (stock footage of people surfing). Music by Frank Sinatra, Jr. Also titled "The Beach Girls and the Monster."
