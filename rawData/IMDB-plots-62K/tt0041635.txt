After having spent all his money to fullfill the smallest wish of his wife Dora, Robert is still madly in love with her. Now, she is at agony, and her mother comes. She will reveal to Robert how he has been fooled. Through some flashbacks, we will see the story through Robert's or his mother-in-law's eyes. A very misogynous movie...
