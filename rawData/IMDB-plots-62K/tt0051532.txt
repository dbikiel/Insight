Sent to destroy a Nazi petrol dump in the North African desert, a British commando team unexpectedly discovers a large Nazi tank unit, and must inform headquarters in time.
A small British Army team is sent to destroy a German petrol dump as part of the preparation for a major attack in the North African campaign. While they are there, they spot a large number of tanks and realize that Army intelligence must be informed or some Tommies are going to be in for a nasty surprise. The Germans are equally determined that they should not reach their base, and a tense chase across the desert is the result.
