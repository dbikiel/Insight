Camp that encourages children who lost close family members to open up about their feelings.
One Last Hug: Three Days at Grief Camp chronicles a three day summer camp for children learning to cope with the death of a loved one. With the guidance of trained professionals, grieving children as young as seven years old learn that their feelings are normal, and that by talking about them they can begin to heal. A testament to the healing power of shared sorrow, One Last Hug shows the often-unseen and particular experience of children's grief.
Children who have lost close family members open up in this poignant film about a unique three-day retreat that helps them to move forward in the grieving process. Founded by baseball great Jamie Moyer, Camp Erin is a weekend-long camp for children who have lost loved ones. Through group meetings, walks in the woods, and even a scavenger hunt, campers are encouraged to reveal their feelings and process their emotions through interaction with other grieving children.
