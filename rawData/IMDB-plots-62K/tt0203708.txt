"A battalion of New York's famous mounted police at inspection. They approach at break-neck gallop." - from the Edison Catalog
In Central Park, a large group of New York City mounted police officers are in full dress uniform. Starting from a distance, they begin to charge in unison directly towards the camera, passing a carriage moving in the opposite direction as they do so.
