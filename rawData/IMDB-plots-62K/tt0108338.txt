The existential protagonist is a hungry, homeless, socially isolated, and socially alienated young man living on the streets of an anonymous Russian big city in the 19th Century. He's looking for answers about himself and the things that he sees around him, but he's coming up short. Very innovative cinematography that alternates between B&amp;W and full color through the course of the film in a way that accents the dramatic action. Sometimes, a B&amp;W scene will even become full color in just one spot on the screen, a unique alternative to a close up shot.
