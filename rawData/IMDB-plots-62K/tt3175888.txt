Two family clans (here just called A and B) who had a long history of hostility agreed to bury their hostility. One central point of the agreement is that the youngest girl of A (who has not really a trustworthy young male escape. After some time they feel (correctly) that their present hiding place is not safe enough, and they make a second reached puberty) will marry the oldest man of B. The girl, her mother and escape. Here they are safe and this place is never found out. But in a town there will be a large festival. In view of the many years mother and daughter had lived without fear they take the chance and go to this town. But the B clan had expected that.
The story revolves around a daughter (Zainab) and the mother (Allah Rakhi). Two tribes agree upon putting an end to their disputes if the 14 year old Zainab of one tribe is married to the leader of other tribe who is an old man. Allah Rakhi flees from her home with her daughter and the deadly hunt for both of them begins. A truck driver helps them both reach Lahore where Allah Rakhi's mother lives.
