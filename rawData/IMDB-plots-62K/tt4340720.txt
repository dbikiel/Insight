After finding his brother murdered after returning from duty, Webster searches for the perpetrators, but discovers a conspiracy that cuts deep inside the U.S. government.
Special Operative James Webster (Michael Jai White "Blood and Bone", "The Dark Knight") just returned home from duty, only to witness the brutal slaying of his brother. Webster immediately tries to retaliate and hunt down the perpetrators, but as he delves deeper into the secret world of corruption and murder, he finds himself at the center of a deadly conspiracy that cuts deep inside the walls of the US Government. With the most ruthless military assassin (Steve Austin "The Expendables", "WWF Raw") hot on his trail, Webster must expose the corrupt high-ranking officials before he becomes just another victim of the nefarious plot.
