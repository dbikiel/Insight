A former high school teacher turned unionist tries to organize workers laboring with inhuman conditions at a late 19th Century textile factory.
The story of exploited textile factory workers in Turin, Italy at the turn of the century and their beginnings of their fight for better working conditions. Professor Sinigaglia (Marcello Mastroianni) is sent by (presumably) the Socialists to help them organize their strike and give form to their struggle.
At the end of the 19th Century, working conditions are intolerable for the sweat shop workers in a Piedmonte textile factory, The impoverished employees labor fourteen hours a day with a very short lunch, meager pay, no insurance, and horribly unsafe conditions. When an older worker loses a hand in an accident with a machine without receiving compensation from management, a former high school teacher turned labor organizer is dispatched to Turin to direct a strike.
