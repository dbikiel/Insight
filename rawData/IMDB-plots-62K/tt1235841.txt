Martín and Mariana are slightly damaged people who live in buildings just opposite one another. While they often don't notice each other, separation might be the very thing that brings them together.
Against the backdrop of modern urban alienation in bustling Buenos Aires, two perfect strangers who live across the street in their shoebox apartments--the agoraphobic web designer, Martín, and the disenchanted architect, Mariana--find themselves trapped in a sea of nearly three million inhabitants. To make matters worse, even though they live on the same street, swim in the same pool, and walk side by side, those two sensitive long-time loners have never met. But, somehow, the high and impenetrable wall that keeps them apart, may be the very thing that can bring them together. Will Mariana and Martín ever find out that they are, indeed, kindred spirits?
