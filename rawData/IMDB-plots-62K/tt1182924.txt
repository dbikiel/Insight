An unlikely friendship develops between a hitman and a suicidal guy who have both checked into the same hotel for different reasons.
An aging mobster is being transported from prison to the courthouse in Nice where he may name names. Milan, a hit man, checks into a hotel with a view of the courthouse; he sets up with a high-powered rifle to wait. Fran√ßois, a self-pitying photographer whose wife has left him, checks into the room next to Milan, intent on suicide. His bumbling, his constant chatter, and his calls to his ex and her husband threaten to keep Milan from success.
