Only one sweet and shiny little acorn separates Scrat, the tireless prehistoric sabre-toothed squirrel, from the perfect stash of provisions. However, when enough is enough?
Scrat is putting one last acorn into a huge and very neatly arranged stash, but it keeps popping up. He jumps on it -- once too often, and the whole stockpile falls through a knothole in the tree stump. The acorns and Scrat fall a very long way; on the way down, Scrat collects them into a huge ball. Everything hits the ground, and Scrat must pull out of the snow quickly to avoid one last acorn, which is becoming red-hot from the reentry force. It hits the Earth, with a major impact. But at least Scrat has that acorn - or does he?
Only one sweet and shiny little acorn separates Scrat, the tireless prehistoric sabre-toothed squirrel, from the perfect stash of provisions. Atop an ancient hollow tree brimming with the precious nuts, a teeny tiny spot is reserved for the last piece of the puzzle; however, greed always gets in the way. When enough is enough?
