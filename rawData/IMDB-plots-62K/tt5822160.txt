Lasse is an old racist who has lives in an apartment block filled with a selection of refugees and immigrants. Kamal is a 16-year old boy who's fed up in his life in Finland, and dreams of moving to Nairobi to live with his father. Only problem is that he doesn't have the money to buy the ticket.
Veikko is an old and grumpy man who lives in the same block of flats as Kamal who is a 17-year old teenager whose parents were immigrants, and he wants to move back to his father in Nairobi. Veikko wants to go to his summer cottage and as he thinks that Kamal has a driver's licence he asks him for a ride and promises to pay him well. Now Kamal has the money for his trip and a passport but he still has to take Veikko to his cottage. In the beginning of their ride they both are suspicious of each other but they get to know each other during the trip and notice that they are not so different. Kamal ends up solving why Veikko and his son are so different from each other and begins to think about his own family and should he leave Finland.
