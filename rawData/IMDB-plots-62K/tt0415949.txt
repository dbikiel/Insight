A 13-year-old boy uses his upcoming bar mitzvah to reconcile the strained relationship between his father and grandfather.
In toney Brentwood, Benjamin Fiedler prepares for his bar mitzvah; trouble is, he understands neither its meaning nor the Hebrew, and his parents (particularly his successful-agent father) are planning the most lavish party possible. Benjamin wants his dad to give him some space, so he gets an idea: to invite his grandfather, who left the family years ago and for whom Benjamin's dad has an intense dislike, to come two weeks early. Thanks in part to grandpa - and to the immediate family's love - Benjamin may have a shot at figuring out what it means to be a man.
After slick Zachary Stein's lavish bar mitzvah (a Titanic themed event) was a spectacular hit, even by Brentwood socialite standards. His dad Ari's rival as Hollywood agent, Adam Fiedler, is determined that his boy Benjamin's bar mitzvah must outclass it. Ben is insecure and hopes to divert dad's attention by sneakily inviting his hedonistic paternal granddad, Irwin. Irwin abandoned still bitter Ari and his mother, granny Rose, but she welcomes Irwin back. Soon the Irwins bond with Ben and rather paternally prepares him for the rite of passage, ultimately inspiring a different approach as well as a more confident attitude.
