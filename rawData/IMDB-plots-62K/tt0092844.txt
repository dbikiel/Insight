An American journalist is set up and fed false information after the Lebanon war.
Don Stevens is an ace reporter sent to Beirut, Lebanon to report on the Lebanese civil war. There he befriends English journalist Mike Jessop, who's staying at the same hotel as him. Stevens' downfall begins when he manages to get an exclusive interview with the head of one of the main factions in the war, the Palestine Liberation Organization headed by Yassin Abu-Riadd. When he sends the taped interview in, he learns that the man he spoke with was in fact not Abu-Riadd but an impersonator. In an attempt to salvage his reputation and save his career, Stevens goes back to find out who set him up and why. However, all three sides in the war try to stop his investigation and his life comes into danger. Stevens comes to realize that he's a pawn in a huge deadly conspiracy and if he fails to uncover it, many innocent people will die. He finally gets a breakthrough, when he meets Linda Larsen, a Scandinavian doctor who might be able to take him to the real Abu-Riadd.
