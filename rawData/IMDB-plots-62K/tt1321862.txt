Three kids who travel back in time to 65 million years ago, where they are taken in by a dinosaur.
Three curious kids accidentally trip an egg-shaped time machine into operation and find themselves back 65 million years in the middle of a nest of dinosaur eggs. The first thing they see is a giant T-Rex staring down at them in happy wonder. They're not food, they're family! Now the kids have just until the real eggs hatch to find their way back to the present, facing other prehistoric monsters and dangers along the way.
The story of a daredevil kid named Ernie, his little sister Julia, and his best friend Max, who, while horsing around in Max's inventor father's workshop, accidentally trip a time-machine into operation and find themselves transported back in time 65 million years, where they're adopted by doting dinosaur mom Tyra (Melanie Griffith) and a rambunctious dinosaur "brother" named Dodger (Rob Schneider). The three kids explore the excitement of the prehistoric world - trying to steer clear of Tyra's evil dinosaur rivals (William Baldwin and Stephen Baldwin) - while, back in the present day, Max's dad and Ernie and Julia's overprotective mom (Jane Lynch) plot their rescue.
