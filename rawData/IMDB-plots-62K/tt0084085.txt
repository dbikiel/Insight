A young man discovers his homosexuality and begins a relationship with a manipulative huster/petty criminal that he meets at a train station.
It's summer, the end of adolescence for Henri who does not go on vacation. Accompanying his sister to the station, he meets a man who immediately attracts him. He then discovers another world, nocturnal, masculine, crossed by frustrated desires and sexual violence. Henri becomes the shadow of John, burning with his contact but looking for pleasure and, perhaps, love.
