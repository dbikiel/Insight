The Passionate Friends were in love when young, but separated, and she married an older man. Then Mary Justin (Ann Todd) meets Steven Stratton (Trevor Howard) again and they have one last fling together in the Alps.
In postwar London, Mary Justin (Ann Todd) runs into university lecturer Professor Steve Stratton (Trevor Howard), the true love of her life from when they were young. She is now married to a Treasury financier having opted for a safe, secure and affectionate relationship, but the meeting rekindles the past for a while. Mary and Steve part again, but a further brief encounter on vacation in Switzerland brings matters to a head.
