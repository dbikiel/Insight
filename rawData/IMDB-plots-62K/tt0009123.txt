Roscoe's wife wants him committed to the No Hope Sanitarium for a cure from drink. He is greeted by blood spattered, cleaver-wielding Buster and a barely clad female patient. He eats a thermometer and must be rushed into surgery.
An inebriated man stands in front of a drug store during a rain storm trying to light a cigarette. Back at his home, his wife and butler see a report on the No Hope Clinic's success curing alcoholics. When hubby arrives home, bringing two gypsies and their monkey, his wife insists it's time for the clinic. Once there, he gets a look at various surgeries, and he wants out - assisted at first by a woman who believes she's a mermaid. He pretends to drown, he dresses as a woman, and, when running away, he inadvertently joins the town's annual fat man foot race. But can he outrun the men in white coats?
In his cups, as was too often the case, an intoxicated Fatty returns home in the middle of a raging tempest, accompanied by his newest friends: a Gitano couple of panhandlers and their monkey. As a result, Roscoe's infuriated wife decides it's high time her husband paid a visit at the No Hope Sanitarium to cure his dependence; however, after a quick look, the clinic's latest inmate wants out. Will Fatty's ordeal ever end?
