An examination of the history and nature of erotic content in sequential art.
A sexy, revealing journey into the heart of erotic comic strips, SEX IN THE COMIX examines the colorful history of a unique and risqué art form. Through special editions by masters of the genre and provocative new works from a young generation of artists, the erotic comic is making a big-time comeback, both serving as an expression of society's most intimate trials and tribulations and exposing our collective fantasies (all via speech bubbles). Featuring legendary, iconoclastic comic creators R. Crumb, Milo Manara and Ralf König, and new wave artists like Aurelia Aurita, Aude Picault and Zep, this colorful and charming documentary takes fans along on a special exploration -- guided by New York comic artist and part-time burlesque performer Molly Crabapple -- into a one-of-a-kind medium.
