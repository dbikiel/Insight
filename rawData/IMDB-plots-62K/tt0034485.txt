Tommy Williams desperately wants to get to Broadway, but as he is only singing in a spaghetti house for tips he is a long way off. He meets Penny Morris, herself no mean singer, and through her gets the idea to promote a show to send orphaned children on a country holiday. But he is only using the kids to get on himself, which Penny soon realises. With his romance off, an engagement in Philadelphia he can't get to, and, indeed, war in Europe, life can be difficult.
After four months of floundering attempts to get into a Broadway show, Tommy Williams grasps the opportunity to produce a charity show to take city orphans on a trip to the country. With his new girlfriend, Penny, he and his young friends produce a musical. But Tommy lets potential success go to his head, ready to pitch his friends and his ideals.
