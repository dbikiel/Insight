Kirsten Dunst, playing herself, meets some unusual fans
The movie shows Kirsten Dunst from behind. She is talking on her cell and walking down her driveway to the gate. She stands by the road with her hair braided and is wearing a black top with jean shorts. As she picks the lint off of her clothes, she watches the activity on the road. A lady walks by with a beautiful, white, poodle. Then a golden Rolls Royce passes by with an older man driving it. Then she starts texting again, and pays no mind to a small car with two girls that whizzes past. Then, all of a sudden the car races back in reverse and stops. The two girls (Lauren Robertson, Maria Blasucci) get out and run up to the star to ask if she will allow her to let them take selfies (the original name of the short) with Kirsten in it. Kirsten is smiling and all too happy to accommodate them. However, she is disappointed when, instead of wanting to talk the two hip young ladies start using their smart phones to add to photos to their social networks for bragging rights. Her smile fades to a priceless look as the two girls explain their motives for stopping.
