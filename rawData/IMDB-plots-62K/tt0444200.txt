My name is Georges Figon. Okay I'm dead but, being the talkative kind, death isn't going to stop me from speaking. Yes, I'm a shady individual. Sure I have links with the underworld and other dark forces. But luring Ben Barka, the Moroccan opposition leader, into a trap was mainly an opportunity for me to become a great movie producer. Nothing political about it. Just the big money. And my girlfriend, actress Anne-Marie Coffinet, will become a star thanks to me. I have already been able to sign Georges Franju as the director,Marguerite Duras as the scriptwriter and Ben Barka as the technical advisor of a film that will never be. What I didn't know is that I had hired the Grim Reaper as the Nemesis...
