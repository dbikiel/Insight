The death of one of their own reunites a group of lifelong friends who have gone their separate ways. Back together for the first time since high school, they hash out their pasts and confront what pulled them apart.
Lifelong friends stumble back home after high school when word goes out on Facebook that the most popular among them has died. Old girlfriends, boyfriends, new lovers, parents, your first dead friend - how do people deal? The reunion stirs up sticky feelings of love, longing and regret, and the novelty of forgiveness, mortality and gratitude.
