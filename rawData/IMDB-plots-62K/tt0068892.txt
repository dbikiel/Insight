William Dorn decides to get back at all the people he blames for the overdose death of his daughter and the break up of his marriage, so he decides to go on a bombing spree. His first target is his daughter's old high school, which he all but destroys. His next target is the mental hospital where his daughter was when she died and his final target is the feminist organization his ex-wife was a member of. However, during his attack on the hospital there are two people who witness this action, a creepy rapist named George Fromley and his victim, a young mute girl. When police detective Geronimo Minelli is assigned to the case he must find Fromley not only to keep him from striking again, but to keep him alive before the Dorn makes him his next victim.
