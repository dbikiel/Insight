A suicidal young woman gives her newborn child up to his deadbeat father in the Fontainhas slums of Lisbon.
The first film in Pedro Costa's transformative trilogy about Fontainhas, an impoverished quarter of Lisbon, Ossos is a tale of young lives torn apart by desperation. After a suicidal teenage girl gives birth, she misguidedly entrusts her baby's safety to the troubled, deadbeat father, whose violent actions take the viewer on a tour of the foreboding, crumbling shantytown in which they live. With its reserved, shadowy cinematography by Emmanuel Machuel (who collaborated with Bresson on L'argent), Ossos is a haunting look at a devastated community.
Estrela d'Africa, a Creole neighborhood bordering Lisbon. A small child, a few days old, will survive several deaths. Tina, his young mother, takes him in his arms and opens the gas. Saved by his father, he sleeps in the street and drinks the milk of charity. Twice, he will be almost sold, by too much despair, too much love, for nothing. But Tina does not forget and her neighborhood sisters will want to avenge her.
