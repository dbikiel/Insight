A lonely woman recalls her first love thirteen years prior during a brief summer vacation.
While waiting for the night rehearsal of the ballet Swan Lake, the lonely twenty-eight year-old ballerina Marie receives a diary through the mail. She travels by ferry to an island nearby Stockholm, where she recalls her first love Henrik. Thirteen years ago, while traveling to spend her summer vacation with her aunt Elisabeth and her uncle Erland, Marie meets Henrik in the ferry and sooner they fall in love for each other. They spend summer vacation together when a tragedy separates them and Marie builds a wall affecting her sentimental life.
Marie is a talented young ballerina. She meets Henrik, a wealthy college-boy one summer while staying at her uncles. They fall in love and spend their days focused recklessly on each other. As Autumn draws near an uneasy feeling creeps over Marie and turns her stomach sour. The morning of one of their last few days together Henrik makes a shallow dive suffering head and back injuries that kill him not long after. Years later, Marie, bordering on edge of her career as a professional dancer, realizes the mistakes she has made in life as a result of Henriks traumatic death.
