A lone cop struggles to protect a female photographer from a gang of psychopathic bikers.
Early in "Black Cobra," Detective Robert Malone establishes himself as a maverick, uncompromising policeman when he guns down several criminals during a hostage standoff. Next, he finds himself protecting a female photographer who has witnessed a murder. She is sought by a moronic gang of motorcyclists who have been murdering and raping at will. Malone finds them, confronts them, and takes care of (police) business.
