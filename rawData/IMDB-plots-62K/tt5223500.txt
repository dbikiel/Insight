Matt Besser is here to air some grievances and break some comedy records, just don't bring up weed and he'll stay on track. With a new set of commandments, a collection of letters to the editor and his nemesis Ivan Krushnev Jr. making an appearance, this special is like no other! Filmed live at the UCB theater in Hollywood.
