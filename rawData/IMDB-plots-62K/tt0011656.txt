Two inventive farmhands compete for the hand of the same girl.
Farmhands Keaton and Roberts share a cottage full of mechanical devices for making life easy. They are rivals for the farmer's daughter. Keaton , disguised as a scarecrow, causes troubles for his rival and the farmer. When Keaton stoops to tie his shoe, the girl accepts what she thinks is his kneeling proposal.
Sharing a humble farm cottage rigged with all sorts of wonderfully strange and clunky gadgetry, the toothache-stricken farmhand, Buster, and his room-mate, Big Joe, find themselves competing for the heart of the same woman; the farmer's beautiful only daughter, Sybil. However, under those circumstances, can a misunderstood canine; a large threshing machine; a necessary impersonation, and a well-timed bow pave the way for a high-speed marriage ceremony and a happily married life?
