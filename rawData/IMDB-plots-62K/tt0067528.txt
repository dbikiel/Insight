Stan gets a little annoyed when his Mum and Sister keep buying expensive items on hire purchase, but the money he earns for overtime working as a bus driver means that he can afford it... just! His job is secure, as bus drivers are hard to come by, and his overtime prospects are good, until the bus company decide to revoke a long standing rule and employ women bus drivers. Aghast at the thought of no overtime and, therefore, less wages, he joins forces with his long time work colleague Jack to sabotage the new female employees.
This is the first in the trilogy of movies based on the British sitcom from the 60's and 70's. In this one Stan, needing the overtime pay because of the number of hire purchase items at his home tries, with the help of Jack, to oust the new women bus drivers who have been brought in because of staffing problems.
