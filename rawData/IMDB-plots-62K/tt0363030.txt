In the summer of 2002, blink-182 invited the little-known band Kut U Up to accompany them on The Pop Disaster Tour. Kut U Up is not known primarily for their music. They are however, worshipped for their innate ability to cause havoc, concern authorities, and leave destruction and laughter in their wake. Along with their instruments and several gallons of booze, Kut U Up packed a few cameras in their new van which resulted in: RIDING IN VANS WITH BOYS: THE DOCUMENTARY. RIDING IN VANS WITH BOYS is unfettered, s*#$-faced, start-to-finish hilarity mixed with real-life drama. This film is an uncensored look at four friends as they live their rock star dreams and trash everything in their path. Unbreakable bonds of friendship are formed and lifetimes of emotions are lived in two months. This documentary is a must-see for anyone who has ever been to a rock show and wondered, "what really goes on backstage?" RIDING IN VANS WITH BOYS also features great music -- live performances from: blink-182, Green Day, Jimmy Eat World, and Kut U Up! From the people that brought you blink-182's "The Urethra Chronicles 2 Harder, Faster. Faster, Harder.," RIDING IN VANS WITH BOYS is a film that will make you laugh, cry, vomit, go to an AA meeting, swear off drugs and pray that the four members of Kut U Up never end up at your house
