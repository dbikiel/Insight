Ash must stop a hunter who forces the mythical Pokémon Celebi to help him destroy a forest.
This movie centers around the new pokémon Celebi, a one-of-a-kind veggie-like bug whose only kin are celebi from other points in time. The movie begins in the past where a young boy named Sam attempts to save Celebi from a hunter. In a reciprocal effort, Celebi uses his power and transports itself and Sam to the present, Ash Ketchum's time. Sam and Ash become good friends as they fight to save Celebi from the new Team Rocket villain, the Iron-Masked Marauder and his darkball, which turns pokémon evil and augments their powers to the maximum. Yet, one rare pokémon isn't safe without help from another - thus enters Suicune, a.k.a. the North Wind.
