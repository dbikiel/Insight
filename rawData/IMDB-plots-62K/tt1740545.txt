A skeleton dances joyously, often collapsing into a heap of bones and quickly putting itself back together.
Can the macabre and the grotesque be humorous? Before our very eyes, Auguste Lumière and Louis Lumière's creepy and bleached skeleton transforms into a merry and loose-jointed artist, bent on dazzling us with his pleasing dancing figures. However, this ambitious performer still needs to hone his skills, as those slender but clumsy skeletal limbs keep detaching from the torso over and over again. Will the merry skeleton ever reach perfection?
