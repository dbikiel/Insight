The Old Testament story of Abraham and the trials he endures. Commanded by God to lead his family to the promised land of Canaan with the promise that if he does so, his descendants will become a great and numerous tribe. His obedience, as well as that of his children and grandchildren, is severely tested as they prove their faith to God.
The first chapter in the story of Salvation. Rather than choosing a great leader or king, God chooses Abraham, an elderly shepherd from Mesopotamia, as the way to establish his Covenant with mankind ... Abraham is a man of great faith. After his calling he continues to believe in God even when He seems to have abandoned him. For Abraham, God's greatest promise is that his family will continue through the line of Isaac, Abraham's favourite son. However God presents him with a tremendous test by asking him to sacrifice of Isaac. Is Abraham willing to put God first? Even before the life of his son?
