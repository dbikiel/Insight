Park ranger Donald sends his bears off to hibernate, but Humphrey would rather stay in his hammock, run out for a glass of water, etc., than sleep; when he does get to sleep, his snoring gets him thrown out. His search for a new bed leads him right into the ranger's house.
Park ranger Donald is pleased the tourist season is over, now he can send those bears he hate out of his sight to hibernate, but Humphrey not only needs a good kick in the backside to get him out of a hammock and into the cave, his shenanigans and snoring inside lead to his eviction by his better-behaved bear brethren. Being too weak and yellow to chase even a rabbit, he can find no natural dwelling, so he tries his luck at the ranger's station, but can't hide his huge self and Donald proves his worth at bear-chasing with a spiked bat to batter Humprey's butt trough the cat-trap. Finally a very human attribute inspires his roguish return to the bear cave...
