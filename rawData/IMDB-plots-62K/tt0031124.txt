A bank-robbery in London prevents - again - the marriage of Bulldog Drummond with his girlfriend. But this time when the delinquents are caught it will be celebrated at last.
Henri Armides and his assistant, Garvey, blow up and rob a London bank in broad daylight and get away with 10,000 pounds. They hide the money in a radio but the radio is in the apartment that Colonel Hugh "Bulldog" Drummond and his intended bride, Phyllis Caverling, will be occupying after they are married. Married nor not, they check out the honeymoon apartment. This does not bode well for Armides and Garvey's plans to recover the money; it also does not bode well for Phyllis and Drummond's plans to get married.
