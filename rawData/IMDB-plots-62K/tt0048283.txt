A captured architect designs an ingenious plan to ensure the impregnability of tomb of a self-absorbed Pharaoh, obsessed with the security of his next life.
In ancient Egypt, the Pharaoh Khufu (Jack Hawkins) is obsessed with acquiring gold and plans to take it all with him into the "second life". To this end, he enlists the aid of Vashtar (James Robertson Justice), an architect whose people are enslaved in Egypt. The deal: build a robbery-proof tomb and the enslaved people will be freed. During the years that the pyramid is being built, Cyprian Princess Nellifer (Dame Joan Collins) becomes the Pharaoh's second wife, and she plots to prevent Khufu from taking his treasure with him when he dies, as well as helping him make the journey early.
Pharaoh Khufu (Jack Hawkins) has amassed a fortune in gold and jewels through many years of war. His intention is to have all of his wealth buried with him, but worries about grave robbers. He commissions a recently acquired slave, Vashtar (James Robertson Justice), who is also a master architect, to design and build an impregnable burial vault within his pyramid. Meanwhile, an attractive young woman from Cyprus, Princess Nellifer (Dame Joan Collins), is sent to Khufu as tribute. She soon becomes his favorite and his second wife. When she sees his treasure, she has every intention of obtaining part of it for herself.
Khufu, a ruthless, rich and paranoid pharaoh, has decided to build the ultimate tomb to defy grave robbers and the ages. He uses a captive engineer to design the tomb in exchange for the release of the engineer's people. When money runs out to finish the tomb, a ruthless woman sent as tribute becomes Khufu's second wife, and after murdering Khufu's queen, attempts to assasinate the pharaoh and take over the kingdom, but is finally given her just desserts in the end.
