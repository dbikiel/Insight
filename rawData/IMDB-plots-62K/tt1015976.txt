A thief tries to fix the damage done during the biggest heist of his career.
John Cologne (Val Kilmer) has just pulled off the biggest heist of his life and is racing to get rid of the merchandise before he leaves for Florida to retire. The plans get mixed up when he meets a young boy in a downtown park who helps him to realize the important things he needs to change in his life. Before he can do that, he must unload the mysterious briefcase to the same gangster he stole it from without getting killed. The quick-witted John comes up with a plan and enlists the help of his friend Max (Wilmer Valderrama) to safely unload the merchandise. He's in a race against the clock to stay alive and make all the money he'd ever need for the rest of his life all in one afternoon. If he succeeds he can finally rekindle his relationship with his ex-wife (Marg Helgenberger) and become the father he's always wanted to be.
