In Gaza, two hairdressers and ten customers of various ages and backgrounds spend the day trapped in a beauty salon while Hamas police fight a gang in the street.
A hot summer's day in the Gaza Strip. Today the electricity is on. Christine's beauty salon is heaving with female clients: a bride-to-be, a pregnant woman, a bitter divorc√©e, a devout woman and a pill-popping addict. But their day of leisure is disrupted when gunfire breaks out across the street. A gangland family has stolen the lioness from Gaza's only zoo, and Hamas has decided it's time to settle old scores. Stuck in the salon, with the prospect of death drawing ever nearer, the women start to unravel. How will the day end? Will they lose their lives for the sake of "liberating the lioness"?
A mafia family stole the lion from the Gaza zoo and the Hamas decides to sort out their case. Trapped in the armed conflict, thirteen women are stuck in Christine's small hair dresser.
