A homeless man is hired as a survival guide for a group of wealthy businessmen on a hunting trip in the mountains, unaware that they are killers who hunt humans for sport, and that he is their new prey.
Mason, who lives on the streets, wants to cease his life when on the same day his two best friends die: His dog and an older man with whom he shared his food and roof. Just in time Cole, from a charity organization, can prevent his suicide and also offers him a quite well paid job as servant for a hunting party in the Rocky Mountains. Mason accepts the job and flies with them to a hut in the wilderness where they prepare everything for the four rich businessmen who want to hunt something special. Mason does not yet know that he is the victim of their sports that should lead to the basic insticts of man, but they did not count with his cleverness...
Ice-T, living a sweet, hobo lifestyle, is approached by some rich white dudes and offered a job "assisting" a bunch of other rich white dudes on a "hunting trip" in the Rockies. Failing to consider past relationships between poor black people and rich white people, he accepts their offer, only to find that by "assisting" the white dudes really meant "running for his life", and by "hunting trip" they really meant "hunting trip". It's a laugh-a-minute as we watch Ice-T use all of his street wiles and urban cunning to escape a gang of armed and gouty job-creators while running through the jungle.
