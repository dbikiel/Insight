A sleazy, desperate fur trader who haunts a local strip club, gets his hands on some priceless raccoon furs that might be more than just priceless but cursed.
Sleazy fur trader Jake Feldman will do anything for quality skin. When Jake crosses paths with fur trapper Jameson offering raccoon pelts caught at the sight of an ancient burial place, Jake jumps at the chance to cash in by stealing them in order to win the heart of a stripper named Shanna. But little does Jake know is that the raccoon pelts are cursed and will bring bloody revenge against anyone who touches them.
Pelts is an erotic tale about stolen raccoon pelts that violently turn against those that covet them in this Giallo-style adaptation of F. Paul Wilson's short story.
