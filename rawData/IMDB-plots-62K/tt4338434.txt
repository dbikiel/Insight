Miserable real estate agent Frank, whose business is failing and his relationship with his family is at an all-time low, meets by chance Sarah, a nice woman who reminds him of his mother. Their friendship starts healing him emotionally.
Real estate agent Frank Mollard (Anthony LaPaglia) won't admit it, but he can't move on. Divorced but still attached, he can't sell a house in a property boom and much less connect with his teenage son. One night Frank gets a phone call from his mother. Nothing out of the ordinary apart from the fact that she died a year ago!
