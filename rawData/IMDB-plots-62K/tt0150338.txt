The life and times of Baltimore film maker and midnight movie pioneer, John Waters. Intercut with a 1972 interview of Waters are clips from his first films and recent interviews with his parents, his brother, Divine's mom, actors and crew, other directors, film critics, a film curator, psychologists, and Maryland's last censor, who shudders at the memory of Waters's pictures. Also included is footage of Waters making his early movies, culminating in an up-close and in-depth look at Pink Flamingos: the script, the set, the filming conditions, its editing, its distribution, and its impact. In sweet ways, this documentary is also a celebration of Divine (1945-1988).
Documentary filmmaker Steve Yeager and Producer Cindy Miller have created in the film Divine Trash an excellent uncovering of the concept and philosophy involved with the filmmaker and showman John Waters including interview footage with the master of trash cinema when he was just 25-years old and completing much of the early work on his films such as Mondo Trasho, Multiple Maniacs, and especially Pink Flamingos.
