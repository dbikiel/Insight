The Peanuts gang performs the classic Broadway musical.
Charlie Brown and the Peanuts sing out as they perform excerpts from the classic musical. Charlie Brown has one of his usual bad days of loneliness and failure whether it be in the schoolyard, at the baseball diamond or at home. Meanwhile, Linus ponders his dependence on his security blanket, Linus bullies and pesters the boys, Sally Brown goes through life with her scatterbrain philosophies and Snoopy indulges in his appetites and fantasies. However, there is music to be had to see them through, until they all realize what truly makes them happy.
