Notorious outlaw Cole Younger is the only witness who can clear Kit Caswell of false murder charges leveled against him by jealous rival Jan Merlin who covets Caswell's girl, Abby Dalton.
An outlaw must decide whether to stick his neck out for an innocent man in this hardboiled post-Civil War adventure written by noir legend Daniel Mainwaring (Out of the Past) and starring Frank Lovejoy (In a Lonely Place) and James Best (The Dukes of Hazzard). Beaten and forced out of town by the corrupt state police of Texas, Kit Caswell (Best) heads to the hills where he meets the notorious desperado Cole Younger (Lovejoy). Becoming fast friends, the two take jobs on a cattle drive, unaware that a jealous rival (Jan Merlin) with eyes on Caswell's girl (Abby Dalton) has falsely accused him of murder. So when Caswell is arrested and Younger slips away, only the testimony from the outlaw himself can save Caswell from the hangman.
