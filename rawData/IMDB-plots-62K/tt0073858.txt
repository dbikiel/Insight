A young woman's life is scrutinized by police and tabloid press after she spends the night with a suspected terrorist.
Katharina Blum is a young handsome German maid. She meets Ludwig, and they fall in love at once. They spend the night together. In the morning, the police bursts in her flat, looking for Ludwig : he is a terrorist. But he was no longer here. Katharina is arrested, humiliated, suspected to be a terrorist herself, dragged in the mud by the newspapers... A plea for democracy and individual rights.
Utterly unaware that the intriguingly mysterious and handsome stranger, Ludwig GÃ¶tten, is an alleged terrorist, the innocent and apolitical housemaid, Katharina Blum, has a night of passion after a late-night party. The following morning, an armed-to-the-teeth police squad ransacks her tiny apartment, triggering an endless nightmare, as both the authoritarian right-wing police and the ruthless gutter press commence a deliberate character assassination. Now, amid rampant terrorist hysteria and savage media frenzy, the fate of the courageous Katharina lies in the hands of a handful of men. Will her life return to normalcy? Will Katharina ever restore her lost honour?
