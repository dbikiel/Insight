See what happens when the student bodies of an all-vampire school and an all-werewolf school integrate with Monster High.
Monster High is the model high school for monster integration; a melting pot where all monsters can let their fangtastic freak flags fly! But when other monster schools are merged with Monster High, the balance is upset and the school is thrown into social chaos. Our ghouls find themselves up against a convincing normie, Administrator Van Helscream, who is determined to drive a stake into the harmony of the school and magnify old grievances in order to isolate and separate the monster groups. Frankie Stein, Clawdeen Wolf, Draculaura and their ghoulfriends can only cure his agenda of intolerance if they can prove that the culture clash of Fur and Fang is no longer an issue and restore the imperfectly perfect harmony of Monster High.
