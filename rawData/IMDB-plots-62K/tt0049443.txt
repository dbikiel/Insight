In this hilarious romp starring Tom Ewell, Sheree North and Rita Moreno, a middle-aged ex-serviceman who plans to re-enlist (Ewell) is shocked to learn that not only did he fail his medical exam, his wife (North) has enlisted - and is really making the grade in the Air Force. Unhappy to be a "house husband," he flies to Hawaii to be near her - and also to hatch a scheme to get her discharged.
