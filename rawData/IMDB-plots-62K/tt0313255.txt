Barbie is an artist who paints her way out of a castle to save her prince.
Barbie is Rapunzel in this beloved story. Kidnapped by an evil witch, Rapunzel is locked in a tower and hidden from the outside world. Rapunzel goes on a journey and with the help of her friends Penelope and Hobie, she manages to get the life she deserves and live happily ever after.
Locked up in an impenetrable stone castle to serve the wicked and envious witch, Gothel, the young flaxen-haired girl, Rapunzel, can only dream of another life far away from the dense forest, and its fearsome dragon-guardian, Hugo. However, the unexpected discovery of a secret exit will pave the way for a wonderful adventure in the nearby kingdom, and a chance encounter with the charming Prince Stefan. Can Gothel keep Rapunzel forever imprisoned? Will Rapunzel's only friends--the cute white rabbit, Hobie, and the kind purple dragon, Penelope--help her find freedom and true love?
