A screwball comedy about a gay couple at a straight couple's wedding.
Screwball comedy with a modern twist; instead of Kate Hepburn and Cary Grant, it's Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart. Two college roommates (victims of a mutually unrequited love) meet up again five years after school at their housemate's wedding. With the introduction of a Bellamy-esque soap star, the sparks, sexual and verbal, start to fly, as the ex-roommates try to navigate their new romance.
