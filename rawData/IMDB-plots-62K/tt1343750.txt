Christmas trees ripped out of their forest plan revenge against people enjoying the holidays.
Foul-mouthed lumberjacks descend on a hillside of trees, cutting them down and trucking them to Christmas tree lots where families paw them, pick one out, take it home, stick it in a stand, and decorate it. The trees experience terror throughout the ordeal: we hear their squeals of pain when axed or sawn, the emotion of separation from family and friends, the fear of the unknown, and the despair they feel during the strange and bizarre rituals of families at Christmas. On Christmas morning, the trees strike back. Man, woman, child, and pet may be in for a grisly end.
In the most wonderful time of the year, it's the same old story, over and over again: overeager rednecks go berserk by stripping, axing, sawing and burning without remorse the iconic Christmas trees. Norway spruce, Douglas fir, and Colorado Blue Spruce are among the hapless and defenceless tree varieties that man traditionally showers torment and humiliation on them, only to be picked out by families like modern slaves in a slave market. But when is enough, enough? Perhaps this time, for a change, it will be humans who beg for mercy.
