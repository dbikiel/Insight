In 1965, Rudy, a Midwestern high-school kid, moves to Albuquerque; lonely and friendless, he's attracted to Kit, slightly older, with a car, his own apartment, and spending money. Kit loves Elvis and loves the ladies; plus, he's a complete phony: his tan is fake, he wears lifts, he lies to girls, and he pretends to care about Rudy. Kit also shares a dark secret with two other devoted followers, Jimmy and Martha. He meets his match in Kirsten, a spoiled rich girl who gives as good as she gets. When she and a younger cousin disappear, Rudy must choose between loneliness and the law.
