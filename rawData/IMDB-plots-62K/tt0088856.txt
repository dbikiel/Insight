A cowboy seeks to rescue, then woo, a damsel in distress. But he is constantly thwarted by the scratches, breaks, and other imperfections present in the film print itself.
An old-fashioned lonesome cowboy while passing through the flat and barren desert, much to his surprise, spots a damsel in distress tied in thick ropes to a railroad track calling for help. As the furious locomotive approaches, without delay, the selfless hero dashes to her rescue, nevertheless, an indefatigable and utterly unpredictable adversary blocks his efforts: the film's poor physical condition. Is there a way out from this celluloid horror?
