New York is the dream city of Tavo and Marina, where the lovers hope to start a better life; at home in Bogota they have to work as pocket pickers at the airport to support their families. Dealer Oskar can persuade them to smuggle drugs in their stomachs on plane to New York - although both know of the risks, since Marina's sister died on a similar journey. However on arrival at the airport in New York they show nerves and all their dreams start to shatter...
Gustavo 'Tavo' Luna and his lover Marina try to resist the dangerous drug courier business she already lost a relative to. But as decent jobs are impossible to find in their native Bogota and pocket-picking seems almost as dangerous, Tavo risks carrying cocaine as stowaway on a flight to the Antilles but is caught and jailed. To pay a lawyer to free him, Marina lets dealer Oskar enlist them as couriers on a flight to New York, where family can help them.
