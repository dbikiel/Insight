Biographical film of the life of the Greek writer Nikos Kazantzakis.
The film-biography is a tribute to the Great Awakening Writer NIKOS KAZANTZAKIS. The ecumenical writer Nikos Kazantzakis said that his life is defined by his travels and dreams. These tracks were followed by the film. The presence of the Greek spirit, which represents great ideals, is intense. Freedom, power, creation, strong friendships, dynamic spirit. All of these elements make up a heartfelt sensation that will make you feel human, feel free. "I hope nothing, I fear nothing, I am free." Nikon Kazantzakis
