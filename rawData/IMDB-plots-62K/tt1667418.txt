A group of investigators enter the former property of depraved serial killer John Wayne Gacy, hoping to find evidence of paranormal activity. Upon entering the place they set-up cameras throughout the abandoned house while going room to room with hand-held cameras, performing s√©ances and asking for John Wayne Gacy to come forward. As the evening progresses it seems the investigators are not prepared for the horror still within the house.
Taking its cues from found-footage thrillers like The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity, this "true story" follows a team of paranormal investigators who are spending the night on the site of serial killer John Wayne Gacy's former home. Although Gacy's house of horrors has long since been demolished, with another house erected in its place, the tortured spirits of his 33 victims seem to be alive and well.
