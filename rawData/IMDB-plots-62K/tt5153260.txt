An Argentinian adaptation of the Justice League series.
What would have happened if Superman's ship hadn't landed in Smallville, but in a poor city next to Buenos Aires? Based on the superb comic book by Leo Oyola, Kryptonita tells the story of an unconventional roguish Justice League (a classic Robin Hood metaphor), trying to save Kal-El's life from the police and no other than Doomsday himself. While kept hostage by Juan Raro (J'onn J'onzz), Cuñataí Güirá (Hawkgirl), El Faisán (Green Lantern), El Ráfaga (The Flash), a transvestite named Lady Di (Wonder Woman) and El Federico (Batman), a night shift doctor fights to keep Nafta Súper alive after removing a chunk of kryptonite from his side. Enjoy this fantastic reinterpretation of the Justice League, and keep an eye out for the Joker.
