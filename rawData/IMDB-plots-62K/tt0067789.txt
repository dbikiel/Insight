An old detective think that he is too young for retiring. With a help of his friends, he plans to commit 'crime of the century' and then quickly solve it. But be a criminal is much more harder than be a policeman.
An old detective does not want to retire, especially if the reason for his retire is to free a place for stupid young "promoted-by-the-tops" guy. The only way out is to convince the boss that hero still can effectively investigate complex crimes.
