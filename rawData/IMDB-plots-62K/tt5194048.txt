When the guys get trapped in the haunted building by the evil ghost of the Doctor, they do a s√©ance to talk to the spirits to let them free. But they release the ghost of the doctor's last victim, and she possesses Sofia. She begs the others to protect her from the doctor. But as the doctor starts killing them to get to Sofia, they must fight for their lives against a brutal enemy hell bent on their destruction. But they never knew who the real enemy was until it was too late.
