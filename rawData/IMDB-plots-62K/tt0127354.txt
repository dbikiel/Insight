One of the most unconventional and experimental films ever made, Wavelength is a structural film of a 45-minute long zoom in on a window over a period of a week.
In the opening scene, a woman with a fur coat enters a room with two men carrying a piece of furniture (it's difficult to make out whether it's a cabinet, a bookshelf, or another piece of furniture). The woman tells the men where to place the bookshelf. After that, they all walk out of the room. Later, the same woman returns with a female friend and the two of them listen to the song "Strawberry Fields Forever" as they drink a beverage. Eventually, both of them leave.Shortly afterwards, a low frequency wavelength starts to increase in pitch as the camera slowly zooms in on a wall (this effect is present throughout the rest of the film). Long after this, glass can be heard breaking in the distance. Shortly after that happens, footsteps can be heard getting closer until a man walks into the room. He takes a few steps, but then he collapses on the floor, and dies. The camera continues to zoom in, removing the man from the frame in the process. Much later, the same woman in the fur coat arrives and, upon seeing the man's dead body, makes a phone call and speaks about the man in a calm tone, saying she's never seen him before. The person on the other line (likely a police officer) tells her to wait downstairs. After hanging up, she walks out of the room.The camera continues to zoom in until a picture of the sea on a wall covers the frame. The frequency is also really high pitched at this point. In the final scene, a police siren is heard in the distance.Also, throughout the film, the color and brightness of the picture changes numerous times.
