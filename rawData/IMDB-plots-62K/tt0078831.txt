Completed two years after La batalla de Chile: La lucha de un pueblo sin armas - Primera parte: La insurrección de la burguesía (1975) and La batalla de Chile: La lucha de un pueblo sin armas - Segunda parte: El golpe de estado (1976), this film deals with the creation of thousands of local groups of "popular power" by ordinary workers and peasants to distribute food; occupy, guard, and run factories and farms; oppose black-market profiteering; and link together neighborhood social service organizations, first as a defense against strikes and lockouts by factory owners, tradesmen, and professional bodies opposed to the Allende government, and then increasingly as Soviet-type bodies demanding more resolute action by the government against the right.
