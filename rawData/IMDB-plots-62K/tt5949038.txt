A couple hiking out in the woods, disturb a nest of vampires.
After some bad news back at home, Musician Josh and his girlfriend Beth head out to a secluded national park in search of some clarity on the situation they'll face when they return. But the couple get more than they bargained for when they ignore the advice of Park Rangers and venture off the trail, coming face to face with The Redwood's legendary wildlife. REDWOOD brings a fresh spin to a well worn mythology to create an edge of your seat horror movie that will shred your nerves and have you thinking twice about going camping again.
