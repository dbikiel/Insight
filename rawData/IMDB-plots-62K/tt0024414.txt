Middle-aged dentist Biff Grimes reminisces about his unrequited love for beautiful Virginia Brush and her husband Hugo, his ex-friend, who betrayed him.
Hugo and Biff were friends until they met Virginia. Biff could think of no one but Virginia, but she would never be happy with a big slow bully. So she married Hugo and Biff married Amy just because his Virginia got married. Amy loves Biff, but Biff constantly thinks of Virginia even after Hugo takes his job and has him put into prison for two years.
