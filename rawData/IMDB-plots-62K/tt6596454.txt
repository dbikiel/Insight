Follows the story of a woman in her forties who becomes friend with an ex colonel and riding instructor with a shady past.
Mariana, from Chilean upper class with nothing really to occupy her days besides signing the potentially shady business documents her father keeps funneling to her, takes up riding lessons. Neglected by her husband and despised by both her father and husband, she feels a strange attraction towards her older riding instructor, Juan. But when she learns that "Colonel" Juan is under investigation for Pinochet-era human rights violations, her attraction flares into fascination, and she determines to find out the truth of his case, even if it means seducing, or rather submitting to the attentions of, a married investigator for information. Does she want him to rot in jail or take her in his arms? She doesn't quite know.
