A young hot shot driver is in the middle of a championship season and is coming apart at the seams. A former CART champion is called in to give him guidance.
Talented rookie race-car driver Jimmy Bly has started losing his focus and begins to slip in the race rankings. It's no wonder, with the immense pressure being shoveled on him by his overly ambitious promoter brother as well as Bly's romance with his arch rival's girlfriend Sophia. With much riding on Bly, car owner Carl Henry brings former racing star Joe Tanto on board to help Bly. To drive Bly back to the top of the rankings, Tanto must first deal with the emotional scars left over from a tragic racing accident which nearly took his life.
Young British talent Jimmy Bly breaks German Beau Brandenburg's car race hegemony, until his concentration suffers after a selfish girl-friend toys with their feelings. Drop-out Joe Tanto accepts as a favor to cynical stable boss Carl Henry to return on the team as coach for and rival-to-be-beaten within the team. Joe does well as wise dad and brotherly confidant, even restores a rapport with Beau, his former race rival. But the racing circuit also proves dangerous in terms of accidents, and experience with those complicates matters.
