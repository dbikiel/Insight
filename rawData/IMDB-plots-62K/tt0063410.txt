Sportswriter George Plimpton poses as a rookie quarterback for the Detroit Lions for a "Sports Illustrated" article.
George Plimpton wants to write a story for Sports Illustrated on what it is like to be a quarterback for an NFL team. No one is willing to allow a klutzy amateur to go on the field for fear he'll kill himself. After several teams turn him down, Plimpton got the Detroit Lions to let him go to training camp. He tries to keep his true identity a secret from the real players. This is based on a true incident and many of the players play themselves in the movie.
Sports writer George Plimpton has made a name for himself by putting himself into the sports arena and then writing about his experience. He's entered the ring with a professional boxer and pitched in the All-Star game. Now, he would like to try his hand at being the quarterback of a professional football team. His chance arises with the Detroit Lions. While everyone involved agrees to keep his secret (his line is that he played semi-pro football in Canada) it soon becomes apparent to all of his team mates that he hasn't got a clue. Eventually he earns their respect and even gets to play a few downs in an exhibition game. Based on a true story.
