A dozen British soldiers, lost in a Mesopotamian desert during World War I, are menaced by unseen Arab enemies.
A World War I British Army patrol is crossing the Mesopotomian desert when their commanding officer, the only one who knows their destination is killed by the bullet of unseen bandits. The patrol's sergeant keeps them heading north on the assumption that they will hit their brigade. They stop for the night at an oasis and awake the next morning to find their horses stolen, their sentry dead, the oasis surrounded and survival difficult.
While on patrol in the Mesopotamian desert in 1917, a cavalry patrol lose their officer to a sniper's bullet. The men, now led by their Sergeant, find refuge in a desert oasis. Their enemy preys on them however, slowly but effectively picking them off with sniper fire during the day and infiltrating their camp at night. In the end, only one man remains.
