Alejandra is a young mother who works her in-laws' candy factory and raises her two children, along with her husband Ángel, in a small city in Mexico. She has an unhappy marriage. Her brother Fabián is a nurse at a local hospital and lover of her husband. Their provincial lives are altered with the arrival of Veronica who becomes Fabian's girlfriend. Sex and love are fragile in certain regions where family values exist, and where hypocrisy, homophobia, and machismo are strong.
