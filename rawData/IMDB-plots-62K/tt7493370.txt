Greece in 2015: the economy is in tatters and the country is on the verge of bankruptcy. A new government rebels against the EU's iron-fisted rule and inspires millions of Europeans. Based on the political memoirs of Yanis Varoufakis.
Provides an extraordinary account of low cunning at the heart of Greece's 2015 financial bailout. The more defiant the left-wing Syriza government became, the more it was met with intimidation from some or duplicitous reassurance from others.
