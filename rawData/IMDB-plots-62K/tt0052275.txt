Dr. Sturdy is trying to establish a modern hospital in the jungle. His efforts are strongly opposed by Futa, the witch doctor, and Ramo, a native warrior. There are kidnappings, a race against time for serum, capture of Tarzan, the struggle of modern medicine against magic, etc.
Tarzan welcomes back Dr. Ken Warwick whose been away studying medicine for two years. There's trouble brewing however when the local witch doctor, Futa, sees his influence with the villagers waning in favor of the local clinic run by Dr. Sturdy and Dr. Warwick. The tribal chief has died and when his son and heir falls ill, Futa decides he is the one who has to treat him. Futa's henchman, Ramo, steals what he thinks is medicine but is actually a deadly serum. If given to the boy-chief, he will surely die. It's left to Tarzan to try and avert tragedy.
