A smart electronic technician needs his fifteen minutes of fame to scrutinise the corrupt Government, threatening to blow a building to smithereens with his devilishly intricate explosive device. Who can stop a man with nothing to lose?
A gifted electrician, Michalis Karamanos works for OTE - Greek Telecommunications Organization and it seems that he is the only one who hasn't been completely absorbed by the corrupt and all-devouring system. Acting as a member of the revolutionary organization Constitutional Struggle, which is fighting against the unpopular policy of the government, he connects the computer of the director of OTE to an explosive device. He threatens to destroy the telecommunications of the country if he is not allowed to broadcast on television his revolutionary message during the broadcast of an important football game. The Authorities, thinking that he has gone crazy, try to bring him around using his old friends from the army, whom they pick up one by one as intermediaries. This is a situation comedy with excellent, mature plot development, plenty of suspense as well as masterful criticism of socio-political reality.
Michalis Karamanos--the ingenious electronic technician and employee of the national telecommunications organisation, TEO--is at the end of his tether. Bent on making a revolutionary announcement before a live televised football match, Michalis needs his fifteen minutes of fame to scrutinise the corrupt Government, its work, and its policies, threatening to blow the entire building to smithereens with his delicate and devilishly intricate explosive device. Of course, the police won't take it lying down--and as the special forces apprehend Michalis' former brothers-in-arms--the stage seems set for the ultimate payback. Who can stand in the way of a man who has nothing to lose?
