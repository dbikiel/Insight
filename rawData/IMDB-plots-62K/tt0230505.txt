Three diverse cousins--an eligible bachelor; a young and penniless hippie; and a spirited woman who lives abroad--inherit an old mansion in Athens, only to find out that they have entirely different views on how to make good use of it.
Three completely diverse cousins--Ippokratis, an eligible bachelor; Achilleas, a young and penniless hippie; and Keti, a spirited woman who lives abroad--inherit an old mansion in Plaka, Athens. However, as both Ippokratis and Achilleas have entirely different views on how to make good use of it, the arrival from London of the third beneficiary, Keti, will further complicate matters. Is an unexpected love the missing ingredient which leads to an effective solution?
