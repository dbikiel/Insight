THE MAN WHO WAS THURSDAY is inspired by the existentialist novel of the same name by G.K. Chesterton (1908). The novel is considered a metaphysical thriller, and our film could be considered the same, though it also can be thought of in more classical cinematic terms a psychological and supernatural thriller.
The Man Who Was Thursday is a metaphysical thriller chronicling one Father Smith's Faustian descent into the Roman underworld. Following a disgraceful turn at his local parish Father Smith is called to Rome for spiritual rehabilitation. Upon his arrival Charles, the man who introduced him to the faith, reveals the real reason Smith was brought to Rome; to go underground and ascertain the mysterious leader of an anarchist group of renegades. Smith accepts this mission and ultimately unearths the true leader of the group and redeems himself but not before experiencing a litany of mind-bending twists and turns.
