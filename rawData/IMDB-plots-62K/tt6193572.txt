Mahtab is suspicious of her husband Ahmad, a university professor. As she tries to unravel the mystery instigated by Sima, a close friend of the family, by pressuring Farnoosh Kheirkhah, Ahmad's student, her husband tries to prove his innocence. But the sudden death of Farnoosh opens a new path before Ahmad, Mahtab, Sima, and her husband Mansoor.
The volatile Mahtab (Sareh Bayat) suspects her husband Ahmad (Mohammad Reza Foroutan) is having an affair with his student Farnoosh. After being tipped off by close family friend Sima (Hediyeh Tehrani) she angrily confronts her at the University where he works. However, when Farnoosh dies truths are exposed and events become increasingly complex as Sima and her husband Mansoor are inexorably immersed in the tragic situation. Themes of deception and its consequences underline this bellicose drama, with fine performances and an unnerving score that contribute to a relentlessly tense atmosphere.
