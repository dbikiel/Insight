Up in the Swiss Alps, Mickey Mouse tangles with a mother eagle, Donald Duck scraps with an edelweiss-stealing goat and Pluto gets inebriated with a St. Bernard.
Donald, Mickey, and Pluto climb the Alps. While up top, Donald has a run-in with a mountain goat over some edelweiss, Mickey has a row with an eagle over its eggs; one of them hatches, and gives Pluto some trouble (as does the grog a Saint Bernard gives him when he falls into a snowbank).
