A downtrodden waiter decides to take up matters with the screenwriter determined to make him suffer.
Edgar is a waiter in a mediocre restaurant, where clients and even his mistress prove abusive, while his sick wife and criminal neighbors are no better. How bad it gets is a matter of discussion between Edgar, script-writer Herman, his meddling girl-friend Suzie and various other characters, who regularly complain to Herman, who thus repeatedly changes the script... yet never to everyone's satisfaction, least of all his own.

the director is up to his usual tricks after his coolly received 2003 outing Grimm.Additional Details
