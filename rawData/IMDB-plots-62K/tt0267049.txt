A housewife tires of her husband's annoying behavior and returns to her mother. At first, the husband is quite pleased to have the house all to himself. But he quickly discovers that even the most basic domestic chores can be fraught with difficulty.
Having had a quarrel with his wife, a young husband is left alone at home, his better half having "gone back to mother." He chides himself into the belief that he can manage the house himself, and the manner in which he begins to clear the dishes away from the table does not discourage him. He uses a pair of gloves to wash them, but it does not work quickly enough, and he turns the hose on the whole business. When he has finally cleaned everything he drops the tray and all the dishes are smashed. He next attempts to prepare the dinner and goes out marketing. His difficulties in his accomplishment are many, but he finally reaches home. He finds plucking feathers undesirable work, so he cuts them off with a pair of shears; he places the whole chicken in a pan, throws in a sliced unpeeled potato, and spills some wine in for gravy. After a few more additions to his display of culinary ignorance he has the concoction smoking pretty well. Suddenly he finds himself about to sneeze, and raising his hands to his face he explodes so violently that his arm strikes the pan and the entire contents fall upon the floor. But he goes to bed, and after a hard scuffle with the sheets manages to fall asleep. In the morning he is unable to find his tie, and begins to upset things in a nervous search for his neckwear. After throwing out everything in that room he goes to another and pulls out and smashes all the drawers in a bureau. Frenzied, he turns to a wardrobe and is knocking tomes about in wild disorder, when the whole outfit falls on his head. As he is foundering in the wreckage his wife and her mother enter, and while the old lady faints he falls on his knees, begging for relief. -- The Moving Picture World, February 29, 1908
