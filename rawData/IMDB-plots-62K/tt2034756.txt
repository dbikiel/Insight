A woman, named Chell, wakes up in a testing facility with no memory of how she got there. The one thing on her mind, escape.
In a windowless and drab concrete cell, Chell, a young captive, is detained without recollection of who she is or how she ended up like this. Constantly monitored by her prison's camera, Chell spends her days exercising and planning her escape, however, without much hope. But then, unexpectedly, the determined woman will decipher the cell's secret and finally have a fighting chance. Can she escape?
