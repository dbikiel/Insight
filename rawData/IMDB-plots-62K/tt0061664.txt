The son of Django searches for the murderer of his father and is thereby involved in a war between two factions headed by former acquaintances of his famous parent.
One night, retired gunfighter Django and his son Jeff Tracy are having supper in their cottage when someone knocks at the door. Django opens and a man informs him that his boss, Thompson, wants to see him. Django invites the man inside and starts putting his gun-belt on. When Django turns his back to the late-night visitor, he gets shot in the back and dies. Django's son, who is only 9 years old, witnesses his father's murder and remembers the name mentioned by the intruder, Thompson. Years later, Jeff Tracy is a grown man who is handy with his six shooter. He is on a quest to find his father's murderer and the man called Thompson who apparently ordered the killing of Django. Jeff Tracy's quest leads him to the town of Topeka where a major feud is going on between two strong men bent on taking over the whole county. One man is Clay Ferguson. The other man is Thompson. Jeff Tracy lands right in the middle of the feud and is in grave danger. Luckily, a former gunslinger and friend of Django, reformed as a priest known as Father Gus Fleming, has arrived in town. He tries to dissuade Jeff Tracy from revenge and murder.
