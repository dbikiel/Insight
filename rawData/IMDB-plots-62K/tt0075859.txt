Bruce Lee has just died, but the BSI is swinging into action to salvage the situation. Aided by the brilliant professor Lucas, cells from the martial arts master are removed and grown into 3 adult Bruce Lee clones. After undergoing training to bring their skills up to the level of their 'father', the 3 are sent out to battle crime, with one sent to take on a gold smuggler, and the other 2 teaming up to shut down an evil mad scientist.
