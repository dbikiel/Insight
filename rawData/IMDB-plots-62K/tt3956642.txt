The meeting of two worlds opposed to a red light, between a pretty young woman in a car and SDF. A film filled with tenderness, with beautiful images on a topic of precariousness. It causes you to turn round in an idyllic set on the sidewalk as curious pedestrian or as a stowaway in the cabin of the conductor.
