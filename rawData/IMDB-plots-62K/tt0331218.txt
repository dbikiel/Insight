A janitor at an alien nightclub gets his wish to be a singer.
The ChubbChubbs introduces the alien inhabitants of the Planet Glorf, including Meeper, its earnest but oh so awkward hero, a singing Diva, the Zyzaks, 20 foot-tall red-eyed bullies, and the ChubbChubbs. In this debut short, Meeper valiantly tries to warn the patrons of the Ale-E-Inn, an intergalactic watering hole with its own constellation of stars, of impending danger only to find himself face to face with the toughest creatures in the universe.
