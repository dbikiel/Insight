In 1982 Peter Brosnan heard a story about an ancient Egyptian City buried in California. For thirty years he has been fighting to dig it up.
In 1923 Cecile B. DeMille made his first version of The Ten Commandments. He built a huge City of the Pharos. When he was done, it vanished. 30 years ago Peter Brosnan heard this story in a bar and decided to hunt for it. After wandering in the California dunes, he found it and now he wants to dig it up.
