The complacent life of three small town brothers is shattered when their father sells the family business from under them.
Jake McDermott, after 25 years running a fast food business, proclaims one morning that he's hated dealing with chickens the entire time and has finally sold the family restaurant. For his three sons, who counted on taking it over someday, this comes as a shock and begins to break apart their family. No longer big, carefree fish in a small pond, will the boys manage to rearrange their lives and reconcile with their parents?
Three brothers live in a small town and work at the chicken restaurant the family owns, which they hope they will run someday. But one day their father tells them two things, one that he hates the business and that he sold the land the restaurant is on. This sends the family into turmoil. The eldest son moves out. Later the two elder brothers meet the man who bought the land and his girlfriend and have some fun with them. One of them goes to work for the man and the other hangs with the girlfriend.
