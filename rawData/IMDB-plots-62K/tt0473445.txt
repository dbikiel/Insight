A C.I.A. Agent steps in to stop a former Special Forces Operative on a for-hire mission that poses a global threat.
After his own daughter was killed in Panama in 1994, former C.I.A. Agent Calvin Dexter became a private "specialist" in cases which wouldn't reach justice trough the regular legal channels. Two years later, he accepts to find Richard "Rickie" Edmonds for his pa, influential rich businessman Stephen Edmonds. Rickie left for a private Canadian war victims charity in Bosnia and went missing. Dexter discovers Rickie was beaten to a pulp and drowned for no other crime then helping street boys from the other side by Zoran Zilic and his Serbian paramilitary "order". He offers Stephen to "finish the job", as such war criminals don't go to trial. But Deputy C.I.A. Director Paul Devereaux cares only for a nuclear arms project, for which he wants to use Zilic. So C.I.A. troubleshooter Frank McBride is ordered to protect him and handle Dexter.
