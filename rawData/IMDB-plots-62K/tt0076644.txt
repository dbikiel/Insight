Sixteen years after Ruby Claire's gangster boyfriend was shot and killed by four associates, a series of gruesome murders takes place at the drive-in movie theatre she now owns. Meanwhile, the behaviour of her mute daughter Leslie is becoming increasingly strange and a visiting psychic claims that forces from beyond are out for revenge.
In 1935, a lowlife mobster, Nicky Rocco, is betrayed and executed in the swampy backwoods as his pregnant gun-moll, Ruby Claire, watches. He swears vengeance with his dying breath, and then she suddenly goes into labour. In 1951, Ruby runs a backwoods drive-in theatre, employes some ex-mobsters, and has a 16-year-old daughter, Leslie Clair, who had been mute since birth. Bizarre accidents claim the lives of one employee after another. Then Leslie shows strange behavior, and then begins to speak...in her dead father's voice. A demonic, perverted Nicky Rocco possesses the girl's body and terrorizes Ruby with levitations, telekinesis, maniacal laughing, and bizarre sexual aggression.
