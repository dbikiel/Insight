Love grows where it isn't expected in this endearing romantic comedy coming of age movie.
The movie takes us on a 20 year journey through through the life of the main character, Truly Lin. Seen mostly as a flashback to how her life wound up where it is, we follow Truly back to her senior high school year and watch as she teams up with TaiYu to break apart growing love between rivals Ouyang and Minmin. Through the course of the next year we watch all 4 teens mature, and in the end, nothing is as originally desired even though Truly and Taiyu wind up with whom they initially wanted.
