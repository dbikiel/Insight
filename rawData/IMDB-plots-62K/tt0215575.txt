A traveler at an inn is harassed by a mischievous devil in his room.
A mischievous black imp hiding in a hotel room, enjoys his privacy jumping around from the bed to the table, and then, from the chair to the priceless davenport. However, when a respectable resident arrives escorted by the landlady and her husband, before long, the furniture will begin vanishing or stacking into impossible configurations, and much to the visitor's surprise, teleport back into the room. Eventually, as the culprit manifests before the man's eyes, inevitably, pandemonium ensues. Is there a way to get rid of this nuisance?
An imp cavorts in the empty bedroom of an inn. It hides in the bureau as the innkeeper and his family escort an important guest into the room. As the guest tries to place his coat in a drawer in the bureau, it disappears and then reappears in the middle of the room. He tries again but the bureau keeps vanishing and reappearing on top of other furniture. Eventually, the imp pops out and begins to chase the man around the room. Bedlam ensues, with the room soon in disarray. By the time the innkeeper comes to investigate, the imp is again hidden, and the blame falls on the guest who is unceremoniously kicked out. Soon, the imp has the room to itself again.
