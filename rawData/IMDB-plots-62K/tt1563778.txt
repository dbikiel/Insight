Gay men and their pursuit of physical perfection.
Chiseled bodies, flawless skin, sculpted jawlines. At a
time when popular culture objectifies men more than
ever, its hard for them to avoid the pressure to possess
such physical traits. In his follow-up to The Butch Factor,
director Christopher Hines exposes how far some will go to
attain the Adonis factor the kind of god-like masculine
beauty only seen in ancient Greek sculptures.
Hines takes viewers on an eye-opening journey through
circuit parties, gay porn, and avant-garde fashion photo
shoots, all of which promote their own kinds of idealized
physiques. By capturing a diverse range of voices
from those who dedicate their lives to the pursuit of
mainstream male beauty, to those who openly spurn it The Adonis Factor ultimately poses the question: does
a mans fixation on body image make him any happier?
