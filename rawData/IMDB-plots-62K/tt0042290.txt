Sam Von Schamm The Hessian and Bugs Bunny fight it out in the little known American Revolutionary War Battle of Bagel Heights.
Yosemite Sam, as Sam von Schpamm the Hessian, attacks Bugs Bunny's fort during the Battle of Bagel Heights in the American War of Independence. In typical fashion for anyone daring to go up agains Bugs, everything backfires until Sam, ultimately, declares himself "...a Hessian without no aggression".
