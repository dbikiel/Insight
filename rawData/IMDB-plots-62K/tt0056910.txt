The friendship of Bertrand and Guillaume is complicated when the womanizing Guillaume begins to pursue a charming girl named Suzanne.
In the second of Rohmer's moral tales, he examines the relationship between two friends and a girl who at first appears easily exploited. It is a complex tale of feelings and misconceptions, acted out within the head of the main character, as part of Rohmer's attempt to more easily simulate the mindscape quality of literature within a film.
Bertrand is an 18-year-old student of pharmacology. He is shy, innocent and kind-hearted, the opposite of his best friend, Guillaume, who is a crafty lady-killer. At a caf√© they meet a girl named Suzanne, who quickly yields to Guillaume's flirtation. Guillaume invites her to a party in his house, and late in the evening he involves Bertrand in his scheme to get Suzanne into his bed. Guillaume is frightened of getting too bound up with a girl. To avoid this he alternates between seduction and repulsion towards Suzanne. Bertrand feels a kind of shameful pity for Suzanne, but when she turns back to Guillaume again and again, her lack of dignity evokes Bertrand's scorn. Bertrand is himself interested in a girl named Sophie. He tries to approach her, but his shyness is paralyzing. Guillaume says that girls like to be forced, but that is not in accordance with Bertrand's mentality. Guillaume involves Bertrand in a new scheme concerning Suzanne. They tell her that they are broke, and for some weeks they cheat her to pay all their amusements. It ends up in Suzanne being broke and even losing her job. Some months later she is married. Bertrand finds out that he is losing Sophie, while Suzanne is happy. He thinks that she is beating them all to the finish line.
