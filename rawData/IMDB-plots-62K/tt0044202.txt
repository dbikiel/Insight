A small, racially-mixed American town succumbs to violence and utter mayhem after a white man suspected of kidnapping a missing black girl is released by the white authority.
In a racially-mixed American town, a 5-year-old black girl falls unnoticed into a hidden, forgotten well on her way to school. With nothing better to go on, the police follow up a report that the child was seen with a white stranger, and rumors run wild. Before hapless, innocent Claude Packard is even found, popular hysteria has him tried and convicted. But Packard's troubles pale by comparison as ever more-inflated rumors uncap the well of racial tensions and mob violence. And young Carolyn Crawford, forgotten by most, is still missing.
Perhaps nobody saw this picture as what it really is: a racial thriller and, astonishingly for the time it was filmed, one of the first anti-racist movies ever made. Especially shocking is the scene when an angered group of whites are loading handguns and rifles to start a certain racial war, and suddenly someone arrives to tell them that the little girl was found. The leader of the group stops loading his gun, looks at him, and asks with a confused look, 'What girl?' The final scenes, with black and white people working together to save the little girl, are also a testimony to the need for cooperation among people of all races.
