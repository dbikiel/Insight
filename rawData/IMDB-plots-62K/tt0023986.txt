A working girl is menaced by her tyrannical employer.
Kurt Anderson is the tyrannical manager of a New York department store in financial straits. He thinks nothing of firing an employee of more than 20 years or of toying with the affections of every woman he meets. One such victim is Madeline, a beautiful young woman in need of a job. Anderson hires her as a salesgirl, but not before the two spend the night together. Madeline is ashamed, especially after she falls for Martin West, a rising young star at the store. Her biggest fear is that Martin finds out the truth about her "career move."
Franklin Monroe and Co., a department store established in 1878, has flourished financially under the management of Kurt Anderson, despite or because of his demanding style of management which, especially his unofficial one strike policy, rubs many people the wrong way. The stock market crash and the resulting Great Depression leads to Anderson becoming even more demanding in needing his staff to be more creative in combating slumping sales. He believes he can still expand the business and make more money while all other businesses are going in the other direction in cutting back. One of his more energetic younger executives is Martin West, who becomes his right hand man. Martin's climb up the corporate ladder may hit a broken rung as Anderson requires complete loyalty, which means not having his executive hires be married, Martin who wants to marry Madeline Walters, a model at the store. What Martin is unaware of is that Madeline's dislike of Anderson is more than that within an employee-employer relationship.
