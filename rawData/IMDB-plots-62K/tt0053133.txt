Dave Burke hires two very different debt-burdened men for a bank robbery. Suspicion and prejudice threaten to end their partnership.
Dave Burke is looking to hire two men to assist him in a bank raid: Earle Slater, a white ex-convict, and Johnny Ingram, a black gambler. Both are reluctant; but Burke arranges for Ingram's creditors to put pressure on him, while Slater feels humiliated by his failure to provide for his girlfriend; they eventually accept. But Slater loathes and despises blacks, and the tensions in the gang rapidly mount.
In New York, the former cop Dave Burke summons the veteran Earle Slater and the jazz musician Johnny Ingram to heist a bank in a small town. Slater is financially supported by his woman Lorry and feels uncomfortable with the situation. Johnny is a compulsive gambler and owes a large amount to the shark Bacco, who is threatening his ex-wife and his daughter. They both are reluctant to accept the invitation, but they need money and accept to participate in Burke's plan. However Slater is racist and does not trust in Johnny.
Bigoted, white ex-con Earl Slater teams up with Dave Burke, a dishonorably discharged former cop, to rob a bank in upstate New York. Johnny Ingram, a jazz musician with a gambling problem, reluctantly joins Slater and Burke after a hoodlum named Bacco threatens Johnny's family over unpaid debts. Everything that can go wrong with the heist does so and racially generated friction boils over as Burke and Johnny must choose the greater threat to their lives - the prejudice that divides them or the authorities nipping at their heels.
