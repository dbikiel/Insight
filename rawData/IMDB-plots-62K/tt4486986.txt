A blind woman's relationship with her husband changes when she regains her sight and discovers disturbing details about themselves.
Blinded since childhood when a hideous car-crash cost her her parents and her eyesight, beautiful Gina scarcely leaves their home in exotic Bangkok, depending entirely on her attentive and doting husband, James, who is her everything: her protector, her guide, and the sole intermediary with the outside world. And then, unexpectedly, a cutting-edge but highly experimental cornea transplant promises to restore Gina's vision, at least to her right eye--and all of a sudden--an entire realm of unexplored colours and senses gradually begins to unfold before her. As a result, Gina will see her husband and her unknown reflection in the mirror for the first time, as a bizarre and unprecedented feeling of empowerment slowly takes over. But, are things as James says? And what happens now that life isn't quite as Gina had imagined?
Gina and James have a happy marriage, despite Gina's dependence on James due to her disability. James appears to enjoy the dependence, saying that it makes him feel special. As they try for a baby, Gina prepares for a cornea transplant, which will restore the sight in one of her eyes. The surgery is a success, and Gina embraces her newfound independence. Immediately, her sex life with James suffers. To put the spark back into their marriage, James books them a holiday to Barcelona, promising Gina that he has reserved the same hotel room they had on their honeymoon. Upon their arrival, Gina claims the room is not the same, which James denies. Gina is later proven to be correct. During the trip, Gina is shown to be growing in independence and confidence while James is left behind, seemingly unable to connect to the version of her that no longer depends on him. Resentful of her diverted attention, James begins to show signs of possessiveness..
