Michael left home when he was a teenager and never looked back. Now, after the death of his sister, Chloe, he's returning home with his fiancee Juliette and his angst ridden nephew Brandon. On arrival, they realize that home isn't exactly what it used to be. With high walls surrounding the house and security cameras in every nook and cranny it's more of a military compound than anything else. Enter Gary, Michael's estranged father who, while happy to be reunited with his son and grandson, seems more distracted by other things. As the strange family reunion commences, an uninvited guest shows up and we learn bits and pieces about the real reason behind Chloe's death and why Brandon is so closed off from Michael. This fractured family will have to come together to fight the ghosts of their pasts and make it out alive!
After the gruesome death of his sister, Michael Wolffsen (HALLOWEEN's Tyler Mane) returns home with his fiancee and his recently orphaned nephew (Alex Saxon) to take care of his father Gary (Muse Watson). Gary has changed much since the last time Michael saw him: he's become extremely paranoid that a supernatural force is out to get him and is obsessed with making his home an unassailable compound. While Michael and his family initially believe that Gary is suffering from symptoms of dementia, they soon discover that Gary has a reason to be scared. Something truly evil is lurking outside the house and it won't stop until it kills off every last member of the Wolffsen family.
