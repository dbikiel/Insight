In 1876, a Canadian North West Mounted Police Constable must obtain the release of white hostages captured by the Cree tribes that are raiding Montana from their Canadian reservation.
In 1876, Duncan MacDonald joins the new, 300-member Mounted Police in western Canada, just in time for a dangerous mission. It seems the Cree Indians, raiding across the border in Montana, took two hostages for their safe return to Canada. But MacDonald, with only scout Natayo to help, will need all his diplomacy and then some to extract the captives from the midst of a thousand Cree.
