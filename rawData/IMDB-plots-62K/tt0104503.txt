A neurotic nebbish lives in 2 worlds: the fantasy of winning his dream-girl via a hit movie, and the meager existence he scrapes out from very odd jobs, such as thesping in an arty no-budget flick. His beautiful object is his next-door neighbor Angelica, who's understandably preoccupied with her own life, as an illegal immigrant and single mom. Aldolpho Rollo's writing his unending masterpiece screenplay from a walk-up NYC flat, in-between peering at debtors through his peephole. AR's hopes to win her love take wing via another angel, a shady high-roller who definitely has the self-confidence, and promises the cash Aldolpho craves, to produce the auteur's vision.
