A family lives in a house that teeters precariously on the very tip of a mountain. The balance of the house is affected not only by the family that lives inside, but also their cow, dog, cat, a passing bird, and a man with a couple of sheep who returns in a car. The slopes of the hill themselves also seem rather slippery at times.
