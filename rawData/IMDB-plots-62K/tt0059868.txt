To win the case, Chadwick woos the attract female judge, and this becomes known to attorney Boullard.

You see, Lauren is a control freak and her father wants to knock her down a peg or two, so he enlists Chadwick's help to woo her away from Plum. In return, Boullard will not tell anyone that Chadwick won a court case by wooing the judge. After getting her drunk, Chadwick pretends to sleep with Lauren much to her dismay, and she becomes upset with Chadwick until it happens again. After the second time, Lauren begins to believe she's now in love with Chadwick convinced by her Freudian background that these tendencies are latent in her subconscious.

Boullard must break them up before the unthinkable happens, and his daughter loses her virginity to Chadwick while they are still not married, so he tells Lauren what Chadwick did to her to pretend he slept with her. Now Lauren is really upset and plots to get even with Chadwick by doing the same to him except it backfires, and the two find each other out. Plum is out of the picture as Chadwick and Lauren fall in love for real without any of the shinnanigans.
