In 1869 Kentucky, a young boy and his friends set out to find a treasure chest hidden by his late father in the Florida Everglades during the Civil War.
In post-Civil War Kentucky, young Davie Burnie (Johnny Doran) becomes the unexpected heir to the family secret: a map leading to buried treasure on the Florida isle of Matecumbe. The youth, joined by four fellow adventurers, begins his search for the treasure despite deadly interference by his late father's archenemy. The angry threat of a hurricane and the presence of hostile Indians set the mood for the frantic trek to the swampy site, a destination that could provide untold wealth for the searchers, or for their evil pursuers.
