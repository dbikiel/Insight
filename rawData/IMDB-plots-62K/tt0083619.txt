A young cowboy hooks up with a legendary outlaw, and before long both are on the run from the law.
Karl Westover, an inexperienced farm boy, runs away after unintentionally killing a neighbor, whose family pursues him for vengeance. He meets Barbarosa, a gunman of near-mythical proportions, who is himself in danger from his father-in-law Don Braulio, a wealthy Mexican rancher. Don Braulio wants Barbarosa dead for marrying his daughter against the father's will. Barbarosa reluctantly takes the clumsy Karl on as a partner, as both of them look to survive the forces lining up against them.
One great legend portrays another in this critically acclaimed, highly original Western.Willie Nelson is Barbarosa, a notorious outlaw whose name is both feared and hated by residents of a Mexican village. He is married to Josephina (Isela Vega), but her father, Don Braulio (Gilbert Roland), despises him-so much, in fact, that he has given his sons the mission of killing Barbarosa. Undaunted, Barbarosa creeps into the village by night to see his wife; by day he outruns and outwits his would-be assassins.When Barbarosa meets Karl (Gary Busey), a naive farmhand also on the run for an accidental killing, he decides to teach him the tricks of his trade.
