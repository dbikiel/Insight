Kenny Starfighter is probably the most hopeless student the Hero academy of the galaxy has ever had. But in his desperate attempt in graduating he accidentally crashes on earth and meets Pontus, an earthling who accidentally stumbled upon an intergalactic crystal which gave him inhuman strength. Now Kenny must save Pontus from Rutger Oversmart who wants the powers from the crystal for himself and Pontus must save Kenny from the fate of failing school and ending up as a hairdresser.
