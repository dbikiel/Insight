Howdy Ho! Mr. Hankey, everybody's favorite piece of poo, is here to show us his line up of holly jolly Christmas songs! There's S.D. Kluger singing the Mr. Hankey theme, then we've got Mr. Mackey singing Carol of the Bells, Eric Cartman singing "O Holy Night", Jesus Christ and Santa Claus singing a medley of Christmas jingles, and even Mr. Garrison wishes all the religions of the world a Merry Christmas! It really is a Merry Christmas, a Happy Hanukkah, a Krazy Kwanza, and all the rest!
