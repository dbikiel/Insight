Inspired by Lindbergh's flight from New York to Paris, Mickey builds a plane to take Minnie for a trip involving some necking, though Minnie objects to the necking.
Mickey and his friends build an airplane from wood, using a dachshund like a rubber band. This plane never takes off, and quickly crashes into a tree. Mickey stretches his car into a semblance of an airplane, and brings Minnie along this time. Mickey is thrown from the plane, and struggles to get back in. The plane finally takes off. Mickey tries to get a kiss, but Minnie resists, and after Mickey kisses her anyway, she jumps out, using her bloomers as a parachute. Mickey crashes the plane soon after that.
