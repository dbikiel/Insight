Racism collides with corporate greed when nine strangers - one of whom has a bomb - become trapped in a Wall Street elevator.
9 people stuck on an elevator one has a ticking bomb - the other 8 will do absolutely anything to survive. The bomb cannot be defused. There is no escape and no promise of rescue. The unthinkable becomes the only reasonable solution.
In a suspense thriller, both classic and contemporary, the passengers on Elevator are squeezed so tightly by fear and panic, the only possible result is horror. With minutes to live, there is no time for civilized morals. Nine sophisticated, Wall Street party-goers reveal the real people behind the facade. Crafted by the award-winning team of Norwegian director, Stig Svendsen and writer-producer Marc Rosenberg, they create a story as chilling as Hitchcocks Psycho and as demented as Polanskis The Tenant. An amazing ensemble cast (Christopher Backus, Anita Briem, John Getz, Shirley Knight, Amanda and Rachel Pace, Devin Ratray, Tehmina Sunny, Joey Slotnick and Waleed Zuaiter) creates a pressure cooker drama you wont soon forget.Elevator, not just another Hollywood movie.
