Inept beings from the planet Kabijj land on Earth and attempt to behead all of its beings and take over the planet.
My-ik [Diedrich Bader] and Du-ug [Chris Parnell] are evil alien conquerors from the planet Kabijj. They have exactly 822,000 tilkrons (2 and half days) to behead all of mankind. Otherwise they will feel the wrath of a 100 foot giant, named Croker [Tyler Labine]. Armed with only their swords, these inept evil aliens find Earth harder to conquer than planned. Will alcohol, fast food, mad cows, and women stand in their way? Or is the Earth doomed?
