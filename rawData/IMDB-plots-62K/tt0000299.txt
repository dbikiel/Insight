Preserved by Filmoteca de Catalunya, Barcelona, PIERRETTE'S ESCAPADES retains the original hand-tinting from the film's release in 1900. Director Alice Guy adapts a brief sequence from the ballet of Arlequin and Pierrette (essentially condensing much of the narrative in under two minutes) to provide some context for a little era-appropriate dancing.
