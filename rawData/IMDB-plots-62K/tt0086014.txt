Anthology of four horror tales with a supernatural twist based on urban legends.
A collection of short stories. In one a woman who leaves her house late at night to drive to the store while a killer is loose encounters some problems. In the second an arcade whiz kid's obsession with a game leads to deadly consequences. In the third a small town priest loses his faith and decides to leave town, but in the desert is stalked by a mysterious black pick-up truck. In the final story, a family's problem with a rat is larger than they think.
Four horror tales based on urban legends. The first story 'Terror in Topanga', has a smoking addict going out to buy some cigarettes despite there being a killer in the neighborhood. The second story 'Bishop of Battle', has a teenager who becomes so good at a video game, that the game comes to life to collect him. The third story, 'The Benediction' (based on Steven Spielberg's 'Duel') has a priest whom has lost his faith, leaving his monastery and stalked on the road by a black pick-up truck from hell, literally. The fourth story 'Night of the Rat', (loosely based on 'Poltergeist') has a couple, along with their young daughter, battling a giant rat living in their suburban home.
