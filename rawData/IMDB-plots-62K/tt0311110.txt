This is the story of a dysfunctional New York family, and their attempts to reconcile.
Wealth can't spare three male generations of the dysfunctional Jewish New York Gromberg family grief or grim reality. However successful in life, Alex never felt pleasing pride or proper parental support from sprightly patriarch Mitchell, who sarcastically imposes his own values and priorities on everyone and everything. Alex starts despairing that his modern permissiveness may ruin his own bright firstborn, college-boy Asher, unlike adoring kid-brother Eli. A dorm-drug-bust pushes things to the limit -- or beyond?
Spanning three generations, the Grombergs are a highly successful, but somewhat dysfunctional New York family. Patriarch Mitchell Gromberg is having difficulty coming to grips with his looming mortality. His son, Alex, has spent his life trying to avoid becoming a younger version of his father, while Alex's son, Asher, tries to find himself as he parties away his college years. The tale revolves around Alex, who is caught in the middle of this changing family. Trying to avoid the mistakes his father made, while coming to terms with the ones he's already passed on to his own sons, Alex tries to navigate between the tricky roles he plays as father, son and husband.
The Grombergs are a prominent, dysfunctional New York family busy wallowing in their separate lives. Papa Gromberg, catching a spark in his twilight years, tries to reconcile with his son, Alex and grandson, Asher. But the younger Grombergs have their own issues--Alex is desperate to not turn out like his father, and Asher's your typical fifth-year college senior.
