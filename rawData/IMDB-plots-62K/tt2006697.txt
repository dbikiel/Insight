Bobby Yeah is a subhuman creature who experiences a series of increasingly bizarre, nightmarish encounters after stealing a malevolent baby's prized pet.
Half-human, half-bunny, Bobby Yeah, the anthropoid hybrid with the pointy ears, is by all means "sort of". Sort-of human, sort-of animal, sort-of thug. Yes, Bobby Yeah is, above all, a slow-learning infrahuman and a petty thief. And then, unexpectedly, just when Bobby is under the impression of striking gold by abducting an ectoplasmic plump larva with a tiny, yet prominent red button on its back, things will begin getting out of hand, as an irrepressible but wide-eyed curiosity takes control. Go on, Bobby, push that button and see what happens next.
