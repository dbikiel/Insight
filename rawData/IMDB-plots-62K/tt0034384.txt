When Edward Creighton leads the construction of the Western Union to unite East with West, he hires a Western reformed outlaw and a tenderfoot Eastern surveyor.
Vance Shaw gives up outlawing and goes to work for the telegraph company; his brother Jack Slade leads outlaws trying to prevent the company connecting the line between Omaha and Salt Lake City. Lots of Indian fighting and gunplay.
While escaping from a heist of a bank, the outlaw Vance Shaw helps Edward Creighton, the chief-engineer of the Western Union that is surveying the Wild West and had had an accident with a horse. In 1861, Vance regenerates and is hired to work for the Western Union with the team that is installing the poles and cable from Omaha to Salt Lake City. Vance and the engineer from Harvard Richard Blake flirt with the gorgeous Edward's sister Sue Creighton and she chooses Vance. However, his past haunts him when the outlaw Jack Slade steals the Western Union cattle disguised of Indians.
