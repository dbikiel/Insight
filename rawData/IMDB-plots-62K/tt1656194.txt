Ed (Edward Hogg) is at a crossroads in his life. In his early thirties, his unrewarding job in a call centre is getting more and more frustrating, while his career as a stand-up is not taking off in the way he hoped it would; in fact, he's starting to acknowledge he might not be a very good comedian. His love life begins to look promising when he meets artist Nathan (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett), a gorgeous younger man who quickly develops a deep affection for Ed. Yet Ed's feelings are conflicted when he recognises he is drawn to his female flatmate Elisa (Elisa Lasowski).
First-time director Tom Shkolnik's THE COMEDIAN poignantly contemplates gender and sexual identity in modern London. The film follows the life of a struggling stand-up comedian as he juggles his personal and professional passions. Using long takes and a partially improvised script, THE COMEDIAN provides a natural, realistic perspective on current LGBT issues.
