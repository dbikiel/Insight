In a dark basement, Norma hears his voice and Everio in an old Ampex tape recorder. Every time he goes down again stops. They have been palatinates their lives, and several times the recorded conversations end coinciding with the talks they hold. What worries Norma is that until that day did not know Everio, and the last thing I heard was that he hanged.
