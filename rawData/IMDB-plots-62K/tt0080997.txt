A South American quasi-revolutionary/guerilla/terrorist and a misled, admiring girl compatriot manage to kidnap the U.S. President during a diplomatic visit to Toronto. With a nondescript armored truck, crudely yet somehow elaborately rigged with high explosives (and the President trapped inside), the two terrorists keep the Secret Service at bay until in the end, Assanti is killed and Shatner has to find a way into the truck anyway.
During a visit to Toronto, the USA president is abducted by a crazed South American terrorist and held captive in an armored truck wired with explosives. A relentless secret service agent tries to rescue the president before midnight when the truck will detonate.
