In 1960s Dublin a young girl becomes involved with an older man, a much-travelled and still married land-owner.
An awkward young Irish farm girl Kate Brady moves to Dublin and shares a room with funny, outgoing Baba Brennan, where she soon meets Eugene Gaillard, a middle-aged writer, who is immediately attracted to the shy and innocent Kate, ignoring the more sophisticated Baba.
Described as a mixture of innocence and guile, Catholic Irish farm girl Kate Brady, along with her gregarious best friend Baba Brennan, moves to Dublin to pursue a more exciting life. There, the two meet worldly writer and translator Eugene Gaillard. Although both are interested in him, it is Kate who quietly pursues him. Eugene, who knows her intention, initially resists starting up with her in part because of the difference in their ages, he being twice as old as she. Learning that he is married, albeit in a failed marriage that will soon end in divorce, does not lessen her resolve to be with him. They eventually do begin a romantic relationship. Can the relationship survive their fundamental differences especially as she becomes increasingly dependent on him emotionally, or can it survive the scrutiny of her strict Catholic family and his and his wife's acerbic tongued friends.
