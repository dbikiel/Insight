After being released, a wrongfully imprisoned black man exacts vengeance on those who've crossed him via the power of his newly sentient penis, which may or may not be the result of an experiment gone wrong.
A proud black man does time in jail where he is subjected to heinous experiments. Once released, he goes about extracting vengeance on those who put him in prison. This includes both seducing their women and murdering them by a mysterious means. Then the hook is revealed - his murder weapon is his own genitals which are now enormous and super powered as a result of the experiments he endured in prison. You heard me right; he kills with his penis and you see it all!
Whether or not our protagonist Charles is subject to experimentation while in prison is subject to debate. His behavior after parole indicates otherwise, and the prison dream sequence seems to indicate that the cause of his prehensile murdering manhood is magical or spiritual in origin, as opposed to a freak effect of science.
