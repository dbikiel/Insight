In an attempt to forget his lost sweetheart, Buster takes a long trip at sea where he boards a whaling ship with a strict captain.
Buster bids goodbye to Virginia and all women, sailing away in his "Cupid." Later, without food or water, he is taken on board "The Love Nest" which has a very mean captain. A crewman who spills coffee on the captain's hand is thrown overboard. So is anyone else who bothers the captain.
After a failed attempt to finally marry the girl of his dreams, a desolate Buster has nowhere to turn to but the vastness of the ocean aboard his small boat, the "Cupid". However, a chance encounter with the "Love Nest", a large whaling ship, will introduce him to the hard life of a sailor, as its ruthless and authoritative captain teaches discipline at any given opportunity. But, can a greenhorn deckhand like Buster survive the hardships of the open sea?
When Keaton is rejected by his girl friend, he sets out in a small boat seeking forgetfulness. His troubles increase, however, when he takes refuge on a whaling ship. He quickly incurs the wrath of the despotic ship's captain. Making his escape, Buster next encounters a large flotation device which he does not recognize as a target for nautical maneuvers. It is blown to smithereens and Buster wakes up from a dream. We realize the whole story has been a dream. And Buster, to his consternation, discovers his own small boat has never left the dock.
