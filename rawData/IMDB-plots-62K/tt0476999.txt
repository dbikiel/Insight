Ruza left Belgrade for Switzerland as a young woman full of hope for a new and better life. Twentyfive years later she appears to have achieved everything: She owns a canteen in Zurich, which she manages with a firm grip and financial success. Ruza values her meticulously structured daily routine, both in her professional and private life. Ruzas's orderly world shifts when 22 year-old Ana from Sarajevo enters the scene. She feels threatened by Ana's direct and impulsive manner while at the same time she is intrigued by her zest for life. Slowly a friendship develops between these two self-willed women.
