A Hispanic teenager hides out from the law in the home of a good-natured, but rebellious, Caucasian teenage girl after killing two rednecks whom beat him up and left him for dead, leading to a collision of cultures between the two youths.
A teen girl enjoying a rare free weekend from her religious parents is suddenly confronted by a young Mexican intruder, who randomly chose her house to hide out. Seems he was badly beaten by two local thugs in a racially motivated attack and he took his revenge on the two. This put him on the run from the local bigoted sheriff. Slowly the two reveal their emotional baggage and become genuinely attracted to one another.
