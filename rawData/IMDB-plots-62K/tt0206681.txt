The film chronicles filmmaker Joel DeMott, significant other/film partner Jeff Kreines and filmmaker Mark Rance as they head to Michigan to make a low budget horror film.
Don and Jerry, factory workers who grew up on comic books and B-movies, are fulfilling a lifetime dream: they're producing their own low-budget horror movie. Jeff and Joel, lovers and cinema-verit√© filmmakers, and a friend of theirs named Mark have come out to Michigan to help the dream come true: they're shooting The Demon Lover for Don and Jerry. Two weeks after production starts, Jeff and Joel and Mark are fleeing Michigan, bullets ricocheting off the car, lives and a complete record of the events in jeopardy. The subject of this film isn't just the ups-and-downs of making a horror movie, it's about cultural snobbery, the disintegration of friendship, puppy love, violence, boredom, money... a diary about encountering the Midwest when you're from someplace else.
