A group of dangerous terrorists succeeds to get hold of a tank of the army and all its crew.
Frank McBain is a big city cop with a habit of surviving getting shot in the line of duty over a dozen times. He earns the moniker "Bulletproof". When a super-secret ultra-comfortable prototype Tank is hijacked by Guerillas on the Mexican border, McBain is sent by the government to retrieve it. Not only does his girlfriend happen to be the commander in charge of the mission, but the terrorists turn out to be a multi-national invasion force with Mexicans, Nicaraguans, Cubans, Libyans, and Soviets all teamed up to destroy America with the help of their new tank.
