The State's Chief Minister, after being questioned by a reporter, Pugazhendi, challenges him to accept the position for a day, and see for himself the challenges that face him. Pugazhendi accepts the challenge, and immediately sets about to tour the region, suspend and prosecute corrupt officials, arrest several politicians, including the Chief Minister himself, and makes swift and decisive changes that will go to assist the most vulnerable, much to the chagrin of people in power.. After the day is over, Pugazhendi will find his and his loved ones' lives in danger as the state's machinery, as well as goons, gather together to extract vengeance.
