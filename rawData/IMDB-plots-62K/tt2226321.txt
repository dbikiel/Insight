A disturbed young woman must confront her worst fears when she finds herself trapped alone in a New York City loft during the 2003 blackout.
During the New York City blackout of 2003, Kate, a struggling 30-something model with a troubled past, has just moved into her girlfriend Leah's Brooklyn loft, but already doubts about their relationship have begun to loom. When Leah leaves for the weekend, Kate unexpectedly finds herself alone in the apartment in the middle of the worst blackout in North American history. As darkness falls over the city, Kate's paranoia grows and she begins to believe someone in the building is stalking her. With no one to help her and escape out of reach, Kate is forced to confront her deepest fears as she fights to survive through the night.
A young female couple set up home in a bleak NY apartment block. Leah is a fashion photographer; Kate is a troubled former model. Leah fears that Kate is losing feelings for her, and agonizes when she takes a few days away to visit her family. While Kate is alone, NY suffers a prolonged blackout. 'Dark' echoes Polanski's 'Repulsion' in parts - a beautiful blonde tormented by her paranoid and unbalanced state of mind. Kate's decline is gradual, and with her increased self loathing, isolation and promiscuity, the film chain smokes its way to a relatively quiet climax.
