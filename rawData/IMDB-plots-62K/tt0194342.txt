American football coach Chuck Dichter has worked wonders with the Buffalo Bills, and is even confident to crown his career with a Super Bowl victory, but before the play-offs, an oyster food poisoning wipes out his first team for a month. Dan Heller, an insurance salesman and former college quarterback, who was hired, reluctantly, but his wife twisted his arm, just for practice, now has to captain and train a bunch of rookies and old-timers against the hardest adversaries. Dichter decides to sign up triple Super Bowl-winner Tommy Baker in Dan's place.
