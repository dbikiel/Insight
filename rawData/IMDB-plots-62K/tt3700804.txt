Two Americans, Ruby and expat Josh, meet on Hong Kong Island and walk, talk and have a drink together. They randomly meet a year later on the ferry to Kowloon. They walk, talk and eat together a few hours in Kowloon.
An attraction forms when a Chinese American girl visiting Hong Kong for the first time meets an American expat who shows her the way, but timing may not quite be on their side. A walk-and-talk romance set in the beautiful city of Hong Kong, the film asks the question - what happens when you meet the right person at the wrong time?
