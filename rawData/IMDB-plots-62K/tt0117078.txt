A middle-aged simple man, Egil, becomes the victim of a candid-camera in Hacke Häger's television show 'Långa näsan'. But to Häger's surprise, Egil refuses to give them his permission to broadcast it. Häger is under pressure to make a good show and broadcasts it anyhow. Hacke Häger's employer, media tycoon Sune Finåker owns 12 TV-channels, but is hungry for more power. He forms his own party and promises easy entertainment for everybody in the future. It is time for elections and with all his TV channels, there seem to be no way to stop him from getting a majority with the votes from the couch potatoes...
Sune Finaaker is the owner of twelve commercially financed TV-channels in Sweden, filled with stupid kinds of quiz shows etc. But when Egil Rosen is made fun of in "Laanga Naesan", a hidden camera type of program, things have gone too far. The compere is astonished when he doesn't want to come to the studio when it's shown - do they actually exist - people that don't want to appear on TV? Together with the intellectual middle-aged teacher Clairy Blomstedt, he decides to put an end to Sunes plans of becoming prime minister with his new party the Fin democrats.
