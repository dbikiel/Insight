Against the backdrop of an ongoing socio-economic collapse, a disillusioned mother of three is trapped in a vicious circle of terrible decisions and sharply ruthless actions. What can drive a perfectly normal individual to great extremes?
Running away on the highway, Maria is alone in her roaring SUV. Behind her, fire and a case full of money. In front of her, the hopeless vastness of the motorway. Only a day before she was a caring mother, a loving wife, a responsible daughter. Today she has gone rogue.
From the carefree days at the beach as an enthusiastic law-school freshman to the harsh reality of a grim present, nothing really changed, and yet, nothing remained the same in the life of Maria--then, a bright and ambitious teenager, and now, a disillusioned woman and a struggling mother of three against the backdrop of Greece's ongoing socio-economic collapse. Little by little, as every aspect in Maria's life falls apart, an imminent and utterly violent outburst will pave the way for a never-ending chain of terrible decisions and sharply ruthless actions of a woman clearly at the end of her tether. In the end, what can drive a once-perfectly-normal individual to great extremes?
