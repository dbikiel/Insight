A guy fed up with his job and married to a cheating wife reluctantly mentors a rebellious teen.
Bill is unhappy: he has married a banker's daughter and has a dead end job at the bank; his wife Jess is tied to daddy's wallet; and, Bill is developing a gut from lack of exercise and constantly eating candy bars. He dreams of buying a donut franchise to be independent of Jess's dad. Bill is roped into a mentoring program at his old prep school, assigned a smart-mouthed kid who pops up when least expected. When Jess starts an affair with Chip, a local TV personality and vain Rob Lowe look-alike, it sends Bill, the kid, and a young sales clerk from a lingerie shop on a quest to win back Jess and get the donuts. What about self-respect?
Fed up with his job, his wife, and his life, Bill (Aaron Eckhart) finds himself the reluctant mentor of an unruly, but curiously wise, teenager (Logan Lerman). Bill's life hits an all time low when he catches his wife (Elizabeth Banks) having an affair with a local news anchor (Timothy Olyphant). With nothing left to lose, he turns to the kid for inspiration and regains his lost sense of self.
