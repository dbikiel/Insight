A Spanish politician whose high-class lifestyle is based on nefarious and illegal business threatens to break his entire party after a newspaper expose him to the public eye.
2007. Manuel López-Vidal is a veteran Spanish politician and the right-hand of Frías, autonomous community's president (working as member of Spain's governing party), who he has an upper high-class lifestyle with his wife Inés and his teen daughter Nati. But behind of his long carrier and the respect of his party's partners and friends as Cabrera, Bermejo, Gallardo and Fernando, truth is totally different: Manuel is a crooked and corrupt man who since many years ago uses his politic position together his friends deviating foreign aids and getting money by means of any illegal way. When Gallardo is arrested accused of fraud and politic corruption, Manuel warms all his friends about to keep silence hoping that the police forgets the case by not founding new evidences. But when it's revealed in the newspapers that himself has been recorded in personal conversations talking about it, the fictional world of respect and honor created by Manuel falls down. With the elections closing the next year, the party closes ranks to save itself from the crisis: Frías distances from him to keep clean his name, the rest of partners blame him of their own corruptions and Manuel feels that there is a traitor close to him sending information to the police. Taking desperate measures, Manuel meets Alvarado, the newest politician of the party, to make a deal: give him all evidences he finds and Alvarado helps Manuel to avoid the jail. With time running out, Manuel starts a race against the clock to find evidences and proofs trying to ruin his former friends, looking for destroy the own party if he finally is found guilty in the incoming trial. But will can Manuel get these evidences to save himself before the party take extreme measures against him?
