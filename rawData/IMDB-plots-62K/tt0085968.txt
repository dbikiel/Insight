Being a teenager can be hard enough. Being an Italian teenager in a very Australian suburb can be impossible. Gino wants to be an Australian...after all... we're all New Aussies some are just newer than others. Gino doesn't give up and when he finally wins the friendship of his Australian mates.. It's time to move out.
