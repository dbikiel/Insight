Crime scene photographer, Johnny Scardino (aka Johnny Skidmarks), is working on the side for a group of blackmailers, photographing wealthy guys in seedy motels with prostitutes. One such assignment turns the wrong way and the blackmailers he works for start dying one by one in more and more brutal ways. Is Johnny the next on the list?
