In 1920s and 1930s New Zealand, Janet Frame grows up in a poor family with lots of brothers and sisters. Already at an early age she is different from the other kids. She gets an education as a teacher but since she is considered abnormal she stays at a mental institution for eight years. Success comes when she starts to write novels.
This is the bio of the great fiction writer, Janet Frame, based on her trio of autobiographical works. It covers her life in New Zealand as she grows up in a loving but poor family. Her relationship with her doting parents, one brother and three cherished sisters makeup the first part of the film. She was a brilliant child who, as a teen, was misdiagnosed as having schizophrenia. The result of that diagnosis is portrayed in stark detail. The last third of the film covers Janet's exploration of the world and her life in Europe as her books are published to acclaim.
