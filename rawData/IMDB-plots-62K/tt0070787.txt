The million dollars turns out to be counterfeit, and tied to a wealthy man from Hong Kong named Kumada whose million dollars comes from illegal means. Previous agent's who acted as couriers have previously ended up dead; and now that Bolt has been put on the job, he is targeted for death.Bolt makes a stop in Las Vegas to verify if the money he is carrying is real. However, once Bolt's girlfriend (a singer in Las Vegas named Samantha Nightingale) is killed and a friend who verified the money, Connie, is ruffed up, Bolt seeks revenge...even having a liason with Kumada's beautiful mistress, Dominique Kuan.Before Bolt eventually comes across Kumada, he disrupts the man's businesses by blowing up power factories, and besting Kumada's henchman Spider.
