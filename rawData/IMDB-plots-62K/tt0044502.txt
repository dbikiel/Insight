Mae Doyle comes back to her hometown a cynical woman. Her brother Joe fears that his love, fish cannery worker Peggy, may wind up like Mae. Mae marries Jerry and has a baby; she is happy but restless, drawn to Jerry's friend Earl.
The bitter and cynical Mae Doyle returns to the fishing village where she was raised after deceptive loves and life in New York. She meets her brother, the fisherman Joe Doyle, and he lodges her in his home. Mae is courted by Jerry D'Amato, a good and naive man that owns the boat where Joe works, and he introduces his brutal friend Earl Pfeiffer, who works as theater's projectionist and is cheated by his wife. She does not like Earl and his jokes, but Jerry considers him his friend and they frequently see each other. Mae decides to accept the proposal of Jerry and they get married and one year later they have a baby girl. When the wife of Earl leaves him, he becomes depressed and Mae, who is bored with her loveless marriage, has an affair with him.
First viewed Clash by Night on 5/30/10 on TCM. Very good script from a play by Clifford Odets. What stood out were the parallels with A Streetcar Named Desire. Stanwyk plays the Blanche part as Mae Doyle, but she is much tougher than Blanche. Robert Ryan is excellent in the part of Earl Pfeiffer. He is direct in his approach to Mae and sees through her just as Stanley saw through Blanche. Unlike Stanley, Earl eventually reveals his vulnerability and desparate loneliness, making him and Mae (in his opinion) two of a kind. Mae is interesting because of the demands she makes on life; her past is one of dreams that didn't work out, Although the plot development is fairly predictable, there are some twists and some very good dramatic dialogue. And Marilyn Monroe shows a lot of the promise she would later realize in her more feminine turns, such as in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. If you haven't seen Clash by Night, you are missing one of the better early fifties films.
