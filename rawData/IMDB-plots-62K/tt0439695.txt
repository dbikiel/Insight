Mia, who's living in Stockholm, comes home to her small childhood town to celebrate her father's birthday. There she finds herself looked down-upon by her oldest sister; and she has to confront both her sisters when her father decides to give her the cabin by the lake, a place sought-after by both of her sisters. She visits some people who are still living in the small town, and all seem quite content with the lives they're leading. However, as the story progresses it becomes more and more noticeable that none of the characters feel good about how they live.
Mia returns from Stockholm to her parents' home in a small town in Dalecarlia (Dalarna) to celebrate her father's 70th birthday. Her elder sisters Eivor and Gunilla welcome her, but their different lifestyles prevent them from really communicating. The tension builds, and the party that should be a celebration turns out to be a turning point for the family and their friends.
The story revolves around three sisters who grew up together in a small village in the province of Dalecarlia. The youngest sister, Mia, who left home at an early age for a bigcity life, returns to join the celebration of her father's 70th birthday. At the community centre the party starts. Old conflicts are brought to life, the pace accelerates, and pretty soon it's not only the cat who's in trouble.
