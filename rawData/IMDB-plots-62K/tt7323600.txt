Paranoia &amp; Superstition in 15th Century Europe.
The dark legend of the young woman Albrun and her struggle to preserve her own sanity, and tries to explore the fine line between ancient magic, faith and madness at a time when pagan beliefs in witches and nature spirits spread fear and terror in the minds of the rural population.
In the remote Austrian alps in the 15th century, superstition reigns supreme. While plague stalks the land, paranoid peasants swap cautionary folk tales about evil spirits, pagans, Jews and other outsiders. Viewed with suspicion by their neighbors, young Albrun and her mother share a humble log-cabin farm nestled in a snowy mountain woodland. Orphaned at a young age, Albrun is left traumatized and alone, though she still hears her mother's ghostly voice calling her in the dead of night. Jumping forward 20 years, adult Albrun (Aleksandra Cwen) is now a single mother herself, still living on the forest farm with a newborn baby. The local priest shuns her and neighbors still routinely bully her: "Nobody wants your rotten milk, you ugly witch." One villager lures Albrun unto an uneasy friendship, but her motives prove malevolent, enticing the younger woman in a macabre sadomasochistic sex ritual. The final act sees a brutalized, ostracized, possibly insane Albrun descend into a psychedelic nightmare of infernal visions and cannibalistic horrors.
