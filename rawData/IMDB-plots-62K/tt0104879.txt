A down-on-his luck beach bum asks a cute female genie to help him seduce the woman of his dreams only to realize that he might be looking in the wrong place.
A romantically hapless young man (Scott) has his life changed when he finds the proverbial genie-in-a-bottle, in this case a very comely lass (Jeannie). With Jeannie granting wishes left and right, Scott soon has a fine house, a wonderful car, and a chance to impress the girl of his dreams. But is this the way to true happiness?
