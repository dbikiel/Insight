A maniac terrorizes a town during rainy nights. And exactly on one rainy night a student has a night shift in a 24hour shop. And exactly on this night the owner of the shop goes to play in a casino, his wife wants to be entertained, a detective is awaiting for a crime to be committed and certainly... the maniac begins hunting.
