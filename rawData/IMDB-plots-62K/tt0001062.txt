Set in an early cinema house, this comic short illustrates the problems with the gals' hats obscuring the movie patron's line of vision.
A gentleman with a top hat, and a series of women with ever more ludicrous hats enter a movie theatre. They refuse to remove them, until a giant bucket forcibly removes one hat. All but one woman then remove their hats, and the bucket returns to remove the woman.
It is often you are annoyed by the fact that it is simply impossible to see the screen of a motion picture show owing to the enormous size of some of the lady spectators' headgear. Persuasion, pleading, prayers, are all in vain, and so the Biograph set to work to invent a contrivance to remedy the evil, a demonstration of which is shown in this picture. The scene is the interior of a motion picture theater during the performance of which the ladies with the big hats are very much in evidence. From the ceiling are let down grappling tongs which clutch the offending millinery hauling it up out of sight. This is a comedy picture too funny for description, and it would make a splendid subject to start a show with instead of the customary slide.
