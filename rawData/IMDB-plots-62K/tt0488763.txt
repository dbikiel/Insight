In ancient Korea, the Prince of Beahae has been assassinated and the kingdom is in turmoil. The only hope lies with So-Ha, a beautiful but deadly female warrior, who is sent to find Prince Jeong and place him on the throne after years of exile. The killer blade army has other ideas, dispatching a host of fighters to stop So-Ha including the icy female assassin Mae.
