An American infantry unit, from its pre-invasion training to combat in Europe.
1944. 2nd Lt Joe Mallory, fresh out of Officer Candidate School, takes command of a veteran platoon of the US 1st Infantry Division. The company commander, Captain Tom Hale, is the former commander of the platoon and a tough taskmaster. Luckily Mallory has a very capable and experienced platoon sergeant, Pete Bell. The allies will soon invade Nazi-occupied France and Mallory's leadership abilities will be tested to the limit.
