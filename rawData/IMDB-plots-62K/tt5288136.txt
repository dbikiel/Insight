A woman falls for a guy who bullied her in high school.
Botanist, Jenny Taft, has traveled all over the world with her boyfriend, Owen, in search of the rare heart orchid. There's a myth that states that the rare flower will only bloom when a couple finds true love, but Jenny doesn't buy into it. When Jenny heads out to California to assist her mother Eileen with the sale of her childhood home, Jenny is flooded with memories of the cruel treatment she received as a teenager. As luck would have it, Jenny bumps into her high-school crush Shane, now a teacher at their alma mater. In hopes of making amends for the mean prom night prank he played on her so many years ago, he now asks Jenny to accompany him to the prom he's chaperoning. Jenny finds herself torn between her relationship with Owen and re-kindled feelings for Shane. Will a kiss from one or the other get the heart orchid to finally bloom?
