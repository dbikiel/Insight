A self-loathing bank robber forms an uneasy alliance with a resourceful Mexican prospector to save his family from a murderous former partner-in-crime.
After being captured during a bank robbery, a cowboy is sent to a prison located in a swamp, where he contracts malaria. He soon escapes and, with the help of a Mexican, sets out to track down his partner, who escaped from the bank robbery with all the money.
Miguel is a prospector who works for a one-legged man, Coyote, but he has ambitions of moving to New York to become an artist. James Cooper is an outlaw who just wants to store his loot to get away from the life he leads to make a better place for his wife and their daughter, who does not know of her true parentage. After a bank heist (which included Miguel's money), he is betrayed by his partner in crime Moxon and is sentenced to hard labor in the marshes, where he contracts malaria. After escaping, he sets out to get revenge on Moxon, who has stolen his loot and kidnapped his wife and daughter. With the help of Miguel, the two must now face this merciless enemy and his gunslingers.
