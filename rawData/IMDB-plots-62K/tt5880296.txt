Hermia &amp; Helena is a film of dead ends and new beginnings, navigating different hemispheres and languages with amorous detours, where the written words of Shakespeare clash with the entanglements of modern, digital life.
Camila, a young Argentine theater director, travels from Buenos Aires to New York to attend an artistic residency to develop a Spanish translation of Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream." Upon her arrival, she begins to receive a series of mysterious postcards which set her down a winding path through her past and towards her future.
