A serial killer is loose at an all girl school, where he strangles girls with a piece of barbed wire.
People are getting murdered down under via a barbed wire noose and then their eyes are gouged out. There are a variety of suspects at a nearby girls boarding school including students, teachers, and a nun. We also follow a rivalry between the local surfer townies and a group of preppy guys from a local all-boys school.
