Two men wearing boxing gloves prepare to spar in the Edison Company studio.
Two men wearing boxing gloves stand in a simulated boxing ring in the Thomas Edison Company studio. The man on the left takes up a boxing stance and moves his fists as if looking for an opportunity to land a blow. But the man on the right leans back, away from his opponent, keeping his arms back or to his side, and smiling at the other boxer's efforts.
