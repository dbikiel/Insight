It's a post-Christmas play-date and the toys have to go up against the fearsome and aggressive new dino toys.
The story takes place after a Christmas holiday with the regular toys finding themselves trapped in unusual territory with a group of new and delusional action figures. Together they must find their way back to their child's bedroom and to safety.
