A young woman looking to escape her life is rescued on the highway by a friendly couple in an RV. But as the miles pass the couple's motives come into question and a strange mother/daughter relationship evolves.
Young Alice has hit the road in her beat-up Ford Escort, escaping from her dead end life in small town New England. She's off to Florida, following her friend Julie who's gone to college in Miami. But Alice gets into trouble on the road, and she's saved by Sandra and Bill, an older couple in an RV. They take Alice under their wing, but are they really good samaritans, or did they have something else in mind? And is Alice telling the truth to them about herself?
