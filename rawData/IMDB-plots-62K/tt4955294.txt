Taking place 2,400 years in the past, Prologue depicts a brutal battle between two teams of Spartan and Athenian warriors.
During the Peloponnesian War some 2,400 years ago, a wide and fragrant field in spring becomes the fierce and fateful battleground for two opposing armies: the Athenians of the Delian League, and the Spartans of the Peloponnesian League. Man against man and sword against spear, the soldiers are determined to sacrifice themselves for a greater purpose--the blood-soaked soil under their feet is the ultimate proof. But from afar, a young witness stains her precious innocence with the horrors of men. Is war the answer?
