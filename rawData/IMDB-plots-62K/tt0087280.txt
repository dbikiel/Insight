His former mentor and role model, author of a treatise called "The Element of Crime", asks him to solve a series of murders involving lottery ticket sellers. Guided by the theories put forth in the book, Fischer retraces the steps of a suspect, Harry Grey, as recorded in a three-year-old police surveillance report.
A European police detective living in Cairo undergoes hypnosis therapy to deal with headaches caused by his last case. He recounts spending two months in a dystopian Europe investigating the serial killings of young girls who sell lottery tickets.
