In this television adaptation of the Harold Pinter classic, a seedy poet (Sir John Gielgud) shows up at the house of a rich writer (Sir Ralph Richardson) and they start reminiscing about the "past".
A seedy ostensible poet, Spooner, visits the home of his wealthy and successful counterpart, Hirst. Their conversation suggests that they have come there after meeting in a pub. Further conversation suggests that they knew each other at university and share acquaintances and perhaps even lovers. Hirst's associates/assistants Foster and Briggs do their best to intimidate Spooner.
