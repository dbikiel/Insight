Brass Bancroft and his sidekick Gabby Watters are recruited onto the secret service and go undercover to crack a ruthless gang that smuggles illegal aliens.
Illegal aliens are being flown in from Mexico by small plane. When a Secret Service agent finds out, he is killed and the smuggling is shut down for awhile. Brass, an ex-Navy flyer who is now flying the Pacific Clipper route, is chosen by the Service to find out who is behind this smuggling ring. Since they know that an ex-smuggler named Ace was part of the gang, Brass is put into the general prison population to try to get information from him. It is from Ace that he learns where the smugglers are located, but it is up to Brass to infiltrate the ring and bring the head man across the border to be arrested.
Commercial airline pilot Brass Bancroft joins the U.S. Secret Service and goes undercover to smash an alien smuggling ring. To create his cover, Brass is convicted of smuggling counterfeit currency and makes contact with a gang member in prison. His escape is arranged and he makes his way to Mexico. He is soon flying for the crooks but his cover is almost blown when his ex-cell-mate suddenly appears. He and his Secret Secret supervisor set a trap for the crooks enticing the leader to make a trip to the U.S.

Working from inside the gang, led by Jim Cameron, "Brass", with the aid of his pal, "Gabby" Watters and secret-service agent Saxby, is instrumental into bringing the gang to justice.
