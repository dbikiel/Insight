After ten years of doing nothing, Orel and Gringe are in their mid 30s and they struggle to finish their first rap album. Their texts are mostly sex jokes and booze stories and reflect the everyday life they have in a small town from France. The problem is that they never really finished a song and when their producers want to meet, they have to face a new challenge : finish their first song in the next 24h. Their old issues, the fear of failure, their alcoholic friends and annoying girlfriends won't help them to do so, or will they ?
Orelsan is a french rapper who lives in Caen, in France. He works nights in an Hotel. At one point he's rap partner Gringe and himself are summoned by their producers, Ablaye and Skread. They threaten to stop funding them. To avoid this, Gringe promises to finish a song within a day. For the next 24 hours, while Orelsan is trying to work on that song, Gringe is too busy trying to seduce younger girls and partying. Finally, they get on the same page and work on this song in the last hour, fulfilling their bet with the producers.
