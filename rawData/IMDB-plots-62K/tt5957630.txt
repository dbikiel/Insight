In a small Argentinian backwater town, a young woman sets out on a solitary search for her sister who has disappeared without a trace. When the family's car appears in flames on the bank of a nearby river, Alba falls deeper into a world of bureaucratic frustrations, bringing her to the edge of despair. Her journey drags her back to the river, where a silent witness seems to provide the only calm that's left.
