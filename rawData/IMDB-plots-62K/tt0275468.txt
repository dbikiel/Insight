Billy Byrne is going to be the Next Big Thing - the next pop idol, the next art scandal, the next screen dream. Doors and worlds of possibility open up. Then it all goes wrong. The world doesn't care about his style, his voice, his thing.
The clock is ticking towards The Last Minute, but no one knows it. No one except Billy Byrne - young, cool and talented, he's the Next Big Thing. At least that's what the London glitterazzi are saying, on the streets, in the clubs, in the Business. But the glitterazzi turn out to be wrong and Billy Byrne is all over in a split second. His world detonates. His self-esteem splinters. Suddenly he's on a rollercoaster ride into the London underworld - a dangerous land of murderers, thieves and talent agents.
