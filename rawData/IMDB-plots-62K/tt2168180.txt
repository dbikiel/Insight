Based on the true story of Dr. Nise da Silveira, a psychiatrist in Brazil who treated her patients with art instead of electroshock therapy.
A miracle happened in Brazil on the 1950's. Renowned modern art museums opened their doors to artists nobody ever heard of. Many critics pointed out that theses exhibitions revealed painters that should be ranked amongst the best brazillian artists of the century. It was written that this explosion of art and beauty was a sign that something comparable to the renaissance was happening in Riio de Janeiro. Behind this miracle there was no art academy, patron or dealer, only a psychiatrist, ridiculed by her colleagues, and a painting studio at a mental hospital, in the outskirts of town. The artists were schizophrenic, poor, hospitalized for several decades, abandoned by their families and hopeless according to their doctors. This film tells the story of this "Miracle" and the life of this rebellious, frail and engaging psychiatrist: Dra. Nise da Silveira.
After being released from prison, Dr. Nise da Silveira is back at work in a psychiatric hospital on the outskirts of Rio de Janeirom where she refuses to employ the new and violent electroshock in the treatment of schizophrenics. Ridiculed by doctors, she is forced to take on the abandoned Sector for Occupational Therapy, where she would start a revolution through paintings, animals and love.
