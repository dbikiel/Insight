Petronel, an angel, is still working at the Heaven's gates but is confident that he deserves a better function. His everlasting tempter Uriah, a devil, takes up tempting him. All one has to do to know all that God knows is pick an apple from the tree of knowledge. And then, the route to the well-deserved acknowledgment is free. Petronel and Uriah than proceed to argue about the apple, ant the results are catastrophic. The precious fruit falls all the way down to the Earth. The confused angel and his friend, the devil-tempter, have to quickly enter the human world, find the apple of Knowledge and bring it back. The night before Saint Nicolase's day they get tangled up in a peculiar whirl. They meet little Anezka and her beautiful mother, a crew of deceitful carolers, the greedy Kost√°l and a likable Sausage-seller. Before they manage to find the apple and bring it back where it belongs, they first have to endure a great adventure and get through quite a few dangerous setups.
Angel Petronel still works at the Heaven's door, but he believes he deserves a better position. His permanent tempter, devil Uriah, begins to incite him. 'It only takes plucking an apple from the Tree of Knowledge and you will know what only God knows! Then the path to the recognition you deserve will be free.' The argument between Petronel and Uriah over the Apple of Knowledge ends unfavourably though. In their fight the precious fruit rolls down on Earth. The muddle-headed angel and his inciting friend devil must swiftly enter the world to find the Apple of Knowledge and bring it back.
