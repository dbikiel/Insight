Follows three men who are in love with a most beautiful waitress: An intellectual restaurant owner, a mysterious musician and an erratic businessman; taking place during the WWII.
Budapest in the thirties. The restaurant owner Laszlo hires the pianist András to play in his restaurant. Both men fall in love with the beautiful waitress Ilona who inspires András to his only composition. His song of Gloomy Sunday is, at first, loved and then feared, for its melancholic melody triggers off a chain of suicides. The fragile balance of the erotic ménage à trois is sent off kilter when the German Hans goes and falls in love with Ilona as well.
The various facets of mans innermost feelings, juxtaposed with the romantic arena which was decimated by the brutal power of the Nazis, is the underlining feel of this period drama. An out an out romantic story involving two men and a woman, the story just gives a pointer to how many such dulcet romances was terminated, albeit mercilessly, by the vanity of the people who ran the Third Reich . The story revolves around characters associated with monuments which have stood the test of time, a Jew restaurant named Szabó, and a song which lends the film its title, Gloomy Sunday. Contrary to the musical fiber of the story, the film ends in true whodunit style, a la Citizen Kane.
