A talented boxer and a gifted dancer hope to increase their waning popularity by inventing a fictitious love affair for the benefit of the tabloids.
The managers of heavyweight champion Larry Cain and Broadway musical star Mabel O'Dare scheme up a romance to give the celebrities more glamour. But the two don't hit it off, having started on the wrong foot.
Although Larry Cain is a successful boxing contender and up-and-coming stage hoofer Mabel O'Dare is a dancing star of the future, the pair's lack of charisma in the eyes of the public seems to be holding them back... him from the heavyweight championship and her from Broadway super-stardom. Wisecracking reporter turned public relations man Aloysius K. Reilley dreams up the idea of ginning up interest in the lackluster pair by inventing a tabloid romance between the two, which hopefully will ignite their popularity and respective careers. That's not going to be easy because the former neighbors already dislike each other, but Reilly and their handlers have a few tricks up their sleeves for the pair of reluctant lovebirds and vice-versa.
