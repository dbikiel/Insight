A psychotic criminal couple kidnaps a random teenage couple. The woman rapes the male captive, and lets him watch his lover being raped by the man. They then plan to sacrifice the couple.
Rough girl Perdita and her demonic lover Romeo Dolorosa need humans to sacrifice following Romeo's religion before he can go on a mission ordered by mob boss Santos. They kidnap teen sweethearts Duane and Estelle and travel with them to Las-Vegas.
Perdita Durango meets Romeo Dolorosa, a criminal who is some sort of priest of a satanic cult and keeps crossing the Mexican-US border safely. He's asked to do a job for crime boss Santos, involving the traffic of human foetuses for the cosmetic industry. Meanwhile, he needs to make a sacrifice to please his gods and a young American couple comes in his and Perdita's way. They are being followed by an unlucky DEA agent, the father of the kidnapped girl, an old partner which Romeo double-crossed and the previous boss to whom he owes a lot of money. He doesn't like what he reads in the cards...
