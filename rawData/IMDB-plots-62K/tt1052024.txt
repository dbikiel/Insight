After discovering a pair of young ghosts, a nebbish 11-year-old agrees to help the sibling spirits solve the mystery surrounding their demise.
Further complications beset the life of young, aspiring magician Max when he finds only he can see and hear the ghosts that have come to reside in his family's relatively new home (former home of the ghosts). Like Max, two of the ghosts are children, who also need a living person to help them defeat an evil apparition named Phears aiming to capture them and release mean spirits back into the world on Halloween.
