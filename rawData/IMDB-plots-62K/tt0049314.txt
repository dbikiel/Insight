A spoiled heiress must choose among three suitors: her jazz musician ex-husband, a stuffy businessman, and an undercover tabloid reporter.
C.K. Dexter-Haven, a successful popular jazz musician, lives in a mansion near his ex-wife's Tracy Lord's family estate. She is on the verge of marrying a man blander and safer than Dex, who tries to win Tracy's heart again. Mike Connor, an undercover tabloid reporter, also falls for Tracy while covering the nuptials for Spy magazine. Tracy must choose between the three men as she discovers that "safe" can mean "deadly dull" when it comes to husbands and life.
Tracy Lord is a spoiled heiress who is about to marry George Kittredge. Her ex-husband C.K. "Dex" Dexter-Haven, to whom she was married for a relatively short time, is a musician who lives next door. Tracy is meticulous about everything that she does and having her ex-husband around isn't part of her plan. Dex however would like her back. Things get complicated when Spy magazine assigns one of its reporters, Mike Connors, to cover the wedding. Soon, he too finds himself falling in love with Tracy. With three men now wanting her, Tracy finds herself having to decide what she really wants in life.
Tracy Lord, a holier-than-thou ice goddess who, having been through one marriage to likable musician C.K. Dexter Haven, is about to enter another with a rather stuffy, boring social climber. Dexter and Mike Connor, a reporter covering the nuptials, help Tracy find her human side and realize whom she really should marry.
Childhood friends Tracy Lord and C.K. Dexter Haven got married and quickly divorced. Now Tracy is about to marry again, this time to a shrewd social-climbing businessman. Bing still loves her. Spy magazine blackmails Grace's family by threatening to reveal her playboy father's exploits if not allowed to cover the wedding.
