When an island off the coast of Ireland is invaded by bloodsucking aliens, the heroes discover that getting drunk is the only way to survive.
Police officer Lisa Nolan comes to Aran Island, Ireland, to take charge during a colleague's two-week holiday. Simultaneously, blood-thirsty, sea-dwelling aliens arrive at the quiet island to propagate. As dead whales wash up on shore and people start mysteriously disappearing, officers and a few locals slowly discover their peril along with one sure defense - high blood alcohol levels, which the aliens can't stomach. As a storm approaches, enabling hungry hatchlings access to the locals, an open bar kicks off a desperate bid for survival as inebriated police and friends stagger to remain cognizant long enough to thwart the alien invasion.
In the isolated fishing community of Erin Island off the coast of Ireland, the always semi-inebriated Garda, Ciar√°n O'Shea, and his new big-city partner, Lisa Nolan, have their work cut out for them when an extraterrestrial strain of Lovecraftian blood-sucking invaders begin to wreak havoc. But after the chance discovery of the hideous creatures' unexpected aversion to those booze-soaked locals with a high blood-alcohol rate, the entire village will draw themselves into a Bacchanalian lock-in at the local pub, in high hopes of staying alive. However, when is enough alcohol, enough?
