Leo the dishwasher falls in love with a bride on the day of her wedding - to another man.
In this romantic comedy, The Right Kind of Wrong, Leo Palamino is a failed-writer-turned-dishwasher made famous for his many flaws and shortcomings in a blog called "Why You Suck," a huge Internet success written by his ex-wife. Then Leo meets Colette, the girl of his dreams... on the day she is marrying the perfect man. And so, the ultimate underdog story begins as Leo, a fearless dreamer, risks all to show Colette and the whole wide world all that is right with a man famous for being wrong.
Leo Palamino has dedicated his life to what some may call impossible dreams. At least his ex-wife Julie would call them that. But Leo is an expert at not listening to her criticism or anyone else's for that matter because Leo is a stubborn romantic... An idealist. A dreamer. And to dream big, impossible dreams you can't listen to the people who tell you that's what those dreams are. It is precisely this refusal to listen to criticism that drove his ex-wife Julie to blog about Leo's flaws as their relationship broke down. A blog... called Why You Suck that would become a cultural phenomenon. And so when we meet Leo Palamino, he is a romantic dreamer, a dedicated writer, a dishwasher in a tourist trap, and a celebrity... A man famous for his flaws. Then one afternoon, as the very dejected Leo watches Julie being interviewed on a talk show about her upcoming book, he lays eyes on the woman of his (impossible) dreams... COLETTE is on her way into a wedding across the street from Leo's house. Her wedding.
