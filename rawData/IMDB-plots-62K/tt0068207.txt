The young but travelled Ana arrives in a manor in the countryside of Spain to work as nanny of three girls and finds a dysfunctional family: the matriarch is a sick old woman obsessed by death and having constant nervous breakdowns; her son Jos√© was raised dressing in girl's clothes until his First Communion and is obsessed by military clothes and paraphernalia; Juan, the father of the three girls, a pervert since his childhood, writes pornographic letters to Ana; his wife, Luchy, has suicidal tendencies; and the mystic and religious eremite Fernando, who was inflicted to flagellation in his childhood, lives as a recluse in a cave. The presence of Ana disturbs the three brothers with tragic consequences.
