An amnesiac youth tries to piece together his past, but what he discovers may jeopardize his future.
Barney Snow (Wood) wakes up in a hospital with no memories but his name &amp; recurring images of a car crash. With little else to go on, he makes the place his temporary home and soon learns that all of the other residents in this youth clinic are dying from terminal illnesses - except him. When another patient, Mazzo (Perrino), asks Barney to play host for his visiting twin sister Cassie (Cook), the two strike up a fast friendship that blooms into romance and promises a fresh start for Barney. But as he gradually pieces together his fragmented memory, he begins to unravel the puzzle of his strange dreams and remember his old life. How will Barney react once he learns the truth about his own past, and what will he do when Mazzo surprises him with a difficult request for help?
