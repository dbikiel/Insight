So White flees from the wicked Queenie, wins over the thugs from Murder Inc. and meets her overrated Prince Chawmin'.
Spoof of 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)' with an all-black cartoon cast. Many WWII references, including rationing (the evil Queen is a hoarder of sugar and rubber tires) and Jeep vehicles (the Sebben Dwarfs come to the rescue in three of them). Also spoofs the extreme close-up of Kane's lips uttering "Rosebud" in 'Citizen Kane (1941)'.
Coal Black is working as a maid in Harlem, but her mistress doesn't like the idea that Prince Charming is more interested in the maid than in her, so she pays some crooks to drive her to the country and kill her. But Coal Black is lucky, she isn't killed, but set free somewhere in the rural area - near a US Army Training camp. Seven GIs take care of her, but her old mistress finds out that she's still alive, and comes to poison her with candy. Only a kiss of her lover can save her now...
