A dishonest used car salesman decides to become the salesman that God wants him to be - with surprising results.
Jay Austin, a dishonest car salesman in lots of debt, comes to a turning point in his life where he becomes a born-again Christian, turns from his dishonest way of business and begins trusting in God to take care of him. Even when things get hard he trusts God, and God provides him with a way to pay off his debt honestly.
Jay Austin wants to sell you a car, and it doesn't matter to him how he does it. He is dishonest in his business, and that's exactly how he conducts his personal life as well. He is dishonest in all of his relationships - even his wife and son know they can't trust him. However, as Jay works on restoring a classic 1958 Triumph TR3A convertible, he comes face-to-face with the reality that his life is spinning out of control because of the choices he has made and the way he has conducted himself in his business and in his relationships. He resolves to give his life and his business over to God and make God the "Boss," and begins the ride of his life! Despite the fact that selling cars at honest prices may cause him to loose his business (as it would have been a struggle even at the dishonest prices he had been selling cars), he decides that he is going to be honest in all of his dealings. He gives the business over to God and says that it is His car lot and He can do with it as He pleases. If the business goes under, then it is because God allowed it; if the business succeeds it will be because God saved it... all he desires is to finish well by honoring God with the way he conducts his business, and indeed to honor God in all of his relationships.
