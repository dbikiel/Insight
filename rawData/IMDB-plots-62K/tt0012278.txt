A drifter at an amusement park finds himself both the bodyguard and hit man of a man targeted by a criminal gang.
Buster is thrown off a train near an amusement park. There he gets a job in a shooting gallery run by the Blinking Buzzards mob. Ordered to kill a businessman, he winds up protecting the man and his daughter by outfitting their home with trick devices.
After landing in an unknown town in the middle of nowhere, our hero, Buster, finds an advertisement for an expert shooting gallery attendant from a borrowed newspaper. With a stone-cold face and a loaded revolver, Buster manages to land a job at Tiny Tim's gallery--an innocent front for the secret criminal society known only as the Blinking Buzzards. Now, Buster has a death contract to take care of, and on top of that, a new employee who wants to hire him as a bodyguard. Can Buster be in two places at once?
