An English woman and her daughter enlist the aid of a cowboy to try and get their hardy hornless bull to mate with the longhorns of Texas, but have to overcome greedy criminals and the natural elements.
When her husband dies en route to America, Martha Price and her daughter Hilary are left to carry out his dream: the introduction of Hereford cattle into the American West. They enlist Sam "Bulldog" Burnett in their efforts to transport their lone bull, a Hereford named Vindicator, to a breeder in Texas, but the trail is fraught with danger, and even Burnett doubts the survival potential of this "rare breed" of cattle.
Headstrong widow Martha Price and her daughter with their prize bull travel from England to Texas to sell their bull. Along the way, a drifter, Sam Burnett, helps them on their journey and is tempted to scam them out of their bull. But his growing attraction to Martha, and his conscience helps him clear a safe passage for Martha and her daughter.
