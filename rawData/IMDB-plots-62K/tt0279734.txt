A nostalgic and compelling look into the legendary three camera, three projector process that revolutionized motion pictures and led the industry into the widescreen era. Through actual Cinerama clips, rare behind the scenes footage and new interviews, CINERAMA ADVENTURE takes the viewer back to a lost era of movie showmanship, placing this American cinema phenomenon into historical perspective.
This full-length documentary looks at the birth - and death - of the Cinerama wide-screen film process. By the early 1950s, attendance at movie theaters had dropped dramatically, mainly due to the widespread adoption of television. Cinerama was the brainchild of Fred Waller who had been working on what was to become Cinerama for many years. It was an ultra-wide screen format that used three projectors to show the film and gave viewers a sense of inclusion in the film. Film-goers loved the format but film-makers and actors found the process unwieldy and difficult to work with. It was also quite expensive. Only a few films were produced in the format although it led major studios to develop their own wide-screen processes.
