Lonely rider Speedy Gonzales (Spede Pasanen) arrives to small town of New York to revenge the murder of his brother. Who shot Moses Gonzales? Was it the dishonest sheriff (Leo Jokela), mysterious Bat Masterson (Ville-Veikko Salminen), ladies' man tsai-jai-jai-Manolito (Esko Salminen) or maybe bank robber Clyde (Pertti Melasniemi). Slowest shooter of HÃ¤me (Simo Salminen) it hardly could have been.
