A man looks to find a way to escape the criminal ways of his outlaw family.
Living as pariahs on the outskirts of Gloucestershire, three generations of Cutlers, the infamous family of professional criminals, spend their time planning the next heist and mocking the Police. Under Colby's wing, the family's patriarch, the one who pulls all the strings and the source of all evil, Chad the eldest son, finds himself wavering from his desire to live a quiet life with his wife and son away from crime and his fearful respect to his father. When Colby devises a plan targeting Lord Lieutenant's inestimable private collection of art, the Police will come after them hard and a life of bad decisions, violence and crime will begin to collapse, underlining the fact that Chad, his father's worthy son and heir needs to make his decisions fast. Will he attempt to oppose and break up the family, or will he spread wings and begin to live his new life? After all, you've only got one family..
