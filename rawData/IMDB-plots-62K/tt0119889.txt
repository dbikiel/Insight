Gory remake of the Gaston Leroux classic story, only this time, the phantom is not disfigured, but a man who was raised by rats deep under the Paris Opera House.
Standard story of the Phantom does have one major variation - The phantom is not a disfigured individual, but rather is an unwashed orphan abandoned in the sewers under the Paris Opera &amp; raised by rats. The Phantom invokes death upon anyone who dares harm his beloved rats. In fact, The Phantom's nemesis is the chief exterminator who develops a rat-catching machine.
In Paris 1877, rats save a baby from death and raise him in the underground of the Opera de Paris. This child becomes The Phantom of the Opera, a half-human half-animal breed, who falls in love with Christine Daa√©, an opera singer just beginning her career. He fights for her love against the aristocratic Baron Raoul De Chagny, though Christine loves them both equally.
