Rebellious teenager Stevie finds his mother's gun, and along with his girlfriend impulsively decides to rob a bank. The pair find themselves in over their heads as they take hostages and the FBI negotiates Stevie's absurd demands.
Two teens impulsively decide to rob a bank, a la Bonnie and Clyde. Quickly they find themselves in over their heads as they are forced to take a bank full of hostages and the FBI are at the door. Hostages include a heroin addicted Gulf War vet, the pesky bank manager, a gruff old man, a calm bank employee, and a helpful young woman. The head FBI man must sort through the psychology of all the participants to try to keep the events from escalating. Underlying in all of this is the pure adolescence of the two who initiate the trouble.
