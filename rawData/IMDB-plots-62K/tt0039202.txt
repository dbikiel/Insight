When Blondie has an opportunity to become a star the Bumstead household, mainly Dagwood, becomes upset.
Dagwood falls foul of George M. Radcliffe even before he knows he's the new boss. After he manages to put a big deal in jeopardy he's in real trouble, and Blondie has the bright idea of having Radcliffe round for dinner. Maybe also inviting the feisty new schoolteacher to make up the foursome wasn't so bright though.
Dagwood's new boss, and already at odds with Dagwood for various and sundry reasons, is trying to find a lot suitable as a building site for a big plant which he has contracted to build. When he finds it, the owner is an orphan and refuses to sell it. The owner is also a school-mate friend of Alexander, and this puts more pressure on Dagwood....and Blondie, who can handle it.
