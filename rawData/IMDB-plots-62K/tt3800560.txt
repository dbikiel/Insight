The emotional journeys of two women victimized by corruption and injustice in Mexico and of the love, dignity and resistance that allowed them to survive.
Two women, a voyage in two voices, which, like reflections of a single echo, convey what fear means in the life of a human being. Highways, landscapes, gazes. Mexico from north to south in an era when violence has taken control of our lives, our desires and our dreams. An emotional and evocative journey, steeped not only in loss and pain, but also love, dignity and resistance.
