Welcome to the future. Civilization has been obliterated by natural catastrophes and global economic collapse. In the rotting skeletons of once great cities, the remnants of mankind struggle to survive under the brutal reign of vicious warlords who rule by fear and the power of the fist. The only hope for a courageous band of street urchins is the brave fighter Jonas, the last surviving keeper of the secrets of an ancient martial arts dynasty. Jonas must challenge the heartless Bosco in a fight for freedom or death ... only then can he become master of mankind's destiny.
The World has become a lawless place. Anarch rules the streets, and warlords take power by brute force. The streets are ruled by warlords. One warlord is Bosco, a ruthless killer who is obsessed with perfecting his power through martial arts. Together with Cleo, Boscos lascivious partner, he kills Master Thach, keeper of a sacred book of marital arts.
