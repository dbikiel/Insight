In the mid-60s, a teenage 4.0 high-school student is drawn out of his element on a dare by his peers, to become a dancer on popular TV music show.
A young man of the rock and roll generation is in his senior year of high school. When one day he successfully gets on a popular teen dance television show he becomes a star. The plot follows him as he lives his new life in his new world. What he finds are adoring fans, jealous rivals, bitter friends left behind, and the girl of his dreams...his dance partner.
It's 1965 Philadelphia. Perry Parker's Dance Party, a locally produced television show featuring the day's hit parade, is popular amongst teenagers. The dancers on the show are known as the in-crowd, which in reality is a vacuous and cutthroat world of individual popularity. On-screen/off-screen couple Vicky and Dugan are the most popular dancers on the show, and the fantasy of many of those watching from home. One of those at-home viewers is "good boy" honor student Del Green. Although knowing nothing about how to act in the in-crowd, Del manages to sneak onto the set and dance with Vicky in place of an absent Dugan. Perry and the show's producers like the way Del and Vicky look together, as do many viewers. Perry sees Del's appearance as a Godsend which he thinks is enough to boost the show's sagging ratings. He tries to manufacture an off-screen romance between the two to match the on-screen romance. Dugan may have something to say about this matter. With the show, Del sees a different side of what's going on, including with Vicky. He also has to learn how to deal with his new found fame, which is alienating his old and true friends, especially his oldest friend and next door neighbor, Gail Goran. With all these changes in his life, Del has to decide what is truly important.
