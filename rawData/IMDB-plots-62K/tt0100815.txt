Olivier Rohan, a young doctor, has just opened a general practice. However, having only a small clientele, he continues to work in the hospital's emergency room. One night, he will witness the unnatural death of a young man.
Dr. Roussel (Jean-Pierre Bacri) is one of the handful of French doctors who earns really outstanding compensation. Dr. Olivier Rohan (Stephane Freiss) has just finished qualifying in his specialty (cardiology) and is one of the vast number of young doctors who don't earn very much at all. He has just entered into private practice but is happy to earn a few extra dollars by filling in for Dr. Roussel in answering nighttime emergencies at the local hospital. However, his first emergency puts him squarely into the middle of a dicey political situation with the ultra-right-wing Nouvelle France party. When he becomes aware of the extent of medical corruption and collusion with the political system, he is horrified.
