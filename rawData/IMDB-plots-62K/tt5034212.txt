4 university students hook up to a machine allowing them to become one of their fellow students - e.g. allowing them each to party as one of the rich and beautiful. The long hook-ups start seriously affecting their normal selves.
Incontrol follows a group of university students who discover a device that allows them to take control of others, and experience the world through someone else. As they push the machine's abilities to its limits, they begin to question the device itself.
