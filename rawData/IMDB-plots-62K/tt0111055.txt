As she grows up, Alia (the daughter of housemaid Khedija) learns the secrets of the peaceful palace where she and her mother live.
Set in 1950s Tunisia, a 25-year-old woman, Alia, returns to her place of birth-a prince's palace in which her mother, Khedija, worked as a house servant and mistress of prince Sid' Ali. She had fled the palace ten years earlier, at which time she spent burying tortured memories of her childhood. In her visit to pay respects for the death of the prince, she wanders through the largely abandoned palace where she is confronted by these memories represented as detailed flashbacks of her childhood. She begins to piece together a narrative about her mother's sexuality and sexual exploitation in a space ordered by gender and class difference, and is re-awakened to her persistent questioning about her father's identity. As she negotiates her past, she also deals with her current relationship to her lover, Lotfi, who has asked her to have another abortion. Her development throughout the film contrasts her awakening to a past of sexual and social servitude which many of the female servants experienced in the palace against her own contested independence fraught with pain, conflict and uncertainty.
Undereducated but wised up by time, Khedija (Amel Hedhili) is a typical strong woman who strives to live the life's burden.This beautiful housemaid (good at belly dancing and comes from some unclear lineage--something not uncommon among the poors who live in a culture in which people are commonly traded) has a daughter, Alia (Hend Sabri/Ghalia Lacroix).She realizes that her irressistable appeal to men, besides giving her some welfare and security insurance, one too many times tends to invite troubles--something she always wishes will never happen to Alia.With the setting of 1950's Tunisia (when the French's backed-up monarch almost comes to an end), the story take us to see the world from Alia's eyes: the childhood with all its joys and unprejudiced free spirit, adolescence with its sensitivities and curiousities, up to when she reaches adulthood--the time when life dares her to choose her own destiny.
