Police Lieut. Candella, longtime friend of the Rome family, walks a tightrope in the case of cop-killer Martin Rome.
Petty crook and cop-killer Martin Rome, in bad shape from wounds in the hospital prison ward, still refuses to help slimy lawyer Niles clear his client by confessing to another crime. Police Lt. Candella must check Niles' allegation; a friend of the Rome family, he walks a tightrope between sentiment and cynicism. When Martin fears Candella will implicate his girlfriend Teena, he'll do anything to protect her. How many others will he drag down to disaster with him?
In New York, when the cop killer Martin Rome arrives in the hospital badly wounded, the lawyer W.A. Niles unsuccessfully tries to convince him to confess the robbery of a collection of jewels and the death of the owner. Along the night, Martin's girlfriend Teena Riconti sneaks and visits him. Later Niles threatens Martin telling that he would catch Teena to force her to assume the other crime. When Martin escapes from the hospital, Lieutenant Candella, who is an old friend of the Rome family, investigates the case and has to chase Martin.
Basically the story of two tenement-bred, Italian-American, childhood-friends who grow up with radically different views on crime, and are pitted against each other while following their chosen paths: Gangster Martin Rome is seriously wounded during a gun-battle in which he has killed a policeman, while Police Lieutenant-Detective Candella, of the homicide squad, is seeking the solution to another murder in which he suspects Rome may have been involved. Rome is taken to a prison hospital, but he escapes and murders again in an attempt to protect a girl who was innocently involved in some of his crimes. From there, the detective tries to track down Rome, and attempt to shatter the artificial illusions or hero worship on the part of Rome's younger brother.
