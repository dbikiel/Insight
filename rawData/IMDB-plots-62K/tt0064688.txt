An international car rally across Europe is complicated by smuggling, cheating, love at first sight, etc. etc.
In an international car rally, competitors must travel from various points in Europe to Monte Carlo, then race their cars. Things are complicated by smuggling, cheating, honor, inventions, medicine, and love at first sight...
The story is based on the Monte Carlo Rally, first raced in 1911, and the film recalls this general era, set in the 1920s. The epic car rally across Europe involves a lot of eccentric characters from all over the world who will stop at nothing to win.
