Iska, Karolína, and Vendula are eighteen-year-old girls who have just graduated from high school. Not wanting to let go of their carefree student lives or their friendship, they plan to hitchhike to Holland, where they've arranged to work on a farm for three months. But Vojta, Iska's little brother and her father's right hand man, joins the trio against their will. He becomes a witness as well as a catalyst for the breakup of their friendship - for the girls recognize that time cannot be stopped. Dolls is a story about searching for love and finding oneself in the volatile time of late adolescence.
A group of adolescent girls and young brother of one of them hitch-hike in an adventurous quest in summer weather through the Czech landscape. The trip is a part of their psychological maturation. The key protagonist (played by Marie Dolezalová) unsuccessfully attempts to overcome or firmly suppress her intense erotic attraction to women. In the first part of the film, she vehemently denies her orientation when queried in this respect by a more experienced, more mature, and overtly lesbian lady. She experiences intense frustrations in her intra-psychic struggle, even attempts suicide, but remains kind to her friends even when these contemplate rejecting her after detecting her erotic preference. These other girls in her group also struggle with growing up pains and with adolescent impulsivity and self-doubts. The film reflects their adolescent search for a fulfilling friendship and for a more satisfactory definition of one-self. The film culminates when the protagonist (Marie Dolezalová) finally again encounters and befriends the more mature and overtly lesbian lady and develops a stronger self-acceptance.
