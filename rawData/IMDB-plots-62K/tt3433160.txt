"MAGICIANS follows four world-class magicians on stage and off, exploring how and why these characters so passionately dedicate their lives to the craft of illusion. Their journey takes us from the most humbling of road gigs to grand performances on the biggest of stages, from finding love to terrible personal loss; and to the prospect of losing everything for a dream others don't understand. As we come to understand why each is obsessively chasing his own dream, we'll discover the unhidden secret: far more fascinating than the magic are the magicians themselves."
