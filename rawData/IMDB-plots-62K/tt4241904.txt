Two people meet just after their previous relationships have imploded, so in an effort to make themselves more appealing, they exaggerate, fib and outright lie, and after they move in together all the deception unravels.
A contemporary comedy about two people who meet just as their previous relationships have imploded in ugly fashion. In a desperate bid to reboot their romantic fortunes, they play fast and loose with the facts and ignore more red flags than you'd see in a Chinese Army parade in order to start something fresh with each other. Then, just 10 days into their new lives, the jig is up and the wheels start coming off the love wagon in hilarious and surprising ways.
