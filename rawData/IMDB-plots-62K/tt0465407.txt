A young girl discovers she can communicate with dolphins.
Alyssa is a troubled 14-year old, suspended from school a year after her mother has drowned. Her grandmother Lucy, at wit's end, decides to take Alyssa to her father, James, whom Alyssa thought was dead for years. He studies dolphin communication at Smith's Point, on the Grand Bahama Island. James has not known of Alyssa's existence and is clueless about parenthood. The women arrive at the same time that James may lose his research operation to a tourist attraction. Father, daughter, dolphins, and town are on a collision course. Alyssa and James get encouragement from James's girlfriend and her father. It's the dolphins who can teach, and Alyssa who discovers how to listen.
Fourteen year old Alyssa (Carly Schroeder) has been living with her Grandmother (Katharine Ross) since the death of her mother a year ago. Troubled and lost, her grandmother decides she should go to the Bahamas to live with the father she never knew she had. Caught in the difficult realization of having a father, coupled with the adjustment to island culture, she seeks refuge in the discovery of the astonishing gift she has for communicating with dolphins. But when the powers-that-be threaten to close down her father's dolphin research facility, it is Alyssa and her wild cetacean friend who hold the key.
