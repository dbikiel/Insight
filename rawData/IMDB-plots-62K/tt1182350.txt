Sally's parents' marriage breaks up when her father undergoes a mid-life crisis and impulsively weds a prostitute. Meanwhile, Sally's own marriage also begins to disintegrate.
Follows a pair of married couples, Alfie (Sir Anthony Hopkins) and Helena (Gemma Jones), and their daughter Sally (Naomi Watts) and husband Roy (Josh Brolin), as their passions, ambitions, and anxieties lead them into trouble and out of their minds. After Alfie leaves Helena to pursue his lost youth and a free-spirited call girl named Charmaine (Lucy Punch), Helena abandons rationality and surrenders her life to the loopy advice of a charlatan fortune teller. Unhappy in her marriage, Sally develops a crush on her handsome art gallery owner boss, Greg (Antonio Banderas), while Roy, an author nervously awaiting the response to his latest manuscript, becomes moonstruck over Dia (Freida Pinto), a mystery woman who catches his gaze through a nearby window.
In London, Helena Shebritch (Gemma Jones) has a broken heart since her husband Alfie (Sir Anthony Hopkins) had had a third age crisis and left her seeking his lost youth. She meets the charlatan fortune teller Cristal Delgiorno (Pauline Collins) and follows her esoteric advices believing in the power of prophecy. Alfie meets the younger call girl Charmaine Foxx (Lucy Punch) and proposes to her. Meanwhile, their daughter Sally Channing (Naomi Watts) has financial difficulties with her husband and aspirant writer Roy Channing (Josh Brolin). Roy has graduated from medical school, but has never worked as a doctor since he had written a successful first novel and decided to follow the career of writer, but he never succeeds in writing a good second novel. Sally starts working in the Geller Gallery and has a crush on her handsome boss Greg (Antonio Banderas), while Roy peeps and flirts through the window with his neighbor Dia (Freida Pinto), who is always dressed in red. When Roy's poker friend Henry Strangler (Ewen Bremner), who had written a magnificent novel and showed only to Roy, has a fatal car accident with their other poker friend Mike, Roy misunderstands that Strangler died and he steals his manuscript which is successfully accepted by the editor to be published. Their lives change when Helena meets a widower that is her twin soul and Alfie finds that he is a cuckold and Charmaine is pregnant. Roy and Sally split, and Sally, who had fantasized an affair with her boss, finds that Greg sees her as a co-worker and friend only. Further, her mother will no longer lend a large amount to her to open her own gallery following Cristal's advice. And Roy, who moved to Dia's apartment, finds that Strangler has not died, but is in coma instead.
In London, two marriages in crisis are presented. The first, which has already ended, is the forty year marriage of Alfie (Sir Anthony Hopkins) and Helena Shipridge (Gemma Jones). Alfie, who is going through a post-mid-life crisis, still sees himself as a young man, while he only sees Helena getting older. The second, which is slowly disintegrating, is the relatively young marriage in comparison of the Shipridges' daughter, Sally Channing (Naomi Watts), and her American author husband Ray Channing (Josh Brolin), their problems largely stemming from Ray's seeming inability to live up to the potential of his first novel, while earning a true wage to support him and Sally. With the Shipridges, Alfie only envisioned a new, energetic life with at least a young at heart partner. His life ends up being nothing as he suspects, that is until he meets Charmaine (Lucy Punch). However, he may not be able to see in Charmaine what the rest of the world sees in her. Helena knows that her life as she knew it is over with the divorce. She changes her tune when she starts seeing Cristal (Pauline Collins), a psychic who only seems to see positive things for her future, while only seeing the worst for Ray, who Cristal knows Helena does not like. With the Channings, their marital problems are only exacerbated by Helena's constant unannounced visits, she who seemingly needs not only to fill them in on any of Cristal's latest news of her/their life/lives, but drink them out of house and home. Ray, who has a medical degree, knows that he will never return to medicine as a career, despite the writing being stalled, and the time needed for the writing impinging on his ability to do any other work. The only thing that seems to give him any pleasure is watching the exotic young woman Dia (Freida Pinto) in red in a window across the courtyard. But he may sense fate is watching out for him with some tragic news, and Sally has returned to work putting her art history background to use in working in the art gallery owned by Greg Clemente (Antonio Banderas). This employee status is far away from what was her original professional dream of owning her own gallery, which she was planning on opening when Ray made his writing fortune. But Sally slowly begins to realize that the more her marriage seems to be deteriorating, the more she desires married Greg. As each of Alfie, Helena, Ray, and Sally pursue their dreams and desires, the illusion may be more palatable than reality.
