Gary Tarn's remarkable, award-winning documentary, BLACK SUN, investigates this through the story of Hugues de Montalembert, a New York-based artist and filmmaker who was blinded by a vicious attack in 1978.
In 1978, Hughes de Montalembert, a French filmmaker and painter living in New York City, was attacked by two men on the way back to his apartment. During the struggle, paint thinner was thrown into his eyes by one of his assailants, scarring and blinding him for the rest of his life. For many, the story would have ended right there. For Hughes, it was just the beginning.Eighteen months after being blinded, Hughes began to travel the world -- alone.This movie chronicles his story and travels as a blind man alone in the far corners of the world. Hughes narrates how he re-experiences reality minus his sense of sight, and how he rediscovered the world and human nature through his other four senses. Filmmaker Gary Tarn, provides a collage of 16mm visual imagery as backdrop for Hughes narrative.
