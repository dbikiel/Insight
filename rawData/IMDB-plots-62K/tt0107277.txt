Josh and Sam are two brothers facing change, their mother is about to marry a French accountant and the kids are sent to go live with their father in Florida. Meanwhile Josh tells Sam that he is a "S.A.M." that is going to be sent to Africa to fight in a war and that Canada is a safe haven for any S.A.M. unwilling to fight. The cross-country journey begins when the 2 boys think they killed a drunk and steal his car en route to Canada where they encounter The Liberty Maid. Will Josh &amp; S.A.M. make it to Canada or will they wish they should have never left home.
Brothers Josh and Sam are fed up with life at home - not to mention each other, so Sam becomes friends with his father's step sons and Josh feels left out. This means war! Josh uses his creative talents to make Sam believe he's a genetically altered mutant trained to fight in battle. So their plot to run away from home is disguised as a covert operation to get Sam to Canada so he doesn't have to fight in a war in Africa. Along the way, they take the car of a drunk who tries to kill them, and meet up with Alison, who Josh tells Sam is the Liberty Maid who can help them get to Canada. On the run from cops and other people, Josh and Sam realize life at home was better.
