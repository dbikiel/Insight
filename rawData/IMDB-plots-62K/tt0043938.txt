When Susan Gilvray reports a prowler outside her house police officer Webb Garwood investigates and sparks fly. If only her husband wasn't in the way.
In a fancy suburb in California, the gorgeous housewife Susan Gilvray finds a prowler outside her house late one night and she calls the police. Officer Webb Garwood and his partner answer the call but do not find anyone. Later Webb returns to Susan's house with the pretext of checking if everything is OK. Susan invites him in to have coffee with her. Webb soon learns that Susan is married to John Gilvray, a middle-aged broadcaster of a late night radio show. They also discover that they are from the same hometown. Webb makes a pass at Susan and even though she tries to put him off they soon start a love affair. When John becomes suspicious Susan ends her relationship with Webb. Though difficult Webb stays away from Susan. Without Susan's knowledge Webb plots a scheme to get rid of John; he simulates a scenario where John is "accidently" shot dead. There is an inquest and it is ruled that John Gilvray's death was not intentional. Webb quits the police-force a job he was never happy doing. He manipulates John's brother to get close to Susan again. He learns that John could not have children and that John and Susan's marriage was not perfect. Webb meets Susan and convinces her that he is really innocent.  They resume their relationship and soon marry. On their wedding night, Susan discloses that she is four months pregnant. How can they explain the baby coming so soon after they marry when there was supposedly nothing between them four months ago? There was a great deal of publicity around the case someone is bound to put it all together.
