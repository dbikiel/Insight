"Starfish" tells the story of a couple whose love is tested to its limit after their perfect life falls apart in a single moment.
Based on the real story of Tom and Nicola Ray from Rutland. Their perfect life is totally ruined in a single moment after Tom had developed sepsis. While her husband was in coma, Nicola gave birth to their second child on the other side of the same hospital. Within a matter of days, sepsis would rob Tom of both his arms and legs, and left his face severely disfigured. As an ordinary man, Tom never put himself at risk -- he just woke up two months later in a nightmare, a face-off quadruple amputee. This incredible story of survival shows what can be overcome when love is unconditional.
