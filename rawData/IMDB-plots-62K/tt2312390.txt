When Cass (Brian Lewis) sets his eye on scoring a date with Natalie (Trin Miller), one of the world's top Romance of the Nine Empires players, she issues him a challenge: to show that he's gamer enough to win this year's national championship. Determined to prove that he can win any game, Cass enlists his long-suffering game buddy, Leo (Scott C. Brown) to teach him everything he needs to know about collectible card games. But The Legacy, a group of hardcore gamers with an evil plan, has raised an army of the undead to win the game for themselves.
