A documentary portrait that takes us into Jonathan Gold's universe to tell the improbable story of a revolution inspired by the pen, but driven by the palate.
CITY OF GOLD is about the transformative power of food and food writing in how we experience where we live. Pulitzer Prize winning critic, Jonathan Gold, is our VIrgilian guide, casting his light upon a vibrant and growing cultural movement, a movement in which he plays the dual roles of high-low priest and culinary geographer of his beloved Los Angeles.
