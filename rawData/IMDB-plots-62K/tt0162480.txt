A slacker (Akshay Kumar) must impress a wealthy man to marry her daughter (Juhi Chawla).
When his astrologer uncle (Satish Kaushik) predicts a favorable future for Raja (Akshay Kumar), he decides to nothing until the prediction comes true. When he meets Shalu (Juhi Chawla) the daughter of a millionaire (Kadar Khan) he decides his predicted future has arrived. However his lazy lifestyle does not meet with his future father-in-law's standards, and he insists that Raja does some hard work for a change.
Badrinath would like his daughter, Shalu, to marry someone who is capable of standing on his own two feet, without having to depend on his wealth and the money left behind by his ancestors. When Shalu falls in love with a slacker and con-man named Raja, Badrinath is beyond himself, and puts a condition that Raja can only marry her after he accumulates a sum of rupees one lakh, or else he will get Shalu married to someone else. Desperate to prove himself to his future father-in-law, Raja concocts several schemes to get rich enough to marry Shalu - with hilarious results.
