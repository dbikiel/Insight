The popular Dr Kilmore is sacked after being discovered in a compromising position on the roof of the nurses' home. The patients are determined not to lose him, and so take on the might of the "cutting" Dr Tinkle and the overpowering Matron.
Francis Bigger, 'preacher and healer', ends up in hospital in this chaotic Carry-on medical movie. With Dr. Kilmore in trouble, Matron refuses to support him after the amorous attentions she has fed Dr. Tinkle have paid off. There's a humorous but slight role for Charles Hawtrey suffering from a sympathetic pregnancy and the film closes with the patients revenge on Dr. Tinkle and the formidable Matron because of their conspiracy against Dr. Kilmore.
