The discovery of life on Mars places a robotic expedition and a manned mission in a race to the Red Planet. On the way we discover that love - biological, spiritual, and even mechanical - can flourish in all kinds of ways.
After landing on Mars, mission control wants Charlie to be the first "American man" to set foot on the planet. Charlie defers that honor to Casey after which he announces he is still the first "man" to set foot on Mars.
