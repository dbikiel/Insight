An idealistic young man returns to the plantation where he grew up in servitude. He brings his fianc√©e Lutiebelle, but hopes to convince the plantation owner that she is really his cousin to secure the family inheritance. Aiding the comic complications are his family members Missy and Gitlow and the plantation owner's endearing but ineffectual son Charlie.
