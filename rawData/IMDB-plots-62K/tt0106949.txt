We follow 4 classmates in a strict boys' secondary school in 1950s Copenhagen, where a sadistic teacher torments his students. We meet them again at their 35 year class reunion.
At their 25th high-school anniversary some bourgeois citizens remember their time in school as a happy one. In reality it was quite the contrary. The school was a madhouse in which the teachers, especially Blomme, tormented the students. As a result one of them became a murderer.
