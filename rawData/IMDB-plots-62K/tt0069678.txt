Annabella marries Soranzo, when she is pregnant by her brother Giovanni. Destiny, and jealousies will expose her past, and Soranzo broods revenge. But he is not alone in that - and death will unite all.
In an amoral home, where a man lives in sin with a woman, his daughter and his son fall in love, and have incestuous relations even after the young woman marrys. Her husband will seek revenge, and a gory end will unite all in classic tragedy - death. (Based on John Ford's play, "Pity she's a whore", respecting its poetic text, and careful Italian Renaissance settings.)
