When a man's wife dies in an accident, his children return home to deal with the tragedy together.
Minor Mishaps is the story of a family in which family relations are put to the test after the mother dies. It is a collective tale in which we follow the lives of the four leads: 1) John, the father, who has a serious heart condition but risks his life by sticking to his job as a hospital porter; 2) Tom, his son, who is in the process of losing his wife and children because his career as a building contractor overshadows everything else; 3) Eva, the elder daughter, trying to make her way as an artist but "scared shitless" whenever she faces a blank canvas; and 4) Marianne, the younger daughter, who gets a new job running the staff canteen at an accountancy partnership and despite her inexperienced, awkward behavior initiates an affair with a colleague. All four try to find themselves and one another, and all four learn that families aren't something you choose, but something you just have.
