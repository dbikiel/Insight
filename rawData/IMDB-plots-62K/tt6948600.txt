When a kid, Jeremy, suddenly says everything he thinks out loud.
Teenage boy Jeremy has a basic teen life. That is, until he tries on some Virtual Reality goggles at the mall. After that day, he starts saying everything that comes to his mind. From saying not the nicest thing to someone, or completely humiliating yourself, he's probably said it. As a resolution, he and his sister Victoria attempt to make his mouth speak for himself, and not his mind.
