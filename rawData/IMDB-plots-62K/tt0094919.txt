Eggs of the small, furry alien carnivores are left behind on Earth and, after hatching, again set their appetites on the town of Grover's Bend.
A batch of unhatched critter eggs are mistaken for Easter eggs by the country-folk inhabitants of Grover's Bend and, before long, the ferocious furballs are on the rampage again.
The flesh-eating fur-balls from outer space are back for a second outing and this time its an even bigger problem as the nearby community of Grovers Bend become the latest course! It's just as well those bounty-hunting hero's are back to save the day! But as the residents are already dropping by the mouthful, it seems as if this time the critters have won. Too bad!
Over two years after the events of the first film, Brad Brown (Scott Grimes) is now 15, and returns to Grovers Bend to spend Easter Weekend with his Grandma. Leftover Krite eggs that were in Brad's old farm are taken and mistaken for Easter eggs, unleashing the Krites onto the entire town. Luckily, Ug, Lee and the former drunk Charlie (Don Keith Opper), return from space to help Brad, the now retired Sheriff Harv (Barry Corben), Brad's crush Megan (Lianne Curtis) and the rest of the town fight the Krites once again.
