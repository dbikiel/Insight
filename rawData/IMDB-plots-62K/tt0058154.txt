Shot by a jealous husband, Charley falls out a porthole and is lost at sea only to find himself returned as an attractive blond woman. His best friend is staying at his house as he puts Charlie's affairs in order and after being convinced, finds himself an unwilling helper in Charlie's new plan to marry into money.
George Tracy and Charlie Sorel, both thirty-six years of age, are writers - a Paris novelist and Hollywood screenwriter, respectively - best friends, and partners in crime in skirt chasing. Charlie is shot dead aboard a yacht during a party by filmmaker Sir Leopold Sartori after he catches Charlie fooling around with his wife, Rusty, Charlie's body which falls overboard and which is not found. Sartori's act is despite he being a notorious womanizer himself. Charlie's sparsely attended funeral service, at which George provides the eulogy, demonstrates how Charlie's womanizing ways negatively affected his so called friendships. Staying at Charlie's Malibu beach house, George meets a beautiful young woman who seems to be suffering from amnesia, but is drawn to Charlie's house. George initially believes she is one of Charlie's conquests, but she eventually comes to the realization and is able to convince George that she is Charlie reincarnated. George ultimately believes it is God's divine retribution for Charlie to come back as an object of his own derision. But together and individually, George and Charlie have to devise a way for Charlie to live in this new female body, George who has no money to support Charlie, and Charlie's estate which is bankrupt. In addition, Charlie, who has always been a player, figures that she should be able to capitalize on her new womanhood, which includes using knowledge of her former indiscretions as a man, and getting back at Sir Leo. But she may also be able to eke out a lucrative life as she becomes the object of affection of wealthy momma's boy, Bruce Minton III.
