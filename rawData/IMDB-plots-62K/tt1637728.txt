A groundbreaking device is designed to glimpse alternate universes. But when the machine malfunctions and transports a group of observers into a nightmarish dimension of alien terrors, the travelers must use ingenuity to survive.
In the Federal Science Institute, Dr. Jillian O'Hara and her assistant Brian Murphy will demonstrate their research to a commission led by the arrogant Senator Jackson Crenshaw and Dr. Karen Fast from the president office expecting to keep the budget of her laboratory. Colonel Sam Synn is responsible for the security with Lieutenant Rivers and Pvt. Jordan Reid. Dr. O'Hara explains that her machine is the fruit of a long research initiated by her father and can show parallel dimensions. During the demonstration, there is a problem in the device and the room is transported to another dimension with everybody that is observing the experiment. Soon the survivors discover that the room is placed in the wilderness of a dangerous dimension inhabited with wild beasts.
