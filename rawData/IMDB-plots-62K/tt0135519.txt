Instead of success in the Greek province, two poor portable barrel piano players stumble upon an affluent but desperate runaway girl, intent on escaping a much-despised arranged marriage. Will they forsake their beliefs for money's sake?
Two poor portable barrel piano players ramble through the Greek countryside and play in fairs. They meet by chance with a rich runaway girl whose father offers a large reward to her finders. They have to choose between getting the reward or helping the girl with her renegade love affair.
To seek a better future--and, hopefully, a bigger and more generous audience--the poor portable barrel piano players, Pavlaras and Petrakis, leave Athens to attend an open fair somewhere in the rugged Greek province. However, instead of success, the two compassionate artists will stumble upon Keti--an affluent but desperate runaway girl--intent on escaping a much-despised arranged marriage. Keti's father offers a tempting and totally gratifying reward to anyone who finds the young fugitive; nevertheless, will Pavlaras and Petrakis forsake their beliefs for the sake of money?
