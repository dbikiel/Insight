Desperate to pay the bills and come through for their loved ones, three lifelong pals risk it all by embarking on a daring bid to knock off the very bank that absconded with their money.
Three seniors, who have been wronged by the company they worked for thirty years and are living social security check to check, decide they have had enough. So, they plan to rob the bank that is taking their pension money. Joe Harding (Sir Michael Caine), a man who lives with his daughter and granddaughter, who which he has a strong relationship with is having troubles with his mortgage. Willy Davis (Morgan Freeman), lives very far away from the only family he has but needs desperate kidney surgery. Albert Gardner (Alan Arkin), a grumpy old man who a long time ago used to play the saxophone and is constantly flirting with the grandmother of his student. The problem is, they don't even know how to handle a gun.
Toiling away for more than three decades at the drab Wechsler Steel Company, the octogenarian best friends, Joe, Albert, and Willie, see their world turn upside down, when the firm's pension fund evaporates after a soulless corporate merger. At the end of his tether, penniless, and having less than twenty days before he loses his home, Joe has a flash of insight: the inconspicuous ringleader needs to orchestrate the perfect bank heist, and steal back his pension from the very institution that's robbing them of what is rightfully theirs--Brooklyn's despicable Williamsburg Savings Bank. Now, the game is afoot. Is it too late to right the wrongs, and go out with a bang?
