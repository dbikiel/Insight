According to the will of an eccentric millionaire, one of four randomly chosen strangers will become his heir if he/she can double $5000 by honest means.
A dying millionaire instructs his lawyers to drop twenty-five purses containing a $100 bill on the streets of New York City. Four honest 'finders' return them to the lawyers. Under the terms of the will, each of them is given $5,000, and the first one to double that money within 30 days will receive the entire estate: $1,000,000. However, the greedy relatives cut from the will are determined to thwart each one's plans.
