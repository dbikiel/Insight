Morgana is a Mexican transgender opera singer with a dream: a sex reassignment surgery. We follow her odyssey all the way to Bangkok as she fights for the identity she has been struggling all her life to construct.
Morgana is a transgender soprano with a relentless determination to fight against social stigma and family prejudice to the attainment of a universal milestone, the self-assertion of herself as a human being with dignity socially recognized. To this end, she embarks on an odyssey with lights and shadows to try to build an identity persecuted throughout her life, an identity made in Bangkok.
