A hawker demonstrates his glue's exceptional qualities; however, a pair of policemen shut him down. Bent on revenge, he goes to extreme lengths for justice, but it's a risky action, and one could easily get a taste of his own medicine.
At a small and quiet corner of an empty street, an honest and enterprising hawker gives a small demonstration of his amazing universal glue's exceptional qualities, from his rickety stall with the rough wooden sign that simply read "The Best Glue". Soon, a small and willing-to-buy crowd assemble in front of his outdoor business; however, a pair of ever-watchful police officers rush to shut him down, scaring off the customers. Bent on revenge, the wronged vendor will go to extreme lengths for justice, but it's a risky action, and one could easily get a taste of his own medicine.
A peddler of "the best glue" sets up his outdoor stall. A crowd gathers for a demonstration. As he gives his pitch, two observant cops decide drive off his customers and close him down, much to his fury. He seeks revenge as they sit on a park bench. Incensed, they give chase to administer frontier justice. The crowd, with a mob's psyche, cheers on whomever is on top. It's a pity because this glue really does work.
