'Bharat' is a journey of a man and a nation together. At the cusp of India's birth as an independent nation, a family makes an arduous journey to freedom. However, this freedom comes at a cost. An eight-year-old boy, Bharat, makes a promise to his father that he will keep his family together no matter what--a promise that he keeps over the next 60 years of his life, despite each decade throwing a new set of challenges at him--some humorous, some thrilling, some romantic, and some life-threatening. His resilience, loyalty and a never dying spirit mirror the fundamental qualities of our nation--Bharat. Interestingly, the movie is an official adaptation of Korean film 'An Ode to My Father (2014), which depicted modern Korean history from the 1950s to the present day through the life of an ordinary man.
During the Partition of India in 1947, a young man is separated from his father in the promise that he will protect their family and lead the household. A young boy Bharat joins the The Great Russian Circus in 1964 and further joins the Indian migration to the Gulf territory during the discovery of oil in the region during the 70's. He falls in love with the chief engineer and also leads the immigrated group of Indians to justice. Throughout his life spanning from 18 to 70 years of age, he struggles to keep his father's promise and holds the family together.
