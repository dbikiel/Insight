"And the rain is still going on and on, as usual!" Said the Little Fox sadly. "This is a warm rain - mushroom. After it, the whole forest will be in the mushrooms, "- said the Papa Fox. "And does the strawberry rain happen?" Asked the Pup: "I love strawberries so much!" "Everything happens," said the Papa Fox. Little Fox ran to his friends. The Hedgehog said: "The mushroom rain is mine!". The Crow continued: "And mine - is cheesy. That would be a cheese rain. ". The Hare ran up: "And for me - carrot. But where can you get it? " The Pup: "From the carrot cloud. Oh, if I could fly, I would have trembled for everyone. " The Raven gave the Fox its wings, and he flew.
