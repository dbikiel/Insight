Wendy (Marla Sokoloff) is left a struggling winery in her father's will. While learning to manage it, she must contend with a cunning competitor and her feelings for his son.
When Napa valley wine estate 'Chateau Meroux' owner jerry dies, he leaves it all unexpectedly to his long-estranged, presumably neglected daughter Wendy, who totally depends on her San Francisco roommate Jennifer. They visit it, and soon fall in love with Chris, the son and initially spy of rival neighbor and candidate-buyer Nathan, viz. Romario, the romantic assistant of ambition-consumed French wine-maker Francois. When Wendy decides to stay and run it, despite scary debts, Chris actually helps them, but Nathan stops at nothing.
The Chateau Meroux follows Wendy (Marla Sokoloff) and her best friend Jennifer (Amanda Righetti) from San Francisco to the Northern California countryside after Wendy inherits a beautiful but struggling winery from her estranged father. Formerly a happy-go-lucky young woman, Wendy must quickly decide whether she wants to keep the vineyard and attempt to turn it around - or sell it to Nathan (Christopher Lloyd), her unscrupulous competitor down the road who will stop at nothing to acquire the Chateau.
