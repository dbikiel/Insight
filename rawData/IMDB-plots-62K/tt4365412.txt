Following the first ever Somali bandy team in their struggle to reach the World Championship in Siberia 2014. The team lives and trains in Borlänge, Sweden and is coached by legendary, former bandy player Per Fosshaug and Cia Embretsen.

A group of young male Somalis get together to form the first Somali bandy team, as a way of integrating into society. Aided by entrepreneur Patrik Andersson and coached by bandy star Pelle Fosshaug they begin by learning of basics of using ice skates with the ambition of playing for Somalia in the World Championships in Irkutsk, Russia. There are many problems that must be solved before the team members have their ticket to the championships. And how do you explain bandy to relatives back home in Somalia?
