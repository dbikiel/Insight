Mandy was born deaf and has been mute for all of her life. Her parents believe she is able to speak if she can only be taught and so enrol her with a special teacher.
Born deaf, and in time becoming dumb, this is the life of Mandy, a child whose parents have mixed feelings as how to maintain her future, that is until mother and daughter meet the ever-enthusiastic Searle.
