A tennis champion falls in with the Hollywood crowd. He soon finds himself being corrupted by the life in the fast lane.
Franklin Cane is a red-hot professional tennis player who climbs the ladder of success with his trainer, Jonathan, at his side. Jonathan was once considered the greatest American tennis player and intends to guide Franklin to the high-road. Franklin does not transcend the interest he has in local Hollywood-type parties littered with has-beens, wannabes and think-they-ares. It is there that he meets Cynthia, a pretty photographer who makes a living photographing people like French filmmaker Jean Renoir and taking production photos of commercials. Cane becomes slowly seduced by the fast-track life and, when Jonathan suddenly passes away in his sleep, he succumbs to a lifestyle that is completely devoid of morality. He drops off Cynthia at the side of the road, so to speak, and continues driving to a bleak, uncertain future.
