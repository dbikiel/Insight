In a trial, one of the jurors makes the jury change their mind as new evidences are found:Camille helps save defendant Natalie from the "eleven angry men".
Natalie stands trial:she has killed (by accident) her lover, a rich kid whose father wants to avenge.The judge and the jurors seem to have a thing about this "bad " girl whose dad was a deserter and who has already had four lovers.But one of the jurors makes the jury change their mind as new evidences are found:Camille helps save the defendant from the "eleven angry men". Natalie is released ,but she cannot find a job.So the ex-juror ,who owns a cycle shop ,hires her but his family will ignore who she really is.Of course Camille's son falls in love with the girl but his soon-to-be brother-in-law has nastier plans about her.
