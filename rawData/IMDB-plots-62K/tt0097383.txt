Docudrama about the life of St-Francis of Assisi.
The life of St. Francis of Assisi (1181-1226) as related by followers who gather after his death to tell stories so that Leone can record them: a privileged and virile youth, a prisoner of war, an heir who turns away from his father and gives all to the poor, a beggar for others, and an inspiration to friends who accept the Gospels' life of poverty. He seeks the Pope's blessing, and he endures persecution at the hands of the family of Chiara Offreduccio (1194-1253), who becomes St. Clare. Many join the order he has established and then rebel at his expectations. In near despair - and ill - he writes a Rule to take to the Pope; then, the Lord sends him a message. He dies smiling.
in flashback, the film relates Francis of Assisi' evolution from rich
man's son to religious humanitarian and eventually to full-fledged
saint. Francesco was based on Herman Hesse's Francis of Assisi,
which director Liliana Cavani had previously filmed in 1966. The Saint
and founder of the Franciscan Order of Friars Minor is played by
Mickey Rourke and his inspiration, the woman who later became
Saint Clare is played by Helena Bonham Carter. Raised as the
pampered son of a merchant, Francis goes off to war, only to return
with a profound horror for the society which generated such
suffering. In one scene, as an act of renunciation, he strips himself of
his fine clothing in front of his father, and leaves the house naked
and barefoot, joining the lepers an beggars in the poor section of
town. The film follows with a series of episodes from the saint's life
rather than a coherent narrative follows, up until his final days when
he receives the stigmata, or wounds similar to those on the body of
Jesus at the crucifixion.
