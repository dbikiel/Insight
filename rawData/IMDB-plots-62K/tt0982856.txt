Animated Film based on Ray Bradbury's novel "The Martian Chronicles", on the short story called "There Will Come Soft Rains..."
On the morning of December 31, 2026, the robot sets the table and calls for breakfast the whole family - father, mother, two children and grandmother. None of them are already alive - after a global catastrophe, only a handful of ashes remained in the grandmother's beds and armchair. However, the robot continues to function as before - it announces that it is time to go to work and school, and in the evening prepares a festive turkey and congratulates everyone on the new year 2027.
