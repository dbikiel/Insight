The final installment of the "Hunting Trilogy" once again has Elmer out hunting, while Bugs and Daffy try to con him into shooting the other.
In this, the third and final installment of the Bugs/Daffy/Elmer "hunting" trilogy begun in "Rabbit Fire", we see Daffy uttering such phrases as "Well, I guess I'm the goat" and "Brother, am I a pigeon", and Bugs holds up signs telling Elmer it's the appropriate season(s) in question.
