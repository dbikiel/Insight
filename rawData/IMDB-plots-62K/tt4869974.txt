A couple of friends decide to have a party in Amsterdam but things get a little bit out of hand. This is the Dutch version of Project X.
When popular college kid Max is about to get thrown out of school because he might not gain straight A's on his exams, he calls in the help of his long lost Ã¼ber-nerd friend Ruben. Together with the comedic help of "chick-magnet" and Marroccon street hustler Youseff, they decide to throw the biggest exams-party ever dreamt possible. Fissa quickly got labeled as the Dutch version of Project X.
