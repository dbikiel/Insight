Donald is listening to a radio cooking program while mixing up a batch of waffles. But he's distracted and uses rubber cement instead of baking powder.
Donald is listening to a radio cooking program and mixes up a batch of waffles, but he's distracted and uses rubber cement instead of baking powder. The batter proves to be unusually stiff... His spoon gets stuck, and the batter acts like a rubber-band airplane, flying the bowl around the room. Next, Donald gets his head stuck into the batter (and his tail in the waffle iron). He tries to chop it with an ax; the ax flies up and splits the room in half. He throws the bowl out the door; it sticks to the knob and finds its way back in.
