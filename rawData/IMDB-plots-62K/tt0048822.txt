When an aspiring barber becomes inadvertently involved in the theft of a valuable diamond, necessity forces him to masquerade as a 12 year-old child - with humorous consequences.
Wilbur is a young man whose dream is to become a great barber, but for now, he's working just as an assistant, at a hotel's barber shop. When one day he gets involved (by mistake) in some big robbery, he is forced to disguise himself as a 12 year old boy, so that he can get away from his persecutor.
