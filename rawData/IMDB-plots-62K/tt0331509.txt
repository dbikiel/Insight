Boy genius Michael Dean (Adkins) teams up with a super-talented chimpanzee and his caretaker (Modine) to take down an animal testing lab. In exchange the scientist gives the boy some pointers on the girl of his dreams.
This amusing, darkly comic tale follows CIA agent Jack McCall and a chimpanzee that he attempts to liberate from a testing lab. Named Clemens, the chimp has been trained in martial arts combat, as part of a program designed to turn the creatures into fearsome fighting machines. Naturally this leads to plenty of slapstick moments between Modine and the chimp, especially when they seek refuge in the home of a boy and his mother as the owners of the lab hotfoot it after the escaped primate.
When former American football player and CIA-martial arts instructor Alec McCall finds out the dodgy firm Z.I.T. he's been giving martial arts training to chimpanzee Clemens for is going to abuse him (and other test animals), he steals him and disappears south, where they meet Michael Dean, an exceptionally intelligent schoolboy who just accepted tutoring the football jocks for the team uniform he hopes to impress girls with. Gratefull he and his ma took them in after a mate failed to get Clemens into a zoo there, McCall takes the fatherless kid under his wing. When Michaels ma helps Alec decipher the ZIT-files he grabbed on his way out and the firms goons send to retrieve the chimp track him down, a grim fight becomes inevitable.
