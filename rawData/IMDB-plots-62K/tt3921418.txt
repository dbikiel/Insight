Arthouse comedy set in 1992-3 following awkward graduate students on vacations all around the world.
L for Leisure is a comedy following a group of graduate students across 10 vacations in 1992 - 3 all around the world as they embark on a series of minor adventures: athletic, chemical, cultural and sexual. With a low-fi 16mm style that recalls 90s television, home videos and underground comic books, L FOR LEISURE is a unique piece of deeply independent filmmaking, reveling in excesses of both lush beauty and awkward humor.
