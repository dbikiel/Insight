After suffering humiliation by the crew Invincible, street dancer Ash (Hentschel) looks to gather the best dancers from around the world for a rematch.
Beaten by his rival Invincible's hip-hop crew and ridiculed as 'Popcorn boy', Ash seeks revenge at the annual international street dance championship in Paris. He travels trough Europe to gather an exceptionally talented crew. In Paris, he meets in her overprotective uncle-guardian Manu's bar and wants Latin dancer Eva. They agree to attempt a fusion with hip-hop, introducing Latin pair dancing, and become lovers. A week before the tournament, Ash gets cold feet, all seems lost.
