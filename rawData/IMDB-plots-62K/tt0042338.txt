Gun salesman Steve Farrell gets two of his new Colt .45 pistols stolen from him by ruthless killer Jason Brett and vows to recover them as Brett and his gang leave behind wake of robbery and murder throughout the territory. When Farrell recovers a stagecoach carrying gold and brings it back to town, he is made a deputy but unknown to him the sheriff is on league with the outlaws as is Paul and Beth Donovan, an apparently clean-cut young couple with ambitions for quick wealth. Although the town members are apathetic toward helping Steve, he gets plenty of assistance from Walking Bear, an Indian chief grateful that Steve saved his life.
