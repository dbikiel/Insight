Wes, a socially awkward teen, is on an imaginative journey of sexual discovery. He forms an unlikely (and not entirely healthy) friendship with Dusty, an older man who writes erotica for a pulp magazine. Wes doesn't have a clear roadmap of where he wants his journey to take him. Ultimately, his destination isn't really where he wants to be.
