Abandoned by his father at an early age, Jim MacLaine (David Essex) seems to have inherited the old man's restlessness. Despite his apparent intelligence, Jim decides not to take the exams that would pave his way to university. He lives, for a time, a life consisting of dead-end jobs and meaningless sex, before returning home to work in his mother's shop. But still he can't settle down. He begins to think that the life of a pop musician might be the thing for him.
