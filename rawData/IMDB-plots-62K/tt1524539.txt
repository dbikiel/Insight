In 1913 India's cinema industry is born from Dadasaheb Phalke's efforts to make Raja Harishchandra (1913), India's first feature-length B&amp;W silent film.
Dadasaheb Phalke had abandoned a well established printing business after a quarrel with his business partner. He gave his word to the worried partner that he would never enter into the printing business again as competition! Phalke got instantly unemployed and workless. The family was struggling to survive. One day he accidentally stumbled across a tent theatre that was screening a silent motion picture. He was awestruck with the film. The idea of film making struck him. Along with his hardworking wife and two enthusiastic kids by his side, he ventured into a field unknown to contemporary India. Making of India's first feature film, 'Raja Harishchandra' was an amazing adventure. The Phalke family encountered mostly funny but also a few grave situations during their journey of film making. They were a team of crazy yet lovable people that helped in winning over patrons and eventually money. Together, not only did they deliver the first Indian film, but they had ensured it to become the first super hit film too! In 1914, Phalke refused offers from his English friends to make films in London. His reason for the refusal was - 'I must keep making films in India, so that it gets established as an industry at home'. The rest is history.
Dadasaheb Phalke in an effort to escape from an acquaintance, accidentally stumbles upon cinema and is eventually smitten by it. He shares his passion for cinema with his endearing family, wife and 2 sons who are equally attracted to cinema. Much to the ridicule of the his surrounding society, this fascination of his drives him to learn the making of motion picture, culminating with a visit to London. He eventually sells almost all of his material possessions in his strife to make India's first motion picture.
