A 38-year old former chef starts all over again when he interviews for entry-level corporate jobs--and can't get one.
After losing his restaurant, chef CLAY MAGUIRE must start his career all over--at the bottom. Pushing forty with no "corporate skill-set", Clay enters the strange world of the Unemployable Interviewees of America. He soon meets others who share his plight--LIZ, who spent her youth traveling in the Peace Corp and now finds that experience digging wells in Bangladesh isn't exactly what corporate America is clamoring for; BOB a manufacturing engineer who lost his pension when the company went bust and now finds that 64 is too old to get hired as an administrative assistant and too young for a Wal-Mart greeter; and CHARLIE, who's job as a corporate hiring manager is so miserable that he only hires interviewees he hates because working at his company should be a form of punishment. Spurred along by the total lack of encouragement by his job counselor SAM, the self-serving "wisdom" of his homeless buddy NICK, and the most bizarre series of job interviews imaginable, Clay and his fellow job-seekers strive for dignity, success, or at least a job taking customer service calls from prison inmates for minimum wage. A hilarious, insightful look at job interviews, finding the courage to start all over, and life at the ENTRY LEVEL.
