The platonic friendship between two high school youths is explored through the attempts to get the girl an abortion. Her young male friend offers his support and tries to find her a doctor. She is grateful, but has trouble in expressing her thanks. At times funny, at other times touching, this is a refreshing, uncommon look at teenage friendship.
