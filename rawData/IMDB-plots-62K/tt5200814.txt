Three college friends are passionate for music and face difficulties for their common dream.
The story is about friendship of three friends born out of shared experiences, passion for music and aspiration for fame. The film is also a reflection of the current dichotomy that exists in society where we talk of free will but readily accept conformity. Parents impose restrictions and dictate terms, because they love their children but at times don't understand them.
