Tennessee Sheriff Buford Pusser attempts to stop a moonshiner whose bad liquor has blinded several teens.
Bufford Pusser is the Sheriff of a Tennessee County who must go against a former friend, and a group of women who use an old blue law to segregate a recently freed prostitute. To fight them he uses other old laws that aren't relevant today. Is he ready to face opposition, or will there be any?
