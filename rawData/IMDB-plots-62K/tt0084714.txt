A rootless young man's drawn into an unnamed religious cult by a beautiful girl. Every moment with the group causes him to become increasingly under the control of the cult's leader. After his parents fail in their attempt, they hire someone who has experience, kidnapPing, and then 'de-programming' - undoing the mental damage - which had been done to him.
