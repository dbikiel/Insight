In a squalid apartment in Berlin, an unconventional director strives to capture unadulterated feelings, raw passion and undiluted sex for an experimental film project about love.
A huge, run-down apartment in Berlin Mitte. Two women and a man, rehearsals for a movie about love and sex, that will never be shot. Acting and reality mingle into a dangerous melange. Berlin is the shelter, love is impossible, flesh is the law.
Encased in a drab and squalid apartment stripped of furniture somewhere in Berlin, two unknown actors Hans and Marie, under the guidance of Nina, an unconventional and aspiring director, strive to capture unadulterated feelings, raw passion and undiluted sex for an experimental film about love. For this reason, the project lacks a script and a title, and while the actors deliberately stay in the dark, during the following week, Nina for the sake of pure cinematic realism, will push everyone's boundaries in a low-budget exploration of intimate desires and suppressed emotions, as the fine line between drama and reality eventually begins to fray. In front of the camera's harsh truth, authenticity is hard to counterfeit, nevertheless, will Nina's film project ultimately reach completion?
