Impersonal but beautiful images of Akerman's life in New York are combined with letters from her loving but manipulative mother, read by Akerman herself.
Chantal Akerman, the Belgian filmmaker, lives in New York. Filmed images of the City are accompanied by the texts of Chantal Akerman's loving but manipulative mother back home in Brussels. The City comes more and more to the front while the words of the mother, read by Akerman herself, gradually fade away.
From her adopted home of New York City, francophone Belgian filmmaker Chantal Akerman reads letters written to her by her Brussels-based mother on behalf of herself, "Daddy, (Chantal's younger sister) Silviane, and the whole family." The readings are set against extended moving images of New York City generally presenting a feeling of isolation in the images being stark in their overall context, as even when masses of people are presented, there is little interaction between them. Adding to the starkness is a sense of monotony, whether it be any collection of objects moving at one speed, or any background noise almost acting like white noise. Although there is an outward loving tone to the letters themselves, they also convey a sense of loneliness on Mme. Akerman's part, not only in the messages themselves, but the rather innocuous nature of the letters which are remarkably similar over time with only the "names" and specific details changed. The closing extended image may provide an omen that Mme. Akerman may get her ultimate wish with regard to Chantal in relation to the family in Brussels.
