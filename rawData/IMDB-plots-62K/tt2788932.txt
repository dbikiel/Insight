Nikita Khrushchev said in the early 60s that he would cancel the money, which would show the last thief on TV. This is shown in the movie "The Last Thief". The protagonist, a criminal in the past, has been freed, and goes into a bright, communist future, where there is no place for the bourgeois economy and the thieves' instinct. He is shocked. What can be stolen if everything is free? He feels completely out of this society.
