An ex-convict is tracked down by his estranged teenage son, and the pair try to build a relationship and life together in Seattle.
After leaving jail, Jack Kelson wants to live a normal life. He rents a small flat, moves in with his son Nick and tries to get a steady job. But then a former friend steps into his life again.
Jack Nelson has left the jail after being condemned by a series of bank robberies. He has decided to fix his life and meets Nick, his adolescent son. But Jack has a serious problem with alcohol, which causes him to behave awful with Nick. Nick's mother died years ago and Jack has terrible memories about her. The boy doesn't go to school, so he has to work selling papers. Meanwhile, Jack works in a bank, cleaning the windows. He has musician skills playing the ukulele and tries to earn some money playing in the street. A police detective keeps watching Jack, because of his parole. Jack's dream is run away to Alaska and work there as a fisherman. However, there will be several problems for him and Nick, like an old robber partner that keeps looking for Jack in order to commit another crime, and his alcoholism. But Jack will discover that he really loves Nick, who's hanging out with his pretty neighbor, a problem girl with a prostitute mother. Jack's love for Nick will be the force that will help him to reach his dreams and keep away from problems.
Jack Kelson is released after some years in jail and gets reunited with his only son Nick. Nick's mother is long dead, so he goes to live with his father, who is now trying to stay away from trouble (and prison). So, Jack gets a job as a window cleaner and tries to teach Nick not to repeat his mistakes. Their dream is to get away to Alaska, but things won't be easy for them...
