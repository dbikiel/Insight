A marshal goes up against a collection of vicious outlaws terrorizing his town.
During the gold-rush days, Tom Horn is jailed for an assay office holdup at Gold City, after he loses his money and horse to cardsharp Blackie. Tom escapes with cell-mate Morgan, when the latter's men, Mingo, Red and Curly, rescue him from the jail. Mingo, and most of the gang, dislike Tom and they have lean times until Tom, using Morgan's gun, robs the Blue Goose Mining Company, where Julie works. The gang hides out in a ghost town from where they rob a train, and Tom saves Morgan's life. Tom and Julie become sweethearts, and he promises her wealth and a trip to San Francisco. But the gang begins to unravel.
