A woman who struggles in relationships doesn't find the love she wants. Until a much younger man appears, but she's not convinced yet.
Rose is beautiful, fun, successful and in her early thirties. Whenever she begins to dream of a wedding, she gets dumped. On top of that she gets invited to the weddings of her exes and her bestfriend. To not let them know her feelings, she takes her younger trainee Daan to all the ceremonies. She gets caught in embarrassing situations and promptly falls in love with the charms of an attractive doctor. People have said: 'From a wedding comes a wedding', but is he her Mr Right, the one she will say 'yes I do' to?
