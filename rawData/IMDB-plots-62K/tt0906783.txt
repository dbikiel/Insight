Twenty-seven is more than just a number. It is a lifetime.
Eliot is the surviving member of the rock band Finn after his bandmate and best friend Tom commits suicide a week after his 27th birthday. With the help of small-town boy Three Words, and a young Irish hitchhiker, Eliot travels in a drug-enhanced stupor from LA to his home town Joplin, Missouri to carry out Tom's last request.
