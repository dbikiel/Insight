Pluto wants to sing along with the birds, bee and cricket, but he is tone deaf.
The birds are singing, the bees buzzing, and the crickets chirping. Pluto wants to join in this glorious music, but he's tone deaf. He finds his way to a music store while the owner is at lunch, and discovers that his tail can be used like the stylus of a record player; he returns home with a plan equipped with a crooner record, he soon has every dog in the neighborhood swooning.
