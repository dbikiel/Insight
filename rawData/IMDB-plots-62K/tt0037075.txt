Stephen Neale has just been released from an asylum during World War 2 in England when he stumbles on a deadly Nazi spy plot by accident, and tries to stop it.
Stephen Neale is released into WWII England after two years in an asylum, but it doesn't seem so sane outside either. On his way back to London to rejoin civilization, he stumbles across a murderous spy ring and doesn't quite know who to turn to.
During World War II Stephen Neale is released into society after having spent two years in a mental hospital. Before heading to London, he stops at the village fÃªte where he wins a large cake. It's clear that something valuable was in the cake as it is forcibly taken from him on the train. He's certain that something, perhaps a crime, occurred and begins an investigation. He comes to believe that there is a Nazi spy ring at work but has difficulty getting anyone to believe him.
