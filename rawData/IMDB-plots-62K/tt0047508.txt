Three sailors on leave (Joe, Al and Davy) head for Paris with one thing on their minds. Joe pursues chanteuse Colette D'Avril who proves to be more than she appears; Davy is pursued by sexy cashier Yvonne; but the blonde Al rescues from a purse snatcher rewards him with kisses, then vanishes without telling him her name. Romantic complications and resolutions follow in true musical comedy fashion.
