In post-WW2 Europe, when the dictator of a small police state dies during surgery, the operating surgeon, who's a visiting American doctor, is held captive in order to preserve the terrible state secret.
Visiting in England, famed American surgeon Doctor John Marlowe is decoyed to a middle European country, and discovers the operation he is to perform is on the Vosnian dictator. When the latter dies, he is replaced by a look-alike, but Marlowe is the object of a shoot-to-kill, vicious pursuit by the secret police of Vosnia since it is vital to Vosnia that the dictator's death does not become known. Fleeing, he seeks help from an English-speaking actress, Lisa Robinson, and the two are harried across the countryside before being captured. (Produced by the British team of Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat "in association with London Films" and released in the U.S. by Columbia Pictures Corporation.)
Dr. John Marlowe, an American surgeon, is contacted by the authorities of Vosnia, an Eastern European country. They ask him to operate on General Niva, the president dictator. The physician accepts the deal and performs the operation. Unfortunately Niva dies and the government, unwilling to let the people know about it, replaces Niva by a lookalike. Marlowe has now become a man who knows too much...
