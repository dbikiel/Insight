Stig-Helmer takes another vacation with his Norwegian friend Ole. This time it's time for a skiing vacation in the Alps. Of course, Stig-Helmer has never learned downhill skiing, but he attends a ski school. And together they manage to charm two women also on vacation. The other Swedish tourists are a diverse group of people, including the choleric Mr. JÃ¶nsson and his family and two men trying to sell kick sleds.
