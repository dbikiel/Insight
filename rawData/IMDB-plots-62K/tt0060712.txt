Completely topless! Completely uninhibited! The wayout craze that began in San Francisco is now exploding across the USA and Europe. National publications have documented the "Topless", but nowhere has it been as thoroughly covered (or uncovered) as it is in Russ Meyer's rampaging motion picture Mondo Topless. The film is believably real - but "unbelievable" just barely describes all of Meyer's discotheque discoveries! Fantastic women, fantastic dances - the "buxotics" - in an incendiary tribute to unrestrained female anatomy featuring the world's loveliest bosom brigade!
