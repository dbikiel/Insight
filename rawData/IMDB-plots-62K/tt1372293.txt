On the night Barack Obama was elected our 44th President, more than 58 million voters cast their ballots for John McCain. Journalist/filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi presents this first-person, cross-country snapshot of a group of conservative Americans who saw their hopes and dreams evaporate in the wake of the decisive Democratic victory in the 2008 Presidential election. Filmed in the months leading up to that historic event, Pelosi gives a voice to these voters, once labeled 'the silent majority,' and explores their feelings about a changing America in which they live.
