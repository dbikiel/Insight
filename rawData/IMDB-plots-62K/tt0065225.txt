Gold bullion worth USD 1 billion has been stolen from a hijacked train in Denmark. The main suspect is Count Massimo Contini. The US government sends Matt Helm, one of its top agents, to investigate and recover the gold.
The count has stolen enough gold to cause a financial crisis in the world markets so I.C.E. sends in ace spy Matt Helm to stop him. As Matt works alone, the British send in Freya to aid Matt, but it seems that Freya causes more problems than she solves.
Count Contini masterminds the theft of $1 billion in U.S. gold being transported in Europe. This will cause gyrations in the world's financial markets, and Contini will profit from it. ICE chief MacDonald summons Matt Helm, "busy" photographing women models. MacDonald, in effect, makes Matt a Judas Goat, exposing his cover and encouraging Contini to make a move against Matt. The ICE agent will deal with Contini's former lover, current lover, a British woman agent, and Contini's lovely Asian operative before the final showdown with the Count.
After a daring and well-orchestrated train heist, the evil criminal mastermind, Count Massimo Contini, manages to get his hands on $1 billion in gold bullion, intent on collapsing the international stock market and the world's economy. Under those pressing circumstances, the easygoing playboy and U.S. counter-espionage agent, Matt Helm, has forty-eight hours to retrieve the gold, starting from Denmark. However, there, Matt's maladroit guide--the beautiful travel agent, Freya Carlson--does more harm than good, as the suave count's army of henchmen is hell-bent on thwarting his plans. Will Matt's state-of-the-art gadgets and his unique MiniCopter help him save the day?
