Bite Size tells the stories of 4 kids around the country as they embark on a journey to become healthier and lose weight. All it takes is someone to believe in you and the will to try.
Bite Size is a feature documentary that takes an intimate look at the obesity epidemic through the eyes of the children most at risk, following several kids, families, and educators across the country. They show us that losing weight is not just about changing the number on the scale but also about asking ourselves who we are and what we want to become. The film presents a new perspective on this critical issue that transcends the data and statistics we hear every day, asking us to consider the consequences of our actions and legacy that we intend to leave for our children.
