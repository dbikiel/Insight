Three miles north of Molkom, hidden deep in the lakeside forests of Sweden, lies Ã„ngsbacka, a 21st Century playground for adults. Once a year, their gates open to a thousand international participants, placed in "Sharing Groups" at random. A Swedish celebrity, a Californian hippie, a Finnish grandmother and a backpacking Australian rugby coach, who stumbled on the wrong party, are amongst the group that take us on an unforgettably quirky, two-week emotional rollercoaster. Firewalking, shamanism, tantric sex and a myriad other physical, psychological and esoteric experiences guide our unlikely heroes towards enlightment, love, loathing and themselves. Will they ever be the same again?
