A group of models find themselves trapped in a factory inhabited by a cannibalistic degenerated family.
Kati is a young model on her way to a birthday party for her little sister Celine. Tanja, Kati's best friend, and other friends want to celebrate and camp near the woods. While preparing the party, the girls get attacked by strangers. Kati, still on the way to the camping place, loses her way in the woods and is led on to the wrong track by a vagabond. When her car is stolen afterwards, Kati finds herself lost in the deep forest and arrives at an old factory, where a clan of cannibals is already preparing their feast's main course - Kati's friends.
