The Mountain Tears' follows the odyssey of a guild of stonemasons during the troublesome first years of the twentieth century. Far from their homeland, hunted, cut off by war and battles, slowly or quickly, they will perish one by one, and only Markos, the master builder, like another Ulysses, will continue his wandering.
