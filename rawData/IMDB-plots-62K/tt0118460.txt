A recovering alcoholic must wrestle with demons within and without when he and his family move into a haunted hotel as caretakers.
Television adaptation of Stephen King novel that follows a recovering alcoholic professor. He ends up taking a job as a winter caretaker for a remote Colorado hotel which he seeks as an opportunity to finish a piece of work. With his wife and son with him, the caretaker settles in, only to see visions of the hotel's long deceased employees and guests. With evil intentions, they manipulate him into his dark side which takes a toll on him and his family.
As well-meaning as he is, ex-school teacher, writer, and former alcoholic Jack Torrance just can't catch a break. When he gets a job as winter caretaker for the Overlook Hotel, a secluded resort in the Colorado Rockies, he thinks it's a way to get his life back on track. He and his wife, Wendy, and son, Danny, will be the only people in the Overlook the entire winter. Everything seems to be going well at first. After the snow falls, however, Jack finds that they really aren't alone. Danny's precognitive power, his Shining, unlocks a dormant evil in the hotel and it preys on the entire family - through Jack.
