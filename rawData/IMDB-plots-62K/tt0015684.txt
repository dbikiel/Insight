Elizabeth Cheney has a wealthy husband, social prominence and everything she could want in life . . . except Ted Lutton, the man she loves. Now, she must decide whether to give up everything and everyone to follow her heart in The Circle. At a time when divorce means a lifetime of banishment from family, friends and society--foregoing a life of ease for a life of hardship--Lady Elizabeth (Eleanor Boardman) wants to leave her husband, Arnold (Creighton Hale), for their friend Ted Lutton (Malcolm McGregor). To help convince herself to stay with her husband, she invites Arnold's mother, Lady Catherine (Eugenie Besserer), who left Arnold's father for Lord Porteous (George Fawcett). Everything that Elizabeth sees confirms her belief that she should forgo love and stay with her husband . . . until she witnesses the true love still shared by this couple living in social exile.
An unhappy woman considers leaving her dull husband for another man. Based on a play by W. Somerset Maugham.
