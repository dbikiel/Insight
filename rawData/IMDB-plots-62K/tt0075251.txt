A notorious secret society known as Spermula plans to return from the future and conquer Earth by neutering the male population.
This refers to the original French film, "L'Amour est un fleuve en Russie" [Love is a River in Russia]- a superior film to the English dubbed "Spermula" which is more widely known. English subtitles are available that make this film more accessible. Plot: In the 1930's, a notorious secret society known as Spermula - centered around the "rapture of being" achieved through a total liberation of the senses - disappeared from "civilized society." They were rumored to have developed supernatural powers. Over time they have honed their powers, and put in motion a plan to return from the future and conquer the world that once exiled them. An elite force of commandos - in the guise of several beautiful females - are charged with the task of neutering the male population. This is to be achieved by extracting the male reproductive fluids (orally) - allowing the decadent human race to eventually die off from natural attrition. Ingrid (Dayle Haddon), leading the Spermulan assault, sets about neutralizing the leaders of the community in which they have established the invasion's beachhead ... and then plans to gobble up the rest of the male population in one lavish orgiastic party. Unfortunately, as Ingrid herself has foreseen, members of her cadre begin to succumb to the unfamiliar temptations of the flesh, and develop emotional attachments to their intended victims. Blighted by the curse of emotional love, the invaders are forced to withdraw ... for now. [Note: the English-dubbed "Spermula" was significantly re-written in the dubbing, invoking a hokey plot about the planet Spermula about to be destroyed in a giant collision, prompting the decision to invade Earth.]
