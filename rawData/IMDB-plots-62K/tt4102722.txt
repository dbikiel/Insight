Three inept night watchmen, aided by a young rookie and a fearless tabloid journalist, fight an epic battle to save their lives. A mistaken warehouse delivery unleashes a horde of hungry vampires, and these unlikely heroes must not only save themselves but also stop the scourge that threatens to take over the city of Baltimore.
Baltimore's beloved Blimpo the Clown and his troupe all die mysteriously while on tour in Romania. Meanwhile, back in the States at Baltimore Gazette's newspaper building, a motley crew of clumsy and amateurish night watchmen are assigned with the easy task of watching a misplaced delivery of a wooden coffin. Before long, the overnight shift will be spiced up with a multitude of bloodsuckers who're determined to break every law in the guard's handbook. Ultimately, with the building crawling with the vampires, the watchmen will need to man up to save the day, and in the process, send the departed back to the afterlife.
