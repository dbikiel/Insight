A cocky German fighter pilot is shot down over England in 1940 and makes numerous attempts to escape to fight again.
This is the true story of Oberleutnant Franz von Werra, the only German prisoner of war to escape from imprisonment in Britain during the Second World War.
Shot down over England, Cocky Oberleutenant Franz von Werra is interrogated by army intelligence. His dossier shows the boastful von Werra is a media hero in Germany for a daring dogfight over Britain in which he claims to have shot down several English planes and destroyed more on the ground. The British know the action never took place and the story is false, a lie by the egotistical flyer who craved the celebrity and acclaim the fabricated action gave him. Confronted with the truth, von Werra displays only bravado, claiming that he will escape within six months. He spends the rest of his captivity trying to do just that.
