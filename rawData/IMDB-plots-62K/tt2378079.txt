Unexpectedly, a young fighter, active member of a radical and violent neo-Nazi group finds true love, and with it, a new purpose in life.
Scorpion in Love is an urban fable that tells us the story of Julián, a young man who with his best friend Luis participates actively in a group of violent neonazis leaded by a fanatic man called Solís. Julian begins to train in a boxing gym and slowly sees how the discipline of this sport and the goodness of his trainer start changing him. But when he falls in love with Alyssa and his redemption is near, Luis and the rest of the pack will return to stop him from leaving behind his nazi past.
Poisoned by a fierce hatred, short-sighted and watching the world through a twisted lens, irate Julián or the "Scorpion" and his best friend Luis are actively involved in a radical and violent neo-Nazi group led by the extremist Solís. But when Julián ends up at the local gym with the intention to learn how to fight, Carlomonte, a former boxing champion and now a retired athlete and alcoholic, will gradually teach him that with discipline, correct guidance and kindness, the bottled-up anger will soon dissipate, allowing his heart to trust once more. Before long, the once apt pupil of violence will find true love in the person of Alyssa, a young Latin-American immigrant, and with it, a new purpose in life, eventually, however, the Scorpion will need to pledge allegiance to the organisation and to his old friends. Has Julián the strength to renounce it?
