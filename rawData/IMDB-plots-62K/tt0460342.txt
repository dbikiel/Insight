In Paris, Ariane and Lena are sisters. Ariane writes photo novellas for the magazine "Toi et Moi." She's emotional and her long-time boyfriend, Farid, has her in a state because he won't propose, won't ask her to live with him, and often is unavailable. Lena is a cellist, quiet and circumspect in life and in her playing. She lives without passion with her boyfriend Fran√ßois; they're talking about having a baby. Suddenly the women have options: a cheerful and outgoing Spanish construction worker pays attention to Ariane, and Lena finds herself attracted to Mark, a passionate soloist leaving soon to play in Asia. What will the women - and men - do? Is life like a photo novella?
