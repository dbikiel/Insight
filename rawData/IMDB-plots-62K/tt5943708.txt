Focused on the world of wealthy Qatari sheikhs with a passion for amateur falconry, 'The Challenge' combines cinematic beauty with rare access and trailblazing form. Here, the opulence of Qatar is on full display, as the men race SUVs up and down sand dunes, fly their prized falcons around on private jets, and take their pet cheetahs out for desert spins in their souped-up Ferraris.
