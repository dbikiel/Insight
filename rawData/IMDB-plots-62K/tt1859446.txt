A group of people start a business where they impersonate the recently deceased in order to help their clients through the grieving process.
A night nurse in a hospital provides special services to families who have recently lost their loved ones. She is a member of a group called the Alps, whose members offer, for a fee, to play recently deceased during visits of their grieving relatives.
To ease the pain of the bereaved, and to facilitate a smooth transition to normalcy after the loss of a beloved one, a gloomy nurse; a stretcher-bearer; a rhythmic gymnast, and her coach form a secret company called "The Alps". At the right price, this clandestine society will become a cherished son or a dead spouse, and they even learn the beloved deceased's quirks and mannerisms to help the mourning process. For a few hours a day, the members of the Alps can be your loved one, working under very specific rules; however, what happens if one of them rebels, and becomes too attached to the client?
Alps centres on a group of professional stand-ins who take the place of lost loved ones, from spouses to pets. It's dark comedy by Yorgos Lanthimos, the followup to his his 2009 movie DOGTOOTH. ALPS is shockingly funny, drawing unexpected humour from the most bizarre of situations.
