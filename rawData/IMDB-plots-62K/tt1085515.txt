A Seattle weather girl freaks out on-air over her cheating boyfriend, the morning show anchor, and moves in with her little brother.
Sylvia, approaching 35, is the "sassy weather girl" at a Seattle TV station. On a live broadcast, she castigates her boyfriend Dale (who's the show's anchorman) for sleeping with his co-anchor; then she quits. She'd been living with Dale, who explains himself by saying she's cold, so she moves in temporarily with her younger brother Walt. His neighbor Byron, a computer programmer, is always in Walt's flat working. While Sylvia looks for a job, Byron offers himself as a no-strings-attached rebound-sex partner, with the condition that she not tell Walt. How will she respond, and what about finding work, living with her brother, sorting things out with Dale, and being cold?
A Seattle morning show weather girl, after learning her boyfriend has cheated on her, freaks out on-air and is fired. Forced to move in with her little brother and to cope with being 35, single and unemployed, she begins an unlikely romance with a younger man--her brother's best friend.
