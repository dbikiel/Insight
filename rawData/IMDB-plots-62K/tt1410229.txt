Cirque du Soleil presents KOOZA, the story of an innocent and charming clown who strives to find his own place in the world. The Innocent's journey introduces him to a panoply of comic characters. Between strength and fragility, laughter and chills, and turmoil and harmony, KOOZA, the 20th creation from Cirque du Soleil, explores themes of fear, identity, recognition and power. The show is set in an electrifying and exotic visual world full of surprises, thrills, audacity and total involvement. KOOZA, created and directed by David Shiner and filmed by Mario Janelle, combines two circus traditions - acrobatic performance and the art of clowning. The show highlights the physical demands of human performance in all its splendor and fragility, presented in a colorful "mélange" that emphasizes bold slapstick humor.
