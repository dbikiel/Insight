Beary Barrington goes on an adventure to save Country Bear Hall by getting the Country Bears back together for a reunion concert.
Based on an attraction at Disneyland, the Country Bear Jamboree, this movie is one in a long line of live action Disney family films. The movie is a satire of "Behind the Music" rock and roll bands. Beary, a young bear raised by a human family in a world where humans and talking bears coexist, attempts to trace his roots. He meets up with the Country Bears, a long-since broken-up band, a parody of bands like the Eagles. Beary helps the Country Bears reunite for one final concert, while searching for who he truly is.
Beary Barrinson, a ten-year-old bear cub raised by humans, heads for Tennessee to find his birth family. Along the way, he helps unite the once legendary Country Bear Band for a benefit show to save the Country Bear concert hall.
