A domineering mother with a seemingly perfect family in Argentina, is unaware of a taboo relationship happening with her youngest twin children.
Lucia and Daniel have three children: Ezequiel, who has gone to live in Spain, Jeremias and, their youngest, Meme. Lucia, a pretentious woman, believes she can control everything according to the criteria and habits of a typical wealthy Argentinean family. She is blind to the fact that Jeremias and Meme are conducting an illicit relationship under her own roof. Ezequiel arrives home from Spain with his fianc√©e, Montse, to get married, much to the great joy of his proud parents. The young couple's presence reveals the fragility of the order of things that had seemed so perfect. Love becomes a sin but its power resists any set morality.
