Society heiress Joan Bradford rebels against her mother's choice of a future husband by masquerading as a working class girl and dating a window washer.
Joan's parents want her to marry young Travis, but Joan has no interest in him. So on New Years Eve, she goes out to a club where she meets Bob. Things click and she rents an apartment in the city so that she can date Bob and he will not know that she is RICH. He works for the Peerless Window Cleaners, but hopes to soon have his own window cleaning company. The problems between Bob and Joan start when he see's Joan getting a check from an older man and also finds that she does not stay in her apartment after he drops her off.
