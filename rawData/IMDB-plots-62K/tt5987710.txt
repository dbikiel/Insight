After studying filmmaking I rediscovered a book, "The black book of Mexican Cinema", written by my mom's uncle, Miguel Contreras Torres. Through his investigations I find out about his memorable life and the situation he lived in, how he witnessed a fresh and healthy film industry go down in the hands of the monopolist William O. Jenkins. His fight announced the loss of Mexican cinema with its public, situation inherited up until today.
