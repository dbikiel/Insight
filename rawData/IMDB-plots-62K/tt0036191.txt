This lavish, impudent, adult fairy tale takes the viewer from 18th-century Braunschweig to St. Petersburg, Constantinople, Venice, and then to the moon using ingenious special effects, stunning location shooting.
A 1940's descendant (Hans Albers) of an eccentric German Baron recounts some of his ancestor's enhanced, exaggerated, and grandly unrealistic stories as he searches the world for the secret of eternal life. This feature is in pastel colors and is a bit grainy. It is spoken German, but is available subtitled.
