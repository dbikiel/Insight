An enthusiastic young couple is astounded with modern technology's giant leaps in the fascinating field of electricity.
According to the rapid strides that electricity is making in this wonderful age we are not surprised to see in this picture an ideal hotel of the future in which everything is done by electricity. We see a couple entering the hostelry and, after registering, the clerk touches a button and away goes the baggage on to the elevator, which stops at the proper floors and the grips enter the room without the aid of anyone. Many amusing incidents follow. Finally they pay the penalty for all the latest improvements, for something goes wrong with the electric plant in the cellar and mixes the whole place up. We see all the furnishings start to turn in all directions and the unfortunate guests find themselves in the midst of the affray. They manage to get to the door and are tumbled out and rolled across the street till out of the reach of the magnetic force, where they pick up their belongings and hurry home, vowing never to enter another electric hotel.
Anxious to check in at the innovative and state-of-the-art Electric Hotel where man's assistance is no longer required, a young couple is astounded with modern technology's giant leaps in the fascinating field of electricity. Indeed, as if by magic, the elevators work by themselves, personal grooming has never been easier, and everything seems to run like clockwork, nevertheless, such an indecipherable and powerful force of nature is not easily tamed.
