The assuming of responsibility by individuals, the use of science for man and not against him, the duty of truth to increase the stature of people, all together: these are the important themes this movie debates in allegorical form. Roles are performed by non professional actors and actresses.
The film revisits the story of the Three Wise Men who follow a star to Bethlehem to pay homage to the newborn Jesus. One night the astronomer-priest Mel and his disciple Rupo are scrutinizing the sky from within a ruined temple. They are surprized to see a very strong light. They interpret this as a sign of the coming of the Savior and decide, along with many citizens of the city, to start walking towards it to pay homage to the Savior and give him the gifts entrusted to them by the king. During this long walk, not all the travelers will make it to the destination. But they will also unite themselves with two other caravans. They will find the Savior in an abandoned castle, in the guise of a baby, and they will pay him homage. That very night, however, fearing an ambush by the troops of a jealous emperor, the tree caravans will disperse after having removed all signs of their visit. Only a soldier will return by night to the castle, but he will arrive after the troops of the emperor.
