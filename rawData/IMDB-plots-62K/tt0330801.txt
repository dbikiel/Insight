Apparently, rocks are having conversations all around us, but they talk very, very slowly...
The stone-people Hew and Kew have seen a lot in their everlasting lives on top of their mountain. Therefore they're only mildly amazed by the ongoings in the valley below, they've got their own little problems to deal with - But all of a sudden, Mankind is discovering and inventing, instead of just woozeling, and this new behavior starts to threaten Hew's and Kew's stoic peacefullness...
Atop a moist and rocky hillside, two boulders, one hulking and moss-covered, and a small but mischievous one, observe indolently the passage of time across the stony and rugged valley. Undoubtedly, to the ancient and ever-lasting rocks, time seems to stand still, to us humans, however, our short lifespan is nothing but a speck of sand in the eternal hourglass. With this in mind, the two friends of stone witness the transformation of the landscape as well as the rise and fall of human civilization, as man's technology has a tremendous impact on the planet. But is this the meaning of evolution?
