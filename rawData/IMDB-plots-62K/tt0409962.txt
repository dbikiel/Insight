Bored housewife Lisa Wayne embarks on a steamy affair with a younger man, Sam. But as her behavior grows more reckless, her cop husband, John, becomes quite suspicious - and Lisa's precarious situation grows even more dangerous.
When Sam Taylor (Rodney Scott) meets Lisa Wayne (Joan Severance), he experiences every 18-year old guy's ultimate fantasy: no-strings-attached sex with a beautiful, uninhibited older woman. However, as the summer between high school and college wears on, Sam learns that when it comes to sex there are always strings attached. Sam unwittingly becomes a pawn in Lisa's twisted emotional game.
