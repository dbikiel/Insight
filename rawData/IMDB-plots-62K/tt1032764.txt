Meanwhile, Marcos has violent dreams about an unfamiliar woman. Chronologies overlap, glass breaks. Can a mind lie to itself?
For nearly a year, Consuelo has been obsessed with a man who visits her in her dreams, a blue prince who does not exist, according to her friends. Richard has been suffering from nightmares in which a young attractive woman seduces him and then tries to kill him. He swears he doesnt know her. Slowly the dream-like world invades reality and both end up face to face, separated only by a mirror glass in a police station: Richard identifies her as the assassin of his fiancée; she points him out as the man who raped her.
