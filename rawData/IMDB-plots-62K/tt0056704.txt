In London, when Australian gangsters disguised as "Bobbies" rob British criminals, the panicked British mobsters seek an alliance with Scotland Yard in order to eliminate the foreign competition and return things to "normal".
The crooks in London know how it works. No one carries guns and no one resists the police. Then a new gang appears that goes one better. They dress as Police Officers and steal from the crooks. This upset's the natural order of the Police/criminal relationship, and the Police and the crooks join forces to catch the impersonating Police Officers, including an armored car robbery in which the Police must help the gangs to set a trap.
London in the Sixties. Organized crime gangs are working smoothly but know that, when confronted by the Police, they're "banged to rights" and need to "come quietly". This cosy balance, however, is disrupted when a group of Australian criminals impersonate the Metropolitan Police and make off with the proceeds of the crimes after duping the criminals. Realization of the operations of the people impersonating Police Officers slowly dawns on the criminals and then the Police. They then agree to work together to outwit the foreign impersonators. This leads to bungling attempts to capture the gang to great comic effect.
