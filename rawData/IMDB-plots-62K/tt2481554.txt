A man investigates the murder of his cat.
When someone murders his beloved cat, Clinton (Kranz), an adult child, demands justice. Taking it upon himself to solve the case, he teams up with an unlikely ally, Greta (Reed), and the two set out to find the culprit lurking in their small suburban town. But as Clinton searches for the truth, he begins to uncover a conspiracy that goes far deeper than he anticipated.
Immature Clinton Moisey is an odd fellow by his own admission, he who blames everything in his life on everyone else but himself. He lives in the small town of Bethany, California in the basement of his long divorced mother, Edie Moisey, who supports her son in any way she can including driving him wherever he needs to go since he doesn't own a car or drive. His comic book store, which was solely financed by Edie, went bust in six months, he blaming its demise on the big box retailer in town, Fords Superstore. Al Ford is the wealthy owner, operator and face (in its commercials) of the store. Clinton has now resorted to selling his merchandise in a perpetual yard sale cum roadside stand in front of the house. And he is creating lines of collectible figurines in which only he seems to have interest. Clinton's world goes from bad to worse when his best friend in the world, his cat Mouser, dies. Mouser is with Clinton in the basement as he dozes off to sleep, with the next moment of which he is aware, as he awakens, he sees a crowd of looky loos in front of the house hovered around dead Mouser, who was shot with an arrow. Clinton feels that he has to find who murdered Mouser as he believes no one, including the lead investigator, Sheriff Frank Hoyle, is taking the situation seriously. Clinton believes Sheriff Hoyle is even more interested in getting to know Edie. Clinton puts himself in one tenuous illegal situation after another in his quest to find the murderer, these situations which Hoyle tries to overlook to support Clinton. In the process, Clinton meets a young woman named Greta Chiplinsky, a former assistant manager at Fords, she who seems equally as invested in discovering Mouser's killer as he is for much the same reason as him. In their investigation, they stumble onto what looks to be a stolen goods ring which may be associated to Mouser's murder, they who may be placing themselves in mortal danger in the process.
