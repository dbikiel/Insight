A student's chances of getting into a good college hang in the balance when inappropriate photos of her are posted on the Internet.
An A-student's life is turned upside-down when inappropriate status updates and photos appear on her online profile. She claims she is being set up, but no one believes her. Her only solace during this crisis is her mother. Now she must figure out who is hacking her profile before her reputation and chance to get into a good college are ruined. Maybe it's her ex-boyfriend, a jealous friend competing for the same scholarship or someone far more dangerous than she could have ever imagined.
