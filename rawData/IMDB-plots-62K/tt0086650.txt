An erratic young woman's family desperately tries to prevent her increasingly erotic ways.
Suzanne is sixteen and is having sex with many boys, just for fun, but did not manage to really love one of them. Her family does not understand her. The father does not like her behaviour. When he leaves home, the mother becomes a little bit neurotic. And Suzanne's brother Robert, begins to beat her as a punishment.
Suzanne is enjoying life, sneaking out to fool around with her boyfriend, flirting with sailors until two key events alter her life and drive her into a unfulfilling cycle of pleasure seeking--she sleeps with an American which drives off her boyfriend and her father leaves the family for another woman. After this she bounces from boy to boy and relationships with her mother and brother escalate to violence. She continues to seek happiness in life without knowing how to love.
