After an unappreciated minister dies, his daughter loses her faith in God, prompting her to open a phony temple with a con man. Can the love of a blind aviator restore her faith and happiness?
After Florence Fallon's father dies unappreciated in the church where he preached for many years, she becomes embittered and loses faith. She teams up with Horsby, a con man, and performs fake miracles for profit. But the love and trust of a blind man restores her faith in God and her fellow man.
Sorry - the movie opens when Fallon's Father has died, preparing to preach his Sunday sermon. Florence steps up to the pulpit in tears and decries the congregation as hypocrites. This is one of the best moments of Stanwyck's early films as she literally drives them out of the church with her anger and passion. It's that passion that huckster Horsby picks up on. Stanwyck fans should see this at least once.
