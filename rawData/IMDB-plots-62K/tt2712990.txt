A feuding mother and daughter find an unlikely source of help to reunite them - at a hippie commune, the last place that conservative, high-brow Judith ever thought she'd step foot in.
Judith, an uptight widow, is appalled when her daughter Lily quits law school to move into a commune of hippie-misfits who live according to the behavioural principles of the bonobo monkey, a species famous for its 'make love not war' philosophy. Anita, the eccentric group leader, claims that she can resolve the conflict between mother &amp; daughter if Judith will spend a day among the commune and submit to its principles. But with mother and daughter both hell-bent on proving each other wrong, Anita's methods must now be put to the test as never before.
