A portrait of the late gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson.
Fueled by a raging libido, Wild Turkey, and superhuman doses of drugs, Thompson was a true "free lance, " goring sacred cows with impunity, hilarity, and a steel-eyed conviction for writing wrongs. Focusing on the good doctor's heyday, 1965 to 1975, the film includes clips of never-before-seen (nor heard) home movies, audiotapes, and passages from unpublished manuscripts.
A chronological look at the life and times of Hunter S. Thompson (1937-2005), with commentary by his wives, fellow journalists, elected officials, friends, and others. Key incidents detailed are his run for sheriff of a Colorado county, his book on the Hell's Angels, his writing for "Rolling Stone" about Las Vegas, Jimmy Carter, and George McGovern, and his connection to alcohol, drugs, and guns. A thesis of the film is that Thompson's persona as a Gonzo journalist devoured him. Archival footage of Thompson, Vietnam protests, 60's exuberance, political campaigns, and a Hollywood movie provide texture.
