A man discovers a box of interviews with his father, a heroin addict who died of AIDS in 1997. What he finds will uncover generations of family secrets, forcing him to redefine his own past, doubt his present, and question his future.
Over five years in the making, Getting Over is the passion project of a lifetime from filmmaker Jason Charnick. Given a box of video tapes by his uncle that chronicled his father's final days, it took him well over a decade to even face the image of his father again. In 1997, Jason's father and lifelong heroin addict Ray Charnick recorded 17 hours of video interviews with his brother, noted New York City artist Arnie Charnick. The topics covered his entire life, from his childhood growing up in the Bronx, up until just a few months before his death. When Jason finally felt ready to watch these tapes, what he saw would redefine many of the childhood memories he held so dear. It would also take him on an unexpected emotional journey, not only back home to New York, but into the past as well. Come along with Jason as he gets to know his dad again, accepts the man he was, and confronts the addiction that took his life.
