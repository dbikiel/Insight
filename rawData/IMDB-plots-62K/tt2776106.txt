The relationship between the two women is tense, Ewa urges him to have Sylwia move out of the apartment. He has also been growing more curious about some of the boys who have gay sex at the gym. At a gallery opening one night, he is totally bored and out of the place. While smoking a joint, he meets Michal and they strike up a conversation to Sylwia's delight. Sylwia picks up on his fascination, but Kuba has her heart. She keeps her feelings to herself, as from one day to the next Kuba puts Michal in the middle of his life with her.
