Radio sleuth Wally "The Fox" Benton forgoes his honeymoon to help his wife's old friend solve a murder and hunt for Civil War gold inside a spooky mansion and fort.
Radio sleuth Wally "the Fox" Benton travels to Georgia with his fiance Carol to be married, and to help Carol's college chum Ellie Mae solve a mystery involving a murdered man, old Fort Dixon and buried treasure.
Radio personality Wally 'The Fox' Benton lobbies his producers to give him a sabbatical so he can marry long-time girlfriend Carol Lambert, a co-worker on his popular weekly series. Coincidently Carol receives a beetle brooch from old classmate Ellamae Downs, a sorority cry for help. Carol presses Wally to go with her to Ellamae's hometown, a sleepy southern backwater built around an abandoned castle-like structure that was used as a Confederate arsenal during the Civil War. What he lacks in courage, 'The Fox' makes up with keen powers of deduction as he and his two female Watsons find themselves immersed in a web of murder, official corruption, and hidden treasure in the spooky gothic atmosphere of the old South.
