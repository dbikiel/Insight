Elephants: Spy In The Herd provides the most intimate portrayal of the everyday life of an elephant herd. Narrated by David Attenborough and filmed over a year, throughout the program the elephant herd exhibits many human similarities: their life span, social structure, wisdom of age and emotional bonds.Witness two males clashing over territory, the birth and slow development of a calf and jealous rivalries between herd members. A real sense of these animals' incredible flexibility and intimacy is shown as they bathe in mineral salts, mud and dust, while their astonishing sensory perceptions are also revealed. Spy cams based on dung expelled by the elephants themselves infiltrate the herd. Unlike Spy in the Wild, there is no animatronic egret.
