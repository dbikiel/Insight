A young garage mechanic (Bobby) and fast food hostess (Rose) meet and quickly fall in love. While out on a date one night, Bobby "fakes" holding up a convenience store. The prank goes horribly wrong, resulting in the death of a young shop keeper. The couple are now on the run from the law and themselves.
