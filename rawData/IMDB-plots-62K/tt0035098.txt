When a prisoner on Death Row is "accidentally" killed just before his execution, a reporter smells something fishy. His investigation reveals that the condemned man was about to reveal some damaging information about the connection between the city's corrupt political machine and its major organized crime ring. The reporter hatches a plan, with the help of the paper's alcoholic political columnist, to get himself thrown in prison to get the information the murdered prisoner was going to reveal and expose both the crooked politicians and the gangsters they're in cahoots with.
"Dapper Dan" Malloy, a convicted killer, is scheduled to die in the electric chair, but his lawyer has given his solemn promise that the governor will grant him a commuted sentence and, in fact, Mlloy will be able to hear the governor's announcement over his own earphone radio set an hour before the scheduled execution. Newspaper reporter "Scoop" Connor is assigned to cover the execution but passes out in his attempt to prepare himself for the ordeal. In his place goes Bert Bell who has been trying to land a job with the newspaper as a reporter and Gladys Wayne, a reporter already with the paper and anxious for Bert to get a break. And he does, as Malloy is apparently killed by a stoke of lightning while listening to his radio set. Bert thinks otherwise.
