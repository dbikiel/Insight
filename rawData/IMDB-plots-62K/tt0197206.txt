A man accidentally finds a gun inside a parked car and gets it. Later, always "by chance", he ends up using it by killing a man who leaves the stadium on Sunday afternoon. The film tells this lucid expectation, the daily life of man, the relationship with a series of people (the girlfriend, a friend, the father ...) but above all his relationship with this object, so "significant" to be pushed to commit an extreme act to make sense of one's existence.
