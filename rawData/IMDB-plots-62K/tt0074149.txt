In a series of largely independent vignettes, a man fantasizes about being a mob boss, faking his own kidnapping, gaining independence through violence, using witch-like powers, dating beautiful women, and becoming a charismatic leader.
A gangster relates the story of how he started his life of crime, beginning when as a child he faked his own kidnapping in order to get money from his parents for the "ransom". However, it turns out that the "gangster" may not be exactly what he seems.
