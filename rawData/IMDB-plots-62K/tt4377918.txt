A spoiled young girl is forced to tag along with her mom on a medical mission in Tarlac. There she meets a young man from a different world who shows her another side of life.
Sometimes, though we don't expect to find love, it's the one that finds us. In "Crazy Beautiful You," we are introduced to Jackie (Kathryn Bernardo), whose rebellious spirit forces her mother (Lorna Tolentino) to take her in a medical mission in Tarlac in hopes that she'd turn for the better. There, Jackie meets a jolly lad named Kiko (Daniel Padilla), who will make sure she gets all her tasks done. In the middle of his mission, he and Jackie will discover something crazy... and beautiful.
