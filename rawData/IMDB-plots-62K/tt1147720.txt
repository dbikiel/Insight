Spoiler warning!When Madeleine is diagnosed with Alzheimers, she makes two important decisions. One is to keep it from her family. The other is to revisit her beloved Gaspésie and relive, for one last time, the memories this evokes. Encountering Zoë, an emotionally disturbed young musician, Madeleine asks her to be her driver for the trip. The relationship between the two women develops into something much richer than either of them imagine at the outset, and Zoë is able to prevent the suicide that Madeleine has planned from the start.
