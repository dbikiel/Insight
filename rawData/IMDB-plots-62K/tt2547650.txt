As Brian and his team tackle the intimidating task of renovating the historic Croke Patterson Mansion in Denver, CO into a Bed and Breakfast hotel, the workers begin to report supernatural occurrences, from sightings of apparitions, whispering voices and peculiar odors. When some members of the team start to fall ill, and an unexplained fire threatens the projects completion, Brian begins to question the true nature of the Castle and the meaning behind these strange events.
"Is this place really haunted?" This seems to be the question that architect/filmmaker Brian Higgins gets asked every day on the steps of his new hotel renovation project. He won't tell you about it...he'll show you. The Castle Project is a gripping feature length documentary exploring the haunting, history and renovation of the historic Croke Patterson Campbell Mansion in Denver, Colorado. The 120 year history and folklore is filled with tragedy, suicides and guard dogs jumping out of third floor windows to escape a demonic presence. Will anyone want to stay at such a haunted hotel? This isn't based on a true story, it IS the true story.
