While ice-skating on a frozen pond, Bosko and his dog discover a baby abandoned in the snow.
Bosko ice skates on a frozen pond, while his dog Bruno chases behind him, barking happily. Bruno accidentally falls through the ice. The canny canine allows Bosko to think he has drowned before finally popping out of a hollow tree and barking out a greeting. Bosko is momentarily angry, but quickly forgives him. The fun ends when the two of them discover a baby abandoned in the snow. Bosko takes the infant to his cabin. The unlovable bundle does nothing but bawl and bawl, and finally infuriates Bruno when it declares its reason: it's crying for the Carolines. Undaunted, Bosko finally finds a way to make the crying baby laugh--but not without a near-drowning of his own.
