In rural Sicily, the fishermen live at the mercy of the greedy wholesalers. One family risks everything to buy their own boat and operate independently.
Poor Sicilian fishers are exploited by fish wholesalers. One of the families is trying to escape them by being their own boss. But fate nobody helps them, and even fate is against them.
Against the backdrop of extreme poverty in the late-1940s fishing village of Aci Trezza, the impecunious family of the working-class fishermen, the Valastros, struggle to eke out a living. Refusing to bow down and accept this dire situation lying down, the desperate 'Ntoni Valastro summons up the courage to cut out the rapacious middlemen and buys a small fishing boat after mortgaging their decrepit house. However, fate has other plans, and the results of 'Ntoni's middlemen-free enterprise are disastrous. Who can stand on his feet when the Earth trembles?
In 1947, in Sicily near Catania, the fishermen in Aci Trezza for generations have been exploited by the local middlemen. The young 'Ntoni Valastro rebels against the economical situation of his poor family. He convinces the Valastro to mortgage their simple house in the Fidania Bank in Catania to buy a fish boat of their own and never work again for the wholesalers. One stormy day, he decides to fish due to the necessity of repaying the debt to the bank.
