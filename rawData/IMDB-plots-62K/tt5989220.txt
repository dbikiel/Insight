The story of female friendship as Frenchwoman Claire helps the subject of her photograph, Min-Hee, discover why she was fired without apparent cause.
On a business trip to the Cannes Film Festival, Manhee is accused of being dishonest, and fired. A teacher named Claire goes around taking photos with a Polaroid camera. She gets to know Manhee and sympathizes with her. Claire is like a person who can see Manhee's possible future or past selves, through the mysterious power of the beach tunnel. Through taking photos, Claire has acquired the ability to look slowly at things, and to transform objects. Now, Claire goes with Manhee to the caf√© where she was fired. We look forward to seeing Claire's power at work.
