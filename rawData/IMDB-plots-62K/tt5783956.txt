Noah meets Avery at a Halloween party and falls in love but gets friend-zoned. 3 years later she's engaged to someone else. Noah uses the photo booth time machine several times to return and fix things. Will it work or...?
Noah thinks he has the perfect first night with Avery, the girl of his dreams, but gets relegated to the friend zone. He spends the next three years wondering what went wrong - until he gets the unexpected chance to travel back in time and change that night - and his fate - over and over again.
