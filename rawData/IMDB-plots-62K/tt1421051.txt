After withdrawing to the Chateau Marmont, a passionless Hollywood actor reexamines his life when his eleven-year-old daughter surprises him with a visit.
Hollywood actor Johnny Marco, nested in his luxury hotel of choice, is a stimulated man. Drinking, parties and women keep a creeping boredom under wraps in between jobs. He is the occasional father of a bright girl, Cleo, who may be spoiled but doesn't act it. When Cleo's mother drops her off and leaves town, Johnny brings her along for the ride, but can he fit an 11-year-old girl into his privileged lifestyle?
Johnny Marco is a Hollywood star who leads an empty life: alcohol, women, and a Ferrari. As he lethargically promotes his newest film, including a quick trip to Milan, the one bright and human spot in his life is his pre-teen daughter Cleo. When Cleo's mom decides she needs a break, Johnny has Cleo for the week before she goes to summer camp. In balancing fatherhood, promos, and drop-by women, Johnny comes to a realization. After Cleo's gone to camp, is he stuck in nowhere?
Writer/director Sofia Coppolas film is an intimate story set in contemporary Los Angeles; Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff) is a bad-boy actor stumbling through a life of excess (frenzied girls, booze and cars) at the Chateau Marmont Hotel, totally disconnected from the real life. With an unexpected visit from his 11-year-old daughter (Elle Fanning), Johnny is forced to look at the questions every father has to confront. Cleo surprisingly shows up and begins to grow fond of him, getting Johnnys connection to the real world to revive in her. As soon as Cleo leaves Marco is terribly lost but with the gift of being someone different. Coppola depicts a wonderful mood and atomosphere, the mellanchionic and spiritual touch being similar to the one of "Lost in Translation".
