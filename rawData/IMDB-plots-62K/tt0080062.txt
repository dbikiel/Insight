An astronaut and his android double travel back to the time of King Arthur.
A NASA spacecraft proves Einstein right when, traveling faster than light, it ends up near King Arthur's Camelot. On board are big-hearted Tom Trimble and Hermes, the look-alike robot he built. Tom immediately makes friends with pretty Alisande and enemies with the awful knight Sir Mordred. It seems Mordred is out to oust Arthur, while Alisande's father is not the goose she believes him to be but is also a victim of Mordred's schemes. It's as well the Americans have arrived.
