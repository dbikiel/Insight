Samuel returns home from his work at hardware store, where he works with Lola, with a branch of flowers, only to find his wife Ashley cheating on him with Damien on their own marriage anniversary, holding them captive at gunpoint on a hot New Orleans day, while he decides their fates. At first, he shoots both of them, but then finds himself re-experiencing the events in his mind. Instead of shooting them, he forces Ashley and Damien to disclose about their personal lives and their sexual encounters. He learns that he has a three-month pregnant wife, Jasmine, and that Ashley's abusive ex-boyfriend was actually her ex-husband. He has Damien call Jasmine, using the speaker phone so all can hear the conversation that is about to take place, and tell her what he has just done with Ashley. Jasmine reveals that he has cheated on her numerous times in the past. Devastated, Jasmine is asked by Samuel to decide Damien's fate, whether to return home to her, or let Samuel shoot him. He alludes to some suggestive decision from her to come there and confront Damien in person, and have sexual intercourse with Samuel to show how she felt about being cheated upon.
