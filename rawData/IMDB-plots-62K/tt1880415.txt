Henry is a loner and a night owl. His rare skin disease has kept him under the close watch of his fiery mother, who has sheltered him his entire life. One night, a young woman's car breaks down and Henry's life will change forever.
Henry is a loner, living with his overprotective mother in a small Southern town called Battlecreek. Henry has a rare sun disease and must avoid sunlight. He lives his life at night -- hanging out at the diner, working the night shift at the gas station and swimming in the creek under the moonlight. Henry doesn't know who he is or what he wants, until he meets Alison. When Alison's car breaks down in Battlecreek, she answers the "help wanted" sign at the diner to pay for the repair. Henry is immediately drawn to the mysterious girl. Alison shows Henry that he can live a life he thought impossible, even at the cost of losing his mom and freeing him from his past.
