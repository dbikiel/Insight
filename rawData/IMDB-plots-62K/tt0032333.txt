A maternity ward, staffed by sympathetic nurses, serves mothers-to-be from all walks of life. These include a happy mother of a large family; a secretly-married teenager who thinks their parents won't approve of either their children's marriage or baby; a woman who is trying for a living child despite a history of stillbirths; a showgirl who doesn't want a child, and who is shocked to find she is having twins; and a convicted murderess whose husband is forced to choose between saving her or the baby.
