Randy Quaid as the taxi driver drives Zen parables (Is time money - Is time the root of all evil?) into his passenger/protegee in a high-speed, idiosyncratic tour of their city's ethnic coteries. All the boy wants is to dispose of his date's dead dog Jasper and get back to the babe who's so hot she mutters darkly about being a Pressure Cooker: his conventional efforts are continually thwarted. Quaid is respected by the peculiar groups he interests in the dog's corpse and effects, and our one-gloved heroine is much keener on him than on her rather lackluster date.
Teenage Michael meets the gorgeous Sarah in a fitness studio. He accosts her and manages to get a date for dinner. There's just one problem: not only is her mother and obnoxious dog Jasper with them, but the dog suddenly falls dead! Sarah's mother wants him buried immediately and sends out Michael to the next park - with a promise for a more intimate party from Sarah later. So he sets out to do it quickly - but wanna-be taxi driver Jack persuades him to make money of the dog's body. They begin a travel through the city at night... it turns difficult to get rid of the dog's body and to return in time for his intimate date.
