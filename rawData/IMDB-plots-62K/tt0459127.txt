A comedy about four young adults adrift in Mexico City.
At 18, fresh from high school, Marina, Ignacio, Adam and Mimi, school mates bonded by fate, shared a dream about adult life, a dream of fame, success, perfect skin and that one endless, true love that, surely, was waiting just around the corner for each one of them. But 30's arrived, and none of the sweet promises of youth was fulfilled. Alone, failed and frustrated, all four are forced to stop and look around to try to understand where it all went wrong, and find an emergency fix for their lives, before it's too late, and happiness escapes through their fingers forever. Secondary Effects is the bitter coming of age comedy that follows their steps in the search for lost dreams, lost hair and good sex, at least, if true love turns out to be a mirage.
Marina, Adán, Mimí, and Ignacio met in high school. Marina and Adan were best friends; they shared secrets, chewing gum, and even pajamas. One of Marina's biggest secrets was that she was madly in love with Ignacio, but he barely noticed she was alive. Meanwhile, Adan bullied and picked on Mimi nearly every single day, and it drove her crazy. Twelve years later, the four meet again at their high school reunion, with some of the same old baggage, doubts, and questions that haunted them then, and some new ones, that come with being on the verge of turning 30: Who am I? What should I do with my life? Who do I want to spend the rest of my life with? What ever happened to that old flame? How did ever I get so screwed up, and whose fault is it? Instead of answers, the four find revenge, romance, chases, love songs in the middle of the night (and of the street), hit and run accidents, collapsing buildings, vodka, foreplay, flight attendants, psycho bees, Cheetos, Twinkies, butterflies, true love, sheep, the greatest kiss in the world, and a dead cat. And the four also find, by the end of this dark comedy, that everything in life has Side Effects.
