A sendup of all the teen movies that have accumulated in the past two decades.
At John Hughes High School, the students are the same as just about every other teenager in a teen movie. The popular jock, Jake, takes a bet from Austin, the cocky blonde guy, that he can transform Janey, the pretty ugly girl, into the prom queen before the prom. But two people are trying to stop Jake from succeeding: his evil sister, Catherine, the cruelest girl in school, and Priscilla, the bitchy cheerleader. And all of their friends are the same as any other teen movie: Areola, the naked foreign exchange student, Les, the beautiful weirdo, Malik, the token black guy, the desperate virgins, Amanda Becker, the perfect girl, Ricky, Janey's obsessed best friend, and Sadie, the VERY old undercover reporter.
After breaking up with his girlfriend, Priscilla, a popular jock, Jake Wyler makes a bet with his friends, that he can't make 'ugly girl' Janey Briggs into prom queen. After spending more and more time with Janey, Jake really starts to think whether he wants to keep the bet on or not.
This movie is a complete spoof of the Freddie Prinz/Rachel Leigh Cook movie "She's All That." It is a great takeoff with lines appropriately modified to fit the satire genre and even includes a word for word reference to one of Freddie's lines in the original movie. From the minute I started watching this flick, I knew exactly what it was about and exactly where it was going. It was corny, but I enjoyed every minute of it.
