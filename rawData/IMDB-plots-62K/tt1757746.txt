A scientist who has invented a technology to construct virtual realities from people's memories finds himself in a perilous situation, after he reluctantly allows it to be used for a purpose he never imagined.
Successful scientist Tom has designed a revolutionary technique to transfer himself into the mind of other people. In search for sponsors and the much needed money he ends up being pushed towards an early test drive and application of his technique in a way he did not have in mind when developing it. He is expected to connect to the mind of a drug-addict killer in the hope of clarifying what happened when he supposedly committed murder of his girlfriend. When Tom starts his experiment prematurely and under much time pressure, connecting to the mind of the presumed killer Anthony (Dominic Bogart), a technical breakdown happens and the connection is cut, trapping Tom inside his own mental construct which is the bridge to the killer's mind. Not only could he not establish whether Anthony is guilty of the murder of his girlfriend, but he cannot get out of the constraints of that mental connection and runs danger of losing everything, his real life, his family, his own sanity. He needs to devise his exit from his mental prison and this can only be achieved through solving the riddle in Anthony's drug fogged mind.
