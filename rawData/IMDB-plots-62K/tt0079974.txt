A brainless teen comedy, pepped up with a few moderate erotic scenes. The plot: Roy is jealous of Sigi, who attracts Nancy's attention, and has two clumsy guys demolish Sigi's father's T-Burn classic. For the repair of the car, Sigi desperately needs $250 until his father returns next weekend. He and his friends try to earn it on the swap meet.
