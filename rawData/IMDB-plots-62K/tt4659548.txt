The film on the life of guru Osho Rajneesh and his spiritual journey to enlightenment.
How the innocent and intrinsic questions of a child ripen into the inner rebellion of a youth, through which ultimately a rebellious flower blooms, who shares the fragrance unconditionally. The story is a bouquet of hand-picked flowers from the garden of an unending celebration. Inspired by the life of Osho, it's a first feature film on the spiritual guru Rajneesh Osho.
