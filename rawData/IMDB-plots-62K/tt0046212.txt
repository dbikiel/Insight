While awaiting his certificate to practice medicine, John Page takes a position the the secret reform school for rich girl-delinquents run by hard-bitten Miss Dixon. Page is forced to treat a girl called Mrs. Jean Thorpe, heiress to a large fortune and wife of athletic instructor Max Thorpe. He learns that the real Mrs. Thorpe is dead, and his patient is being kept drugged until she can come into the fortune, when Thorpe and Miss Dixon plan to kill her. His threat to expose them leads to his firing and Dixon's threat to report him for practicing medicine without a license. Page instigates a riot among the problem girls at the school that covers his rescue of the drugged girl to safety.
