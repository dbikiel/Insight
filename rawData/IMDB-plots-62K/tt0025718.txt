An heiress switches places with her secretary in order to find a man who will love her for who she is and not for her money.
Dorothy Hunter is an heiress of untold wealth. She believes no one will love her for herself and not for her money, so she pretends to be her secretary Sylvia while Sylvia pretends to be Dorothy. The real Dorothy, attracted to handsome young Tony Travers, pushes him to fall in love with the fake Dorothy, believing that if he does, it proves he is only after her money. But Dorothy's scheme is too complicated and begins to backfire, leaving everyone, especially Dorothy, confused about who loves whom.
