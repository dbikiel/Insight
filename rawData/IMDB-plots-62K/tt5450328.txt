This tragicomedy begins when a man wakes up with a low ringing sound in his ears and discovers a cryptic note on his fridge "Your friend Luigi has died. P.S. I took the car."
A man wakes up one morning with an annoying ringing sound in his ears. A note on the fridge says: 'your friend Luigi has died. P.S. I took the car'. The problem is that he does not even remember who this guy Luigi is. This is just the beginning of a tragicomic day during which he will be plunged into the folly of the world. One of those days that change your life forever.
DIRECTOR'S NOTES I knew from the start that Ears, as I imagined it, was a comedy that could never have been made according to the usual ways and means of production. The style of filming, consisting of long takes, with extended pauses and silences, the challenge of trying to create a comedy that depends on dialogue rather than on situations using an infinitely small event (waking up with a ringing sound in one's ears) in order to refer to infinitely greater themes, while always keeping a light touch, makes Ears a rather strange and oblique comedy, which is rather unusual within the Italian panorama of film production. For this reason the Biennale College - Cinema of the Venice Film Festival provided the perfect opportunity as the limitation of the super low budget offered creative freedom I needed. Every time I sat down to write scenes I imagined them in black and white, as if I could not see them in any other way, and as if there was a need to strain or filter the images in order to free them from colour, so that they could completely attain their most basic impact: that of the face, of the word, and of the whole scene.
