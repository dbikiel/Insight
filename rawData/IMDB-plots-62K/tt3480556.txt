A man leaves special forces and hides away as handyman in Bucharest. He befriends two sisters living next door. When the Russian mob threatens them, he takes action.
After an illustrious special ops career ends in disaster, Alexander (Seagal) goes off the grid and attempts to lead a quiet life as a handyman at an apartment complex in Romania. But when one of his tenants and her family fall under the thumb of a local gangster, Alexander is dragged into an all-out war between rival Chinese and Russian gangs; forcing him to not only defend the family, but bringing him face to face with an old foe, and giving him one more chance to reconcile his past.
