A devoted and happily-married housewife organises a surprise party on the occasion of her husband's birthday, unbeknownst to her that her dentist spouse is experiencing a sudden mid-life crisis at his office.
Margaret Fish is planning a surprise party for her dentist husband, Bob. Meanwhile, at the office, Bob his having a mid-life crisis while insects munch on what's left of his plants. When Bob returns home, Margaret has a terrible time getting him into the room where everyone's hidden until he's halfway through changing clothes and talking about how horrid all their nebbishy friends are (the same friends hidden all over the room).
On the occasion of her beloved husband's 40th birthday, a devoted and happily-married housewife, Margaret Fish, plans a splendid and joyful celebration. Meticulously, Margaret has organised every little detail of the surprise party, unbeknownst to her, however, that her dentist spouse is experiencing a sudden mid-life crisis at his office. Without a doubt, sometimes, even the best of plans can fail miserably.
