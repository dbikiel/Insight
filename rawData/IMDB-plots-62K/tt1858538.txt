The snow is staying away from the Bavarian ski village of Haunzenberg, and so are the skiers. Business is failing and so is Georg's relationship with Emilie. During his attempt to reignite the fires of passion, the wooden cross in the next room falls down, crushing Emilie's very Catholic mother Daisy. Wracked with guilt, Georg and his drinking buddies hatch a plan to have Daisy canonized by the Church, hoping to save both the village and his relationship. Everything goes according to plan until the Vatican sends a Priest to examine the miracles of Saint Daisy...
A month-long snow drought has left the lovely ski resort Haunzenberg in a coma. Unfortunately the same can be said of Georg's relationship with Emilie, especially after his attempt to rekindle Emilie's passion kind of - though only based on belabored reasoning, but indeed, sort of indirectly - caused his mother-in-law's death; or is, at least, to blame for a wooden cross falling from the wall of the adjoining room, with tragically fatal effect for Daisy, Emilie's devout mother. God bless her soul - To some it may seem the product of a bunch of schnapps-addled brains, but to others, notably Georg and his pub buddies, it sounds more like a brilliant plan, to rescue both love and the village - at any rate, Georg sets out to have Daisy canonized. Then, when a Vatican emissary actually arrives to investigate the deeds of SAINT DAISY, Haunzenberg witnesses a series of marvelous miracles.
