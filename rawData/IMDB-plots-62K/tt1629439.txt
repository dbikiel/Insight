When reporters are granted access to Area 51 Air Force base, a breach of security turns the protected government base into a horrifying destination of terror.
51 chronicles what happens after political pressure from the American public forces the Air Force to provide a few well-known reporters with limited access to the most secretive base on the planet: Area 51. When one of the base's hidden 'long term visitors' exploits this unprecedented visit as a chance to liberate himself and his fellow alien captives, Area 51 turns from a secure government base to a horrifying destination of terror.
In Area 51, the tough Colonel Ronald Martin decides to open the facility to the reporters Claire Felon and Sam Whitaker and their crew to satisfy the public opinion. Col. Martin denies the existence of aliens and invites the journalists to visit the two floors in the underground facility. Meanwhile, in the top secret four floors below, one shape shifter alien called Patient Zero capable to replicate any humanoid form escape and releases the dangerous aliens Little Devil and Lady Death. While Col. Martin and his soldiers hunt them down, Sergeant Hanna and her team protect the exit and are the last barrier to avoid the aliens from escaping.
