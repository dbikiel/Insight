After a Senator suddenly dies after completing (and sealing) an investigation into the nuclear power industry, the remaining Senator and the state Governor must decide on a person who will play along with their shady deals and not cause any problems. They decide on Billy Jack, currently sitting in prison after being sent to jail at the end of his previous film, as they don't expect him to be capable of much, and they think he will attract young voters to the party. Billy is pardoned, released, and nominated, after which he begins his duties. He soon notices that things aren't right, and starts trying to find out just what is going on.
This is a modernizing of the classic Mr. Smith Goes to Washington with the only major exceptions being that it includes a bit of karate and that it bears the undeniable anti-nuke sentiment and even includes much of the original script and original words in full and names of the characters, sometimes borrowing heavily on the original musical score. As with the original, the Hero wishes to build a camp and is wanting to put it in the way of huge power plant being built to fulfill a graft in the home state and in the process is framed for owning the land for the two projects and filibusters to be heard "back home" and pushes for a "national innitiative" to get a vote from everyone on every issue instead of a Congressional and Representative Republic.
