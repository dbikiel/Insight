The evil Nasty comes to our world with two objectives - kidnap Buji, and carry as much candy as possible back to his world. He has the ability to 'shape-shift', and using the appearance of Dibu, he holds up a bank so that he can get enough money to buy the candy. The police wrongly imprison Dibu, who manages to escape and confront Nasty.
