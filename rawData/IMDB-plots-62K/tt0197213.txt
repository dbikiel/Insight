This parody of popular Japanese teenage girls' romances includes slapstick in a comedy of robbers versus robbers. When a gas leak explodes at a yakuza's headquarters, a shy, timid nurse and a meek rental car clerk gain possession of a briefcase of blood-soaked money. The rest is chase and escape, as the nurse is transformed to glamorous heroine and outsmarts the gangsters eager to recover the loot.
