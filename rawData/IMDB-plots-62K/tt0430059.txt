Director João Moreira Salles and a small crew followed Presidential candidate Luís Inácio Lula da Silva's campaign in meetings, rallies, planes, TV debates, with his family, political allies and marketeers, from Sept.25 to Oct.28 2002, when he was officially elected President with 53 million votes, the first Brazilian President to come from the working classes (he is a former metalworker and union leader).
In 2002, the Brazilian director João Moreira Salles followed with his crew the candidate Luís Inácio Lula da Silva in his campaign for President of Brazil. The collection of footages in meetings, debates, hotels, airplanes and other places with his political allies and friends and acquaintances have been edited in an interesting documentary about the behind scene life of Lula.
Entreatos offers a behind-the-scenes look at Lula's 2002 presidential campaign based on 240 hours of exclusive footage taken by Salles's crew, which had extraordinary access to the candidate.
