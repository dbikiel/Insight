Michael, Arjun and Lallan, three men from three different strata of society, cross paths one morning in Calcutta and change one another's lives forever.
Michael (Ajay Devgan) , Arjun (Vivek Oberoi) and Lallan (Abhishek Bachchan) are three young men in Kolkata , with different ideals and objectives . Michael is an idealistic youth leader who dreams of a better India being created by the youth power . Arjun is a self-centered , opportunistic , easygoing fellow whose objective is to immigrate to a developed country and make big money . Lallan is a goon who works for Prosenjit Chatterjee (Om Puri) , an immoral politician . The lives of these three different people become intertwined following a murder attempt and an accident in broad daylight on the Hooghly bridge .
Kolkata-based Arjun Balchandran is a slacker, lives a wealthy lifestyle and is in love with Mira and is all set to re-locate to the United States of America. Then he meets with Michael Mukherjee, who was also preparing to re-locate to the United States, but changes his mind and instead becomes involved with him in opposing a politician named Prosonjit Bhattacharya from getting involved in college and university elections - so much so that Prosonjit decides to do away with Michael and in order to do this hires a goon named Lallan, who was originally born in Uttar Pradesh, but has since got married to Sashi, and is now settled in Kolkata. Watch what happens when Lallan accepts Prosonjit's contract and sets about to do what he does best - killing and terrorizing - and with the blessings of politicians from the ruling party - he is virtually unstoppable.
