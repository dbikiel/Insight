Two teen witches who were separated at birth and were adopted by two different families meet on their 21st birthday and must use their powers to save the world in which they were born, where their birth mother still lives.
In the magic realm of Coventry, the twin sisters Artemis and Apolla are saved by their protectors Illeana and Karsh from the Darkness and brought to another dimension. They are adopted by different families but in their twenty-first birthday, their protectors force them to meet each other. Alex Fielding lost her mother three months ago and is alone seeking a job while Camryn Barnes lives with her beloved wealthy parents. Once together they find that they have magic powers and they should return to Coventry to save their biological mother and their kingdom from the Darkness.
Identical twins, Alex Fielding and Camryn Barnes (Tia and Tamera Mowry) were separated shortly after their birth in an otherworldly magical kingdom called Coventry and quickly sent to Earth to escape the dangers of an evil force. Unaware of each other's existence, the girls are adopted by two different families and grow up in opposite worlds - Alex lives in a small one bedroom apartment with a working-class mother while Camryn lives in a mansion and wants for nothing. When the girls are reunited on their 21st birthday their powers start to form and their birth mother Miranda (Kristin Wilson), who thought her precious daughters were dead, can sense they are alive. While Alex and Camryn struggle to discover and accept the truth about their past and the extent of their magic, they set out to find their birth mother to get the answers they are looking for.
