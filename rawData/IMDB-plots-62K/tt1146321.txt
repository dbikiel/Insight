After a tragic plane crash, a local journalist discovers a note that she believes was written by one of the passengers. She seeks the note's intended receiver, but the journey is more revealing of her own past.
When a plane crashes, Newspaper columnist Peyton MacGruder discovers a Note that was meant for the child of one of the passengers. "The Note" shows how dramatically life can change in a spilt second...the need to make a connection and reach out to someone you care about. If only we had a chance for those final goodbyes, to offer words of reconciliation, to say I love you or share regret. Who would you write to if you had only a few moments? What would you say?
Unlike mentor Kingston Danville, a Pulitzer prize-winning sports reporter, Middlesborough newspaper hearts columnist Peyton MacGruder's dwindling readership will mean dismissal unless it picks up by Christmas. She fails to rival with TV star reporter Truman at interviewing people after a local plain crash, but accidentally finds a victim's hastily hand-written note to T. 'All is forgiven, I love you, dad'. She bets her career at racing the clock to find the surviving descendant it was sent to, but Truman snatches the prey away in the last stage. However, then someone steps forward who excites and comforts Grace both in this matter and the regret of her life.
