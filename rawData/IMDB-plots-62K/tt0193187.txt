Charlie Boyle finds that even his high IQ can't solve all of his problems when he takes on a double life in order to make friends his own age.
Charlie, science wiz, hockey lover, and all around genius, is tired of being friendless. It's bad enough that he's in college before he's 14 helping a scientist who's in the midst of trying to defy gravity. So, in order to make his life exactly how he wants it, Charlie reinvents himself by taking on the image of a slacker/bad boy and enrolls in the local Jr. high. But juggling two lives is tough, even for a genius.
