A woman walks by her home and finally takes a shower - She buy colored fabrics in a trade. A man visiting a post office - Succession of scenic pictures and semi-autonomous fading almost always unexpected. A series of situations or suite, though apparently unrelated, revolve around a thematic development that gives body and drive the story without resorting to the use of an anecdote as plot continuity.
