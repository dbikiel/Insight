Together, these brothers train with the legendary sensei rat, Splinter, to master the martial art of Ninjitsu. In this truly turtle powered tale, the turtles from one dimension meet the turtles from another dimension when a teleporting mishap occurs. What the shell is going on? Together, the turtles must locate the Technodrome to fix this mess! Meanwhile, Shredder tracks down his counterpart, Ch'rell, who devises a master plan to travel back to the Prime Universe to get rid of the turtles once and for all! As worlds collide, the turtles come face to face with classic characters like Casey and April, and a slew of enemies including Krang, Hun, the Foot Soldiers, the Purple Dragons, Bebop and Rocksteady!
