Victim of a plot which has resulted in his imprisonment in a Central African jail for two years, a French secret agent arrives in Paris to settle accounts.
French secret agent Joss Baumont is sent to one of the African countries to kill their president Njala. However, at the last moment the political situation changes and the French secret service turns him in to the African authorities, and he is sentenced to a long-term imprisonment. After the daring escape he returns to France and deliberately informs his former chiefs of his presence promising them to kill Njala who has just arrived to the country with the official visit.
The film tells us a story of a secret agent Josselin Beaumont (Jean-Paul Belmondo) sent to assassinate president N'Jala (Pierre Saintons), the dictator in Malagawi, a fictional state somewhere in Africa. However, after Joss leaves France, the political situation between France and Malagawi somehow changes and the French cabinet is obliged to report Malagawi about Joss so they know about his arrival and therefore can take appropriate action. The rest of the film is about fulfilling the given command by any means. His intention of assassinating N'Jala remains unchanged.
