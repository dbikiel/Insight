Opitz tries to track down the reasons of our shortage of time and for the constant acceleration of our lives. In his search of lost time he visits several people, to find out how they deal with time. He reveals the disturbing picture of a civilisation, that has disposed of all brake systems and, run by autopilot, goes blindly for unlimited and eternal growth, no matter what the consequences are.
