A struggling circus finds salvation in the form of an exciting new twist on their high-wire act.
High drama beneath the big top. Forbidden romance, rivalry, murder, betrayed friends. A retired hypnotist falls in love with a trapeze artiste whose jealous partner is the brother of the circus owner.
The nearly bankrupt Danton Empire Circus hires a drifter who uses his mental powers to calm and subdue an escaped lion. He offers to make their act in which a beautiful girl slides down a wire more exciting by hypnotizing her so she will not need a parasol for balance. The act works and the circus becomes profitable. But the hypnotist falls in love with the girl, and uses his mental powers to begin to control her life outside of the big top.
