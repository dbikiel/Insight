A mom has one night to do some tasks in LA requiring a gun, if she wants to see her son alive. He's held by a mob boss.
Vladik Zorich (Dolph Lundgren), crime lord whose tentacles permeate the underbelly of a seedy Los Angeles as he deals in guns, gambling, drugs and skin trafficking, finds himself double-crossed by his most trusted operative Rhona Zyocki (Natalie Burn). Vladik's propensity for power, control, and violence drives him to kidnap Rhona's young son, forcing Rhona to participate in a planned elimination of Vladik's enemies and identities. As her son's life hangs in the balance, Rhona struggles to find and kill Vladik's most violent and twisted foes and regain valuable goods and information, all in one fateful night. To keep her on a short leash, Vladik sets out the 'rules' to his 'game' and overseas Rhona's every move as she navigates the darkened streets of Los Angeles. However, Vladik underestimates the power of a mother's love, and finds himself losing control as his devious plan slowly unravels.
