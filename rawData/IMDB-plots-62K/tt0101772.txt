In nazi-occupied Denmark, a group of school-mates form a gang devoted to resistance against the occupying forces, but they don't go any further than putting up posters and steeling German soldiers' helmets. But then Otto Hvidmann joins the group, and he knows how to get hold of guns. Soon the game turns deadly serious.
