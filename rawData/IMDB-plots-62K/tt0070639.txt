In a daring ambush on the beach Moncada, elusive leader of the rebel army, is captured by Jim Haygood and turned over to the authorities. That night, Jim celebrates his success in a nightclub, where he meets two glamorous young girl entertainers, Amanda of the High Wire (Carol Speed) and Vicky the Knife-Thrower (Lada Edmund Jr.). A reporter bursts in with the news that Moncada is dead, accusing Jim of the cold-blooded murder of the rebel leader.

He hides out in Amanda and Vicky's dressing-room. During a raid by the military police, Vicky is caught and interned but Jim commandeers an army jeep and escapes into the mountains with Amanda. Jim and Amanda are then taken prisoner by the rebel forces but in a major battle between the rebels and the army Jim proves his true colors. In a brilliant coup he redirects the enemy planes to attack their own troops. From then on, through a swift series of daring exploits Jim Haygood emerges as the new rebel leader, "SAVAGE" in name and deed.
