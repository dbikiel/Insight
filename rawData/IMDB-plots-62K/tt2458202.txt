"Beyond Right &amp; Wrong" looks at areas of conflict around the world and asks what it takes to forgive, and what it takes to ask for forgiveness under the most difficult of circumstances. Paired personal interviews of aggressors and victims from Northern Ireland, Rwanda, Israel, and Palestine, BEYOND RIGHT AND WRONG examines anger, understanding, remorse, tolerance, and sometimes clemency. The survivors' stories are haunting and inspiring, and the film is a meditation on justice and its role in national and personal healing.
'Beyond Right and Wrong' explores the journeys of the daughter of a man killed in a terrorist bombing in Great Britain, a mother whose five children were murdered in the genocide in Rwanda, and a father whose daughter was killed by a suicide bomber in Israel. After the blood has dried,treaties are negotiated and screams have turned to silence, victims and perpetrators face an uneasy and painful peace. The film not only portrays the resilience of humanity but also the tension that exists between rage and acceptance, justice and forgiveness. The stories told in the film are about the extreme cases, scattered across several continents. They are really the human story, of everyday possibilities in life.
