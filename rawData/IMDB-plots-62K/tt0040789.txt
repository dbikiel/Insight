After Mike McComb is booted out of the cavalry, he becomes riverboat gambler and silver mine owner in Nevada.
Unjustly booted out of the cavalry, Mike McComb strikes out for Nevada, and deciding never to be used again, ruthlessly works his way up to becoming one of the most powerful silver magnates in the west. His empire begins to fall apart as the other mining combines rise against him and his stubbornness loses him the support of his wife and old friends.
Cashiered from the Union Army, Mike McComb turns riverboat gambler. Aboard a steamboat he meets Georgia Moore, whose husband owns the Silver River mine. Mike opens up a gaudy gambling establishment nearby. He is soon the leading gambler and banker of the town and is madly in love with Mrs. Moore. Any problem with that is soon solved when her husband is killed by Indians. He marries the widow and all seems fine and dandy, but his old enemies form a combine/cartel to corner the silver market...and to wreck his empire. And Georgia hears whispers he may have been more-than-somewhat responsible for her former husband's death and she leaves him.
