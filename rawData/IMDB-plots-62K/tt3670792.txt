One year removed from their two year relationship, Abby and Ryan spot each other on the sidewalk for the first time since they broke up. A wave of memories and emotions begin to crash over them as they reflect on the time they spent together and what lead to things between them falling apart. As days pass, the pair begin to wonder if they'll ever be that happy again, and whether it's possible to recapture the love that they once shared. 'Learning to Ride' is an honest look at relationships, first love and how sometimes, love means letting go.
