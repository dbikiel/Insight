Carmen is a Spanish emigrant in Stockholm who does not have the money to run her business or buy a ticket back to Spain. Thanks to a misunderstanding she meets Dr. Petersen who has an invitation to a medical congress in Seville and does not plan to attend. Carmen uses the ticket and impersonates the doctor just enough time to get to the city, but then she will be forced to keep the lie.
