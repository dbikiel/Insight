Apple and Ridley Scott presented the most awaited event of 1984: the introduction of Apple Macintosh personal computer to the world. With a concept directly influenced by George Orwell's classic novel "Nineteen Eighty-Four", Scott offers a heroine who destroys the repressive present led by the Big Brother in order to bring a future full of new perspectives.
