After a career criminal is recaptured and knows he faces the guillotine, he offers to exchange his life for 100 hostages slated for execution by the Nazis.
During WWII, in France, Jean Picard is a criminal who is about to be executed via the guillotine, but an air raid interrupts it and allows him to escape. Inspector Bonet tracks him down and brings him back. But along the way, they hear that a railway bridge vital to the Germans has been destroyed, supposedly by allied agents. The Germans take 100 Frenchmen and are threatening to execute them unless the saboteurs come forward. Picard who would rather die at the hands of the firing squad as opposed to the guillotine, offers to go to the Germans and say that he is the saboteur. Bonet accepts and so they go the village near where the bridge was to learn all that they can so that Picard can convince the Germans that he is the saboteur. While there Picard, a womanizer, meets a young woman and falls in love with her.
During World War II in Nazi-occupied France, Jean Picard is condemned to the guillotine but miraculously escapes when an air raid kills his executioners before they do their duty. Picard was a thief and a forger who was convicted of killing someone during a robbery. Betrayed by his friend Henri Duval, police Inspector Marcel Bonet soon has him in custody once again. While en route to Paris, they learn that 100 French civilians will be executed unless the bomber responsible for destroying a nearby bridge turns himself into the the authorities. When Picard suggests that he could turn himself in and die a more honorable death, Insp. Bonet refuses but he soon relents. With three days until he must turn himself in, Picard lives in the village and falls in love with a beautiful shop girl, Marianne.
