Two lovers attempt to save their relationship in a near-future world on the brink of cosmic collapse.
It's All About Love is the story of two lovers and their attempts to save their relationship in a near-future world on the brink of cosmic collapse. John, and world-famous ice skating star, Elena, are about to sign divorce papers when they realise that, in spite of everything happening around them, their love is worth fighting for. It's All About Love is a fresh take on modern love and future life as two lovers struggle in a conspiracy of epic proportions.
The time is out of joint: it's July, 2021, but snow falls in New York City, people freeze in Uganda, gravity has lost its power in parts of Africa, and hearts give out suddenly. John, an academic on his way to Calgary, stops in New York to meet his wife Elena, a world-renowned skater, at the airport for a quick signing of divorce papers. Instead, she sends bodyguards who take John to her hotel where he catches whiffs of a plot that may place her in mortal danger. Can he trust her brother, Michael? Meanwhile, his own brother, Marciello, circles the globe in a plane observing the onset of global winter. Is there a corner of the world where love is safe?
