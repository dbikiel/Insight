A drama centered around a married couple who opened the first legal brothel in Nevada.
In the mid 1970s, near Reno, Nevada, Grace Bontempo (Dame Helen Mirren) runs the Love Ranch, a legal brothel. Her husband Charlie (Joe Pesci), with big dreams, a felony record, and an aptitude for spending and infidelity, is the brothel's public face. On the day Grace's doctor tells her she has cancer in an advanced state, Charlie takes on new client, Argentine boxer Armando Bruza (Sergio Peris-Mencheta), Charlie's ticket to fame: he hopes to promote a fight with Ali. Because of Charlie's felonies, Grace is Bruza's titular manager. With the I.R.S. and the church ladies circling the business, Grace takes the manager's role seriously and, along the way, Bruza charms her. Secrets play out: is there love at the Love Ranch? How will Charlie respond?
