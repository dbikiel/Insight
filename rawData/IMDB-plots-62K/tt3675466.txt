A look at first-hand video accounts of violence in modern-day Syria as filmed by activists in the besieged city of Homs.
In Syria, everyday, YouTubers film then die; others kill then film. In Paris, driven by my inexhaustible love for Syria, I find that I can only film the sky and edit the footage posted. From within the tension between my estrangement in France and the revolution, an encounter happened. A young Kurdish woman from Homs began to chat with me, asking: 'If your camera were here, in Homs, what would you be filming?'. Silvered Water is the story of that encounter.
A combination of footage shot during the siege of Homs by Wiam Simav Bedirxan, a school teacher who had contacted Ossama Mohammed online to ask him what she should film around her, and Syrians who used their mobile phones and posted their films on the internet, Silvered Water, Syria Self-Portrait is a chronicle of the horrors of the civil war.
