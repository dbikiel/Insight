A young knight sets out to join King Richard's crusaders. Along the way, he encounters The Black Prince who captures children and sells them as slaves to the Muslims. It is Robert Narra's sworn duty to protect the children and lead them to safety.
A very young knight watches his older brother argue with his father over the son's desire to go to the crucades with Richard Lionheart. The arguement is quite nasty and the family is split. The next day the young knight's brother is killed in a small, meaningless battle. The young knight is crushed by it and, feeling that his family is also not welcoming, he runs away. Wandering through midieval France, he ends up in Paris where he finds a large contingent of orphans who are being hunted by slave dealers. He decides that their safety will be assured if he can get them to King Richard. He moves them in a large group toward the last known location of Richard, persued by the slave dealers.
