The 2 front runners for their party's presidential nomination, one principled and the other ruthless, vie for the former President's endorsement.
Intellectual William Russell and down-to-earth Joe Cantwell are front runners for a party nomination that will almost certainly mean the Presidency. Cantwell is prepared to use anything to achieve his goal while Russell sees himself as a man of principle - though his philandering means he is relieved his wife is prepared to appear alongside him. Both men crucially need the support of the ailing President, and as the stakes become higher each team has to decide how dirty they are prepared to get.
It's convention time and front runner Secretary of State William Russell (Henry Fonda) finds himself pitted against Senator Joe Cantwell (Cliff Robertson).Russell is a man of conviction and hopes to elevate politics beyond the personal attack. Cantwell is a political street fighter who practices a "means justifies the ends" strategy, willing to crush any opponent.For ex-president Hockstader it's Russell's inability to act that's his flaw. Russell, a man of conscience, sees too many sides to issues, he is paralyzed by analysis. Hockstader, a practical man, is ready to endorse Cantwell.In the end both candidates make discoveries about themselves, one accepts his weakness, one is defeated by his strengths and in the end The Best Man wins.Watch this film and see how little has changed in the 40 years since its production. Especially note the "role" of women!
