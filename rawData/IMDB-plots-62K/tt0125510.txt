A sociology instructor finds her new teaching duties at a private college interrupted by the presence of a killer mental hospital patient.
A patient escapes from a mental hospital, killing one of his keepers and then a University professor after he makes his way to the local college. Next semester, the late prof's replacement and a new group of students have to deal with a new batch of killings.
