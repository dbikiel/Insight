Eleven year old Willy's childhood toy, Gooby, comes to life as a real, live, six-foot tall monster who helps Willy through rough times, with hair-raising and hilarious adventures.
Imagine if you'd had a six-foot tall monster to help you through the rough times when you were 11!
Willy is terrified about moving into the family's new house. He's convinced it's filled with evil space aliens out to get him. In response to his wish for someone to save him, Gooby comes to life as a loveable, full-size, scraggly, orange, furry creature who in fact seems more frightened of the world than Willy. The two have hair-raising adventures and learn something about the power of friendship. In the end, Gooby fulfills Willy's initial wish by bringing Willy and his dad together in a touching and exciting climax.For kids, there are few things scarier than moving into a new house and knowing that monsters are under the bed. Poor Willy (Matthew Knight, THE GRUDGE 2) has both of these things to fear when his family finds a new place. But luckily, Willy has Gooby (voiced by Robbie Coltrane), a loveable live teddy bear whose size and fears dwarf Willys own. With Goobys help, the boy may be able to survive and thrive in his new environment. GOOBY also stars David James Elliott and Eugene Levy. [D-Man2010]
