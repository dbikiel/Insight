A gang of young offenders organizes an unprecedented robbery. Disguised as brothers, during the escape they collide first with real friars, and then with the police.
Under the nose of the unsuspecting Milanese Police, the ambitious young criminal, Sergio, and his gun-toting gang of thieves manage to pull off a spectacular bank heist. In the guise of pious Catholic monks--and with their leather suitcases crammed with cash--the band of robbers find refuge in an abandoned monastery in the middle of nowhere, intent on spending there the next six months; however, an unforeseen complication in the shape of a late-night visit threatens to put a premature end to Sergio's dreams. Until now, theirs was a foolproof plan. Will Sergio's gang get away with robbery, Roman-style?
