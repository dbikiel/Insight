There was a time when Rocky could have it all. He played French chansons and the women just melted. This is long past, but now someone has awoken the spirit of seduction.
Rocky's heydays as a successful womanizer are long gone but the almost-fifty-years-old has yet to fully realize that. When one fine day Thorben shows up on his doorstep claiming to be his son and desperately in need of being shown the ropes with the ladies, Rocky tries to rise to the challenge but fails miserably. Unwilling to accept defeat, the two decide to get professional help in order to get back into the game...with much unexpected consequences.
