After his photojournalist brother gets killed by a white tigress in the jungles of the Sundarbans, Pandit and his team of commandos enter the prohibited core area of the forest to avenge his death.
Uday, a young photojournalist on assignment in the jungles of the Sundarbans, rescues a white tiger cub ensnared in a poachers trap and brings the cub to a small settlement he is based in. Soon, panic among the villagers sets in. In order to bring calm back to the villagers, the forest warden takes the cub away.
The Royal Bengal Tigress enters the village in the night searching for her cub. She picks up the scent of her cubs blood and reaches the photographers hut. When she fails to get her cub back, her instinct leads her to avenge the kidnapping. She unleashes her wrath upon Uday, kills him, and disappears with his body.
Enters Pundit; captain of an elite commando team, who comes to the Sundarbans to claim his brother Udays body. Silent replies from the villagers leads Pundit to a confrontation with the park warden. She callously declares the case closed and refuses to send a party to recover Udays body as the expanse and dangers of the forest ecology are too complex. Angry and emotional, Pundit decides to deal with the matter himself. He calls upon his own crack commando team and with the help of a local guide Madhu they engage a known tracker, Jhumpa, and set off on a do-or-die mission to capture and kill the white tigress.
The team's quest leads them deep into the marshy heartland of the Sundarbans where they see things only heard of before in old folklore.
Yet sharp and intelligent, the white tigress not only eludes them every time but also manipulates them into her territory. Adding to their predicament, a villainous poacher Bheera senses an opportunity to serve his own interest. He schemes a plan to use the survivors as bait to trap his prize catch, the Royal Bengal White Tigress. But little do they know that the hunters are soon going to become the hunted.
