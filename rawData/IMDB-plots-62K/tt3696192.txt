A lazy youth failing to take up any responsibility is sent to work with his father's friend in Goa where he meets a woman who has problems of her own.
Raftaar Singh (Akshay) spends his days whiling his time away dancing and jumping through fire hula-hoops at fairs in Bassi Pathana in Punjab. While his father (Yograj Singh) is tired of his ways, his mother (Rati Agnihotri) caters to his appetite with home-cooked jalebis, before the former asks Raftaar to choose a path for himself. Either get married to a certain Sweety, or move to Goa and work under his father's friend. Considering the first option unimaginable, Raftaar chooses the second.
