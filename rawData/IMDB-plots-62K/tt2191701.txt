Another three years have passed since the events in Grown Ups (2010), and a now successful Lenny returns to his hometown of Stanton with his family, to reconnect with the old team. As the life-long friends increasingly realise that they are not getting any younger, a new set of challenges arise in the form of unforeseen reunions; familiar bullies; the possibility of a new baby, and the unstoppable threat of a raucous gang of hormone-crazed college fraternity boys. This summer, Lenny, Eric, Kurt, and Marcus will have to try twice as hard to overcome the persistent midlife crisis; however, will the boys ever grow up?
The all-star comedy cast from Grown Ups returns (with some exciting new additions) for more summertime laughs. Lenny (Adam Sandler) has relocated his family back to the small town where he and his friends grew up. This time around, the grown ups are the ones learning lessons from their kids on a day notoriously full of surprises: the last day of school.
