A hoodlum faces challenges from a rival gangster and local police after falling in love and deciding to go straight.
Gemini (Vikram) is a hoodlum, who lives off extortions and petty crime. A brief love affair with the new girl on the block (Kiran), leads him on a path to reform, which ultimately pits him against the local goon Teja (Kalabhavan Mani).
Chenni-based Gemini is a career criminal and extortionist, who often gets into violent clashes with his rival, Teja/Anees. While intervening on behalf of an auto-rickshaw drive, he meets with Marwari belle, Manisha Natwarlal, and both fall in love with each other. He conceals his background, and even enrolls himself in an evening college so they can be together. His cover is exposed when he is arrested by the new Director General of Police, Sengupermual. He manages to convince the Police as well as Manisha's extended family that he will abandon his criminal ways, but faces challenges when the past comes to re-visit in the shape and form of Ganga; Sengupermual gets transferred, and his replacement joins forces with Teja to ensure that Gemini does not survive.
