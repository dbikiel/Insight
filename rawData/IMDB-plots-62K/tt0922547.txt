A horror-thriller centered on a woman (Wilson) suffering from a medical condition that causes her to sleep her life away, waking briefly on rare occasions.
In "Parasomnia," a stylish horror/thriller from director William Malone ("House on Haunted Hill," "Masters of Horror,") Laura Baxter is a young woman, literally a "sleeping beauty," who suffers from a medical condition called "parasomnia." A childhood accident victim, she is actually sleeping her life away, awakening briefly on rare occasions. Art student Danny Sloan falls in love with her, unaware that her hospital neighbor, a terrifying mass murderer and mesmerist named Byron Volpe has other, more sinister plans. Sloan helps Laura escape from her hospital prison only to discover that Volpe is about to enter her dreams.
While visiting his friend Billy in the rehabilitation center of a local psychiatric hospital, the arts student Danny Sloan decides to visit the serial killer Byron Volpe. Byron, a deranged hypnotizer, used his ability to control his victims. He was arrested, wearing a hood to cover his eyes, and is now in a cell in the end of the corridor. When he passes by the room of Laura Baxter, he becomes fascinated with her angelical beauty and discovers that she has Parasomnia (the Sleeping Beauty syndrome), sleeping most of the time and awaking briefly on a few moments only. Billy visits the girl in other occasions falling in love with her; when he finds that she will be transferred to serve as experiment in a clinic with bad reputation, he decides to abduct Laura and bring her to his apartment. However, Byron also loves Laura and controls her nightmares, and uses his power to bring her back to him in a trail of blood.
