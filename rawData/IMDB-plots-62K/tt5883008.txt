When a successful, but tired Tokyo-based playwright who has sworn off easy women and casual encounters takes refuge in the countryside, his plans are disrupted by a horny woman who pedals fast into his life and is unrelenting.
The playwright Kosuke (Tasuku Nagaoka) has withdrawn from the world and women. He leaves Tokyo and starts to live alone in the forest. One day he runs into the sexual free spirit Shiori (Yuki Mamiya). She immediately sets her mind to sleep with him. He refuses and sends her away. This refusal provokes her, and she challenges him to a sexual showdown. Through targeted provocation and subsequent refusal she ignites his desire. An erotic duel arises in which each of the two wants to gain the upper hand.
