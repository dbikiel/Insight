"Americano" centers around Chris McKinley, a recent college graduate backpacking through Europe who savors his last three days of freedom before boarding the career fast track back in the United States. In Pamplona with two friends, Chris meets an Australian thrill-seeker, a quintessential Spanish beauty and an enigmatic provocateur, all of whom encourage him to rethink his life. As the minutes and seconds until his departure tick away, Chris struggles with an age-old question: Should he follow the beaten path or risk it all on the road less traveled?
With the running of the bulls at Pamplona in full swing, a young American encounters a string of people who encourage him to rethink his future: Does he want to return home for the promise of a fast-track career, or is he cut out for a different life?
