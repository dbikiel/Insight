When ordered by his father to avenge the death of his older brother, a young man questions the tradition of violence between two rival families.
The Brazilian badlands, April 1910. Tonho is ordered by his father to avenge the death of his older brother. The young man knows that if he commits this crime, his life will be divided in two: the 20 years he has already lived and the few days he has left to live, before the other family avenges their son's death. He is torn between fulfilling his ancestral duty and rebelling against it, urged by his younger brother Pacu. That's when a tiny traveling circus passes through the vast badlands where Tonho's family lives.
In the desert landscape of the Brazilian Northeast, when ordered by his father to avenge the death of his older brother, a young man questions the tradition of violence and non-stop killing between two rival families.
