The year is 2265, and there exists a restaurant on a galactic road that connects Earth and a Space Colony.
The primary story follows a day in the lives of Noa and Noe, a husband and wife couple that run Sand Sand 33, a chain operated burger restaurant that has seen better days. Situated along space route 246666, the interstellar expressway no longer has the traffic it once had, and customers to the Sand Sand 33 are few and far between, giving cause for Noa to file for reassignment back to earth. Meanwhile his wife Noe has been secretly planning a renovation, and alien contractor she wants to hire has affections for her. One day, Noa's ex-girlfriend and her alien husband drop in.
