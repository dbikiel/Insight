Bugs heckles a black hunter and escapes from a bear.
The cartoon opens with a slow-witted black hunter saying "I'm gonna get me a rhaaa-bittt!" He sees rabbit tracks that lead him straight to Bugs Bunny's hole. Bugs heckles the hunter by telling him which way the rabbit went, luring him into a bear cave (phewww!), followed by bullets following Bugs from hole to hole. Will he ever catch that rhaaa-bittt ?
