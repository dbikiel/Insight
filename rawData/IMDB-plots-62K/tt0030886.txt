Prep football star Jimmy Howal gets a reception far different from what he expected when he enters West Point. His cocky attitude earns him the enmity of many upperclassmen, especially hot-tempered southerner Brandon Culpepper, who also sees Howal as a rival for beautiful Toni Denby, daughter of West Point officer Colonel Denby. Just before the Army-Navy football game, Howals' name is posted as failing French, and the cadets fear he will be kept from playing because of it. (The Paramount writers overlooked the fact that since Howal was a plebe nee freshman student, he couldn't have played anyway as freshman weren't eligible for the varsity in this period.) Toni agrees to tutor Howal, but she, unknowingly, uses an old examination which Is the basis for the new test. Howal realizes what has happened when he passes the exam with flying colors, and suspects Toni of having set out to make a fool of him.
