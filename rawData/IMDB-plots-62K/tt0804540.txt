Daniel, the driver of a very special taxi in Marseille, gets a famous soccer player to the stadium in time and later helps his clumsy police friend Émilien catch the dangerous Belgian after he escaped on Émilien's guard.
Unlucky, clumsy, charming Marseille PD detective Émilien Coutant-Kerbalec must assist worse-than-Clouseau commissioner Gibert guarding a Belgian criminal reputed as dangerous as - and caged like Hannibal Lector. Émilien's cool friend, taxi driver Daniel Morales, initially only agrees to babysit both their buddy-sons, as Émilien's wife Petra is away on top-secret mission. But soon the Belgian escapes, and while chasing him the mates stumble on a bank robbery and a drug king's palatial villa, where the grand finale reeks havoc.
A Belgian criminal, wanted all over Europe for his crimes, is in the custody of the Police Department of Marseille to be watched for a few hours before transfer to a prison in Congo. Unfortunately Émilien (Frédéric Diefenthal) is tricked by the villain and convinced to let the prisoner go. After these events he's fired but luckily for him his friend Daniel (Samy Naceri) helps him one more time telling him the location where the criminal is located, having been the taxi driver who drove him after he left the police station, not knowing he was a criminal. After this Émilien gets his old job back by telling the commissioner where to retrieve the criminal. He's then captured and taken to jail.
