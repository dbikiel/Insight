Unemployed cowhand Jim Garry is hired by his dishonest friend Tate Riling as muscle in a dispute between homesteaders and cattleman John Lufton.
When a shady-looking stranger rides into town to join his old friend it is assumed he is a hired gun. But as the new man comes to realise the unlawful nature of his buddy's business and the way the homesteaders are being used, the two men draw apart to become sworn enemies.
Unemployed cowhand and one-time rancher Jim Garry answers his friend Tate Riling's call to help him out in a dispute between a group of homesteaders and cattle rancher John Lufton. What Garry learns is that his old friend has cooked up a scheme with the local Indian agent to cancel Lufton's contract to supply beef and then buy his cattle at rock bottom prices. Garry also concludes that he's fighting on the wrong side and decides to help out Lufton and his family.
Texan Jim Garry responds to a summons from his old pal Tate Riling in New Mexico to aid him in a cattle project in which old John Lufton is to be the victim. Jim has an encounter with Lufton's fiery daughter, Amy, in which they exchange shots. In town, Jim finds that Riling needs him as a gunman in the event there is resistance by Lufton and his ranch hands to the scheme in which Jake Pindalest, the government's Indian Agent, is to force Lufton's cattle herds off of the government range so that Riling can buy them at a low price. Jim dislikes the set-up, especially the use of Lufton's other daughter to tip-off her father's plans, and an attempt to assassinate the old cattleman. Jim foils that. In a skirmish between cowhands and homesteaders, set-up by a Riling ruse, the son, Fred, of an old-timer, Kris Barden, is killed and Jim declares himself through with Riling, and starts home for Texas. But Riling and a murderous henchman follow him to a meeting with Barden at a remote tavern.
