Robert Wilson leads safaris on the Kenyan savanna. On this occasion, he takes Mr. and Mrs. Macomber out to hunt buffalo. The obnoxious ways of Margaret Macomber make the three of them get on each others nerves. During the hunt Francis Macomber is shot by his wife. An accident or an attempt to get rid of Francis?
Francis and Margaret Macomber go on safari in East Africa and hire professional big game hunter Robert Wilson to be their guide. The Macombers marriage is not a happy one and Francis for his part hopes the trip will bring them closer together. When it comes to hunting the animals, Francis isn't very steady and runs away like a frightened child when he's charged by a lion. His wife is deeply embarrassed and she takes every opportunity to denigrate him for his act of cowardice. She's also taken an immediate liking to Wilson, who stayed calm and cool throughout. When Margaret shoots her husband, she and Wilson return to Nairobi where Wilson has to decide exactly what he will tell the police.
