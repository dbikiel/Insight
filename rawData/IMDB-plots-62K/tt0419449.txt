A deadly car crash sets off three parallel stories of women at crisis points, faltering behind the doors of the same, plain Vienna apartment block. A bored nurse with a stable, comfortable family life has a wild but almost-wordless extramarital affair with a fashion-conscious traveling salesman, who's obsessed with sex photos. An unstable young Austrian grocery checker lies to hold on to her philandering Yugoslavian boyfriend, claiming she's pregnant. Finally, a recent divorc√©e whose violent, ex-husband is a King of Denial intent on getting her back. Will the residents' fibs and moral failures save or destroy them ? Can the women safely express their fears ?

He would try to prove to Nicole that he has changed and that he would treat her with more respect, promising her not to hurt her again. His lies are exposed when he attempts to convince Nicole about being the perfect husband; this does nothing but put her in emotional distress and fears when in her apartment he forces her to listen to him. He tries hard to portrait a good image, but he is betrayed by his unpredictable personality, to the point of being violent towards her. That same night Marco went to see her and Alex confronted him punching him on the face. She would make him leave threaten him with calling the police.
