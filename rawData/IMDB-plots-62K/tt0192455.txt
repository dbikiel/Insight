A small New Mexican village discovers a severed hand that is considered a miracle of God, when it actually belongs to a murdered spouse with a husband in search of it.
Woody Allen plays Tex, a kosher butcher. Sharon Stone plays his unfaithful wife Candy. Tex catches Candy in the act and in a fit of rage he kills her. To conceal his crime he cuts up her body and buries it in the desert in New Mexico. However, when her hand surfaces, a blind woman trips over it and it restores her sight. The hand is then considered to be the "hand of the Virgin." Despite the church's fallen priest objecting, the ambitious mayor of the town creates an international three-ring circus of miracle-seekers, TV crews, and born-again local prostitutes all interested in the hand. All of this goes on while Tex is desperately trying to recover the hand before the sheriff finds it and uses it as evidence against him.
American-born Tex Cowley is a average-looking male who operates a butcher-shop for a living. Despite of his looks, his wife, Candy, is gorgeous, and he is smitten with her. His world crashes around him when he sees her with another male, a police officer by the name of Bobo. After a confrontation, he kills her. Then using his meat-shop knives, he slices her up, puts her remains in the back of his pick-up truck, and buries her remains in the New Mexico desert, little realizing that some parts of his former wife's anatomy had fallen from the truck, and one part, her hand with the middle-finger raised in salute, will soon be displayed in a church-yard, miracles will occur, and Candy's hand will be worshiped as the hand of the virgin Mary.
