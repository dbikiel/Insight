After losing the love of his life to a cruel Philistine prince, a young Hebrew with Supernatural strength defends his people, sacrificing everything to avenge his love, his people, and his God.
A Hebrew with an unusual gift of strength must respond properly to the call of God on his life in order to lead his people out of enslavement. After his youthful ambition leads to a tragic marriage, his acts of revenge thrust him into direct conflict with the Philistine army. As his brother mounts a tribal rebellion, only Samson's relationship with a Philistine seductress and his final surrender - both to the Philistines and to God - turns imprisonment and blindness into final victory.
A narration tells us how the Hebrews had done wrong and were thus put in the hands of the brutal Philistines. The Philistines are collecting food from Hebrews. In the back, Samson, a Hebrew from the tribe of Dan and his brother Caleb are attempting to steal food while Samson is telling riddles. However, they get caught and are chased through the city by Philistine soldiers. In the meantime, Prince Rallah of the Philistines kills a Hebrew named Tobias for asking for more food. When Samson and Caleb come home, his parents urge Samson to fight back against the Philistines since he was chosen to do so from birth. However, Samson prefers peace and is reluctant to do so..
