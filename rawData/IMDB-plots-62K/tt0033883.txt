A man's marriage suffers when he pretends to be a bachelor while promoting "his" best-selling book about married life (actually written by an eccentric professor) in order to pay off a debt to a gangster.
Randolph Haven (Robert Young), an irresponsible sort, and his wife Norma (Ruth Hussey), have been married for seven years and still very much in love, although Norma is dissatisfied with their hand-to-mouth life style and gets a job as a saleslady. Randolph, seeking an easier pursuit, goes into partnership with a bookie and, in order to cover a bet, sells a manuscript on "The Psychology of Marriage", a situation that is fraught with problems, not the least being in that he didn't write the book, and that he also has to pose as a bachelor. He begins to believe in his fake personality to the extent he insists on living in a penthouse. Then the publisher falls in love with Norma, not knowing she is married to Randolph, the bachelor expert on marriage.
