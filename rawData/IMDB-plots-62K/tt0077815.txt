Times change - the characters change. But how often do we return to the brave and noble musketeers, to D'Artagnan and Cyrano de Bergerac, playing on stage or in life. The protagonist is the eighth-grader Petya Kopeikin, "the notorious hooligan" - according to the expression of the teacher, breaks the school play "Cyrano de Bergerac" because he does not like the appointment of classmate-upstart Fyodor Lastochkin for the role of Cyrano. From this event begins the story of "a la Cyrano" between Kopeykin and Lastochkin.
