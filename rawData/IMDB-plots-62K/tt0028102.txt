Jim's father wants to marry Eugenia, but her sister Netta refuses to allow it. When Jim sees Ann at a club, he falls for her even though she is with Lord Priory. He meets her the next day at the riding path, but she quickly loses him. He searches all over for her, not knowing that his father's fianc√©e is her Aunt. As his caricature work suffers as he searches, he is fired from his paper. But he makes a comeback with the comics 'Rags to Riches,' which is based upon the aunt's family. This upsets them so much that they go back to New York, and he follows, being careful not to let them know that he is the one who draws the strip that parodies them.
