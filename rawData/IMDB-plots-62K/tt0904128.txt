After silver spoon Geoffrey tricks arranged socialite date Diana Riggs into dumping waitering commoner lover Percy, she seeks revenge on all boys. So she convinces her private prep school, the only local one for girls, to limit prom dates to the winners of an exhausting competition between Geoffrey's rich jocks school Lancaster and Percy's more modest nerds school Selby. Failing to talking either school out of the whole war, Percy refuses to be bought by Geoffrey and proves a worthy adversary in a ruthless war between horny hordes, which Diane's herd is determined to fire on further. The principals have a feud and agendas of their own. After the close result follows a final twist.
The graduating class at Miss Aversham and Miss Cronstall's School for Girls find that they have - in defiance of the natural laws of probability - all blossomed simultaneously. Capitalizing on their unique status, and intent on teaching high school boys to NEVER take girls for granted, they issue a challenge to the boys of Easthill's rival private schools, Selby and Lancaster. The winner in a series of designated competitions will be awarded exclusive rights to the girls as prom dates. Like the capricious and meddlesome gods of Greek mythology, the ACS girls pit the boys' schools against each other in a (secret) Prom War.
