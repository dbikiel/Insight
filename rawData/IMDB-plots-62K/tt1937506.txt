A former NCAA champion wrestler, paroled after ten years in prison, agrees to a series of cage fights to save a friend's life and is asked to do the impossible - lose.
An attempt to purchase beer becomes a nightmare for underage friends Chase, Jake and Dillon when Chase ends up dead, Jake gets shot in the back, and Dillon - a championship wrestler - goes to prison for manslaughter. Released after ten years, Dillon's greeted by Jake, who lines him up with a job and introduces him to the world of minor league MMA fighting. Due to Jake's outstanding gambling debt, Dillon agrees to three fights to cover it and literally save Jake's life but finds himself caught between gangsters, dirty cops, a shady promoter, a snide parole officer and Jake's disapproving sister.
