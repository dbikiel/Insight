Adam Green's "Aladdin" is a hyper-sensory, poetic, and humorously modern take on the Arabian Nights Classic tale. Revolving around Aladdin's dysfunctional family, who live in an "average" American city ruled by a corrupt Sultan with a decadent socialite daughter, the film explores themes of technology, government repression, greed, and true-love.
A hyper-sensory, poetic, and humorously modern take on the Arabian Nights Classic tale. Shot entirely on papier mache sets like a Jodorowsky film made out of cardboard, the film revolves around Aladdin's dysfunctional family, who live in an 'average' American city ruled by a corrupt Sultan with a decadent socialite daughter. When Aladdin finds a 3-D printing lamp, we are taken on a journey that explores technology, government repression, greed, and true-love.
