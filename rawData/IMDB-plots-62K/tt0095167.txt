Moscow. A typical Russian family. They decide to take home Maya's father: an aborigine who lives in the desert and has never seen any modern comfort, neither speaks the language. Once living in their apartment, the old man begins to act in a strange way, adoring the refrigerator and the pipelines as if they were gods.
A story of a Moscow's apartment building that is slowly falling apart, literally. First, the hot water has been cut off by an old man from Asia, who could not stand it being wasted. Then the roof is starting to collapse. Finally, the electricity has been cut off. All the tenants of the building, no matter how different they were, find themselves in the same situation.
