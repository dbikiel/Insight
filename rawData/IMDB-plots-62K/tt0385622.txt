When a hostage situation arises on a private plane with the daughter of a billionaire on board, Major John Masters (Sabato Jr.) teams up with Captain Williams (Michael Par√©) to stop the terrorists and land the plane.
A private flight for a billionaire's daughter and her friends becomes a frightening ordeal when the plane is overtaken by a team of terrorists, plotting to hold the billionairess hostage. But there is one thing the hijackers didn't count on - Major John Masters, who is also on board. Within a matter of minutes the situation spirals out of control, resulting in a wounded pilot, several dead, and a severely damaged plane. Now, Masters must somehow land the plane on a small Pacific island despite a category five hurricane if they hope to survive-that is if Captain Williams and his team can finish the runway in time.
