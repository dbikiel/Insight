An American junior diplomat in London rents a house from, and falls in love with, a woman suspected of murder.
When William Gridley arrives from the US in London, he rents part of Carly Hardwicke's house from her and promptly begins to fall in love. Gridley doesn't know that many people think she killed her husband but his boss, on the American embassy staff, knows and doesn't take this "lapse of judgment" lightly. Since Carly is also American, Gridley saves his job by introducing her to his boss, who is promptly smitten and promises to help her. So when a Scotland Yard detective arrives, wanting to get to the truth one way or another, they say they'll help him. And then the comedic complications really begin.
Bill Gridley has just arrived in London to take up his post at the U.S. Embassy. He's also found what he thinks is the perfect apartment: reasonable rent, a fashionable address and a very pretty landlady in the form of Mrs. Carly Hardwicke, whose husband seems to be absent. Unbeknown to him, Carly is under suspicion of having killed her husband. When his boss Franklyn Ambruster realizes what he's done, he contacts Scotland Yard and they press Bill to report on her activities. He takes her out to dinner and causes quite a stir as Carly is easily recognizable, having been recent fodder in the tabloid press. They're clearly falling in love but she is worried about the effect the bad publicity might have on him. Bill doesn't give up so easily.
