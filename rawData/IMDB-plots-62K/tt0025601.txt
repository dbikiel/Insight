Mary Barrett is an aspiring Opera singer who is taken under the wings of a famous operatic maestro, Guilio Monterverdi. After spending endless working hours together and arguing, their relationship develops into love. But, jealousy and misunderstandings prevent Mary and Guilio from acknowledging their true feelings.
Despite losing a radio opera singing competition - the winner to train under renowned Milan-based vocal coach Guilio Monteverdi - Mary Barrett decides to move to Milan anyway to pursue her dream of an operatic career. By happenstance, Monteverdi hears Mary sing and does take her under his tutelage. He insists that she live with him solely as his singing protégé. He states that there is no romantic innuendo intended in his offer. Theirs is a rocky relationship. He is a stern teacher and disciplinarian, but under his methods, she does become a great operatic singer, however one that still does require his support and guidance. Despite their initial proclamations to the contrary and Mary's relationship with Bill Houston, Mary and Monteverdi do fall in love. However, Monteverdi's disgruntled ex-student and ex-lover, Lally, will do whatever she needs to break them up, both professionally and personally.
