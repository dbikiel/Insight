TIGER gets what she wants. VANILLA does not know what she wants. Apart from one important thing: a uniform. TIGER teach her to bite, and VANILLA tastes blood. So TIGER needs to learn a new rule: They sow the wind and reap the whirlwind.
Having failed to get into the police force, Margarete takes up training as a security guard. One night she runs into a sexually aggressive ex-colleague who insists on hailing a taxi to take her home to his place. Enter Tiger: short brown hair, a tough girl and a fighter, the cab driver. Realizing that the situation is far from consensual, Tiger speeds off with Margarete, leaving her companion standing in the street. It won't be the last time she rushes to Margarete's aid. Tiger lives in an attic flat with two men. She knows how to wield a baseball bat. Stealing a uniform from security and renaming Margarete 'Vanilla', she begins to steer her life in a completely different direction.
