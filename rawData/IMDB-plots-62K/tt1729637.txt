The daughter of a wealthy nobleman secretly falls in love with her bodyguard.
Reading from a diary, a lad comes to know about a nobleman from Jaisinghpur, Sartaj Rana, who invited the wrath of the Mhatre brothers, Ranjan and Vikrant, by sending Lovely Singh to free abducted women bound for Thailand. Feeling threatened, he hires Lovely as a bodyguard for his collegian daughter, Divya, and her friend, Maya. Divya does not appreciate being followed around by Lovely and creates a fictional woman, Chhaya, who distracts him by repeatedly phoning him and telling him that she loves him. Lovely believes this person to be real and falls in love. In a bar, Ranjan's brother attacks Divya and is killed by Lovely - setting into motion a chain of events that will pit Lovely not only against the enraged Mhatre brothers but also against Sartaj himself, who believes that Lovely is attempting to elope with his daughter.
