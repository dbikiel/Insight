Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak is a true war hero and beloved husband and father. Anna, the wife of his best friend, becomes the love of his life. The revolution in his heart mirrors the revolution in his own country. His destiny is to fight the Bolsheviks and bring back the Czarist rule.
Admiral is a historical fiction film set in Russia during the time of the 1917 revolution. The plot centers on Admiral Kolchak, a WWI war hero and naval commander who played an important role in the February Revolution and the ensuing Russian Civil War. Kolchak's physical participation in the fight against the Bolshevik regime is emotionally paralleled by his relationship with Anna Vaselivna, the wife of his best friend. Their journies beautifully intertwine to create a romantic image of the White Army and the Provisional Government while vivdly portraying all the horrifying details of that tulmultous period in Russia's history. Part of a new movement to revive and honor figures declared "enemies of the state" by the Soviet regime to their perhaps rightful statuses as martyrs and heroes, Admiral is a graceful and glory-filled expression of how the revolution of a heart can become the revolution of a country.
