2 lady truck drivers buy their own rig &amp; try to make a go of it.
After Sweetiepie's husband, who is a trucker, got wounded in a shootout, she has to think up some way to pay the rates for the superliner. Together with a remote friend of her husband, Flatbed Annie (a trucker without a truck), she takes up trucking. What they all didn't know: there is cocaine hidden in the truck somewhere. And not only the bad guys are after it.
