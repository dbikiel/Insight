David Mitchell has recently discovered his inner Lothario, he preying upon the insecurities of women in his game playing to get them to sleep with him. He is not interested in a future with any of these women. He uses these same games as a car salesman at his father Dick Mitchell's dealership to sell cars successfully. David has a stronger bond with his paternal grandfather, eighty-four year old Joe Mitchell, who raised David. David only works for his father, who he doesn't much like, in needing the money to pay for Joe's condo in a seniors community to where he moved follow the death of his wife two years ago. Joe misses his wife as a person dearly but also misses the companionship that she provided in his life. As a promise to his grandmother on her deathbed, David wants to help Joe find that next companion in his life despite Joe not sure if he wants to replace his deceased wife in any way. The only way David knows how to get women is using these games, which may not result in the long term companion Joe would want. In the process, Joe may see the other side of relations with women than as it was with his deceased wife, his sole sex partner. Conversely, Joe tries to convince David that there is more to life with women than one night stands. David may truly understand what his grandfather is telling him when he meets and starts to fall for Julie Larabee, who just happens to be the granddaughter of Rose Sherman, arguably the woman in the seniors community complex to who Joe feels most attracted holistically. David's games may not result in the long term relationship he ultimately admits to himself that he would like with Julie. Other goings-on behind the scenes may affect what happens in both Joe and David's love lives.
