On their way to a concert, a group of teens are diverted by a political protest, only to encounter a family of flesh-hungry psychopaths.
After lying to their parents and running off to see a rock concert, five teenagers leave their suburb neighborhood of Islamabad and travel into the wild only to have their van break down and they get set upon by not only flesh eating zombies, but a ghoulish hitchhiker, and a blood-soaked, burqa-wearing killer.
Five urban Pakistani college youths lie to their elders and trek out from the familiarity of the city to the completely unfamilar rural countryside to watch the "hottest band in Pakistan" but unfortunately their journey takes one turn after another for the worse...and what was supposed to be a pleasure-ride turns into something quite different.
