Open your mind to a horrifying world of cat and mouse as five women and one injured man find terror beyond their wildest nightmares. Marooned on a deserted planet, and picked up by a old derelict spaceship, six unwitting travelers find themselves enslaved in a torture filled blood lust that will take you on a white-knuckle ride into hell. Feel the terror, and ride along if you dare as they slowly fall victim to the horrific appetite of a deranged killer sporting an insatiably blood lust unmatched in an unforgiving universe.
