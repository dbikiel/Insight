The story follows six midshipman after they graduate from Annapolis. Their goal is to become U.S. Navy pilots and three of them are eliminated at the San Diego Naval Base. The remaining three undergo grueling weeks of training at Pensacole Florida, and one crashes. The remaining two get their "wings" and are sent back to San Diego as full-fledged "Sea Hawks", and prepare there for the first Honolulu flight.
Tommy, Steve, Dizzy, Kewpie, Specs and Tex, who spent four years together like brothers as naval midshipmen at Annapolis, have bittersweet thoughts of graduation, the bitter part being possible separation from each other. They all have aspirations to become naval pilots, flying together as a squadron. Most of them do end up as ensigns in aviation selection in San Diego, and then onto aviation training in Pensacola, with those graduating becoming lieutenants and going back to San Diego for the chance to pilot a flight to Honolulu with the rest of the squad accompanying him on the aircraft carrier, Langley. In San Diego, Tommy and Steve meet and both fall for Anita Hastings. Their professional rivalry and early personal rivalry for Anita's affections are generally all in good fun. However, as they both became more serious about her and she about them, the question becomes whether their friendship can withstand the strain, and if that strain will affect their professional relationship, where trust in the sky could mean a matter of life or death.
