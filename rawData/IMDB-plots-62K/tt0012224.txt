A series of adventures begins when an accident during photographing causes Buster to be mistaken for Dead Shot Dan, the evil badguy.
After missing out on a fresh loaf of bread, down-on-his-luck, Buster, finds himself pursued by three policemen hot on his trail. However, to make matters worse, just when the lawless murderer, Dead Shot Dan, is about to have his mug shot taken, an innocent but fatal mistake will put a price on Buster's head. Now, with a "Dead or Alive" poster all over town, Buster will seek refuge in beautiful and sympathetic Virginia's home, only to come face to face with his worst fear. Will innocent Buster ever get off the hook?
Buster is inadvertently identified as the notorious outlaw Dead Shot Dan. He is pursued throughout the city by the local police chief, using disguises and quick-thinking to elude the lawman. He encounters Virginia, a young lady friend, and goes to her home to visit and hide out, only to discover that Virginia's father is the police chief.
