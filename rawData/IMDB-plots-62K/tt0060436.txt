A young woman who's desperately unhappy In get marriage, is tempted into a lesbian relationship with an interior decorator.
The film tells the attentive and meticulous radiography of a neurosis: Piera, a typical wife of Italy of well-being, wife of a spouse to whom she succeeds the social success, protagonist of a "m√©nage" apparently without major problems. The film, partly following the external symptomatology of neurosis, in part recalling the symbolic manifestations and its removed causes from the psychoanalyst's bed, builds by piece the itinerary of an existential discomfort that will end dramatically, despite the psychoanalytic treatment.
