A U.S. Air Force officer tries to stop a murderous group of terrorists who are trying to steal two top secret F-117A Stealth Fighters from the cargo hold of a gigantic C-5 Galaxy Transport flying at 30,000 feet over the Pacific Ocean.
While test flying a stealth-fighter with a new remote control system somewhere over Turkey, Capt. Christopher Winfield encounters problems and must eject from the plane, which subsequently crashes. Capt. Winfield must follow two remaining stealth fighters home to the US in the cargo-bay of a transport-plane flown by Maj. Janet Morgan. There he expects to be court-martialed. A group of terrorists led by a man called Phillips try to high-jack the planes in mid-air, forcing Capt. Winfield to go into action.
