Five people, disillusioned with their lives and passionately opposed to politics, decide to kidnap a politician, to dispense justice and use the ransom money to compensate the family of a victim of an on-the-job worker.
An industrial accident ; a widow ; a few angry workers... Toni is chosen to be their representative on a TV set. But confronted with a minister, he does not measure up to him. After the recording of the show, Toni meets a substitute gym teacher and the two men become friends. They decide to kidnap the minister and hold him to ransom in order to compensate the widow and her family. Ramon, a man recently released from prison, joins them. The kidnapping succeeds... at least at first sight!
