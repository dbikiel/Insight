Helen makes a bet to seduce a man within 3 days in order to get a lead role in a play.
Tired of her social set and their trivial activities and tedious gossip about society divorces and award-winning race horses, Helen yearns for something meaningful in her life. However, Helen doesn't intend to bring forth this new purpose by caring for the sick and starving masses in India, or helping out charities and orphanages. Instead, she decides that the key to her spiritual uplift is to become an actress; so, she vies for the title role in a scandalous new play entitled The Siren.
