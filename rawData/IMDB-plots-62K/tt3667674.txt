A killer drone engages in a high-speed pursuit of a man on a mission.
In a future where cities have crumbled and been reclaimed by nature we join a lone man exploring the ruins of the company Haven Nanosystems. Recovering a locked container he seems to have found what he was looking for, which is information relating to the quarantined Facility B. Unfortunately just as located by a robotic drone and the race to escape is on.
