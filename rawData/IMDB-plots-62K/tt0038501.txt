A snowy scene; Daisy would like a fur coat, so Donald filches a baby bear from its sleeping mother. But the mother awakens and tracks Donald (and her baby) down. Donald uses his own fur coat to disguise himself as a bear cub. The real cub returns, and Donald looks like he might be in trouble, but a jar of honey turns him into the bear's best friend instead.
