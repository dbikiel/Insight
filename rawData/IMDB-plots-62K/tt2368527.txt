Teenage girl Yuna lives on a minor island of Okinawa in Southern Japan. Her island has little technology, no high school and no alternatives to tending to the land or water as a living. Teenagers have to decide to stay and engage the elements or leave for higher education. The island does have a community, however, which comes with a tight-knit culture and idiosyncracies. How to proceed, progress and evolve become matters of conscience, tension, momentum and inertia.
