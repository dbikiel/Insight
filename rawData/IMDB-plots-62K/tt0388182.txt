Charlie has become obsessed with the notion that the long-lost treasure of Spanish explorer Father Juan Florismarte Garces is buried somewhere near their suburban California housing unit.Armed with a metal detector and a stack of treasure-hunting books, Charlie soon finds reason to believe that the gold is buried underneath the local Costco, and encourages Miranda to get a job there so that they can plan a way to excavate after hours.Initially skeptical, Miranda soon finds herself joining in Charlie's questionable antics in an effort to give him one last shot at accomplishing his dreams in this darkly funny, exciting, and surprisingly hopeful take on the modern family and the American dream.
