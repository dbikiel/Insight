"Live at Bimbo's" is the first one-hour stand up special from Natasha Leggero, star of Comedy Central's Another Period and The Roast of Justin Bieber. Filmed at the historic Bimbo's 365 Club in San Francisco, Natasha elegantly examines the many reasons why having kids is problematic, the absurdities of Burning Man, Mormons, Hipsters and more. From conservative Republicans to her very own diamond pussy, Natasha's special proves that no one and nothing is off limits. Even J-Lo.
