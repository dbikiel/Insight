An Iranian couple from the city drive around a remote mountainous region. They hand out bags of money to poor villagers in return for them carrying out unusual requests the couple make of them.
It is clear from this film's explosive opening sequence that there is more to Leila and Kaveh than meets the eye. Armed with sacks of banknotes, the pair are on a mission to donate millions to the needy of rural Iran - whether the targets of their philanthropy want the money or not. The couple's ambiguous relationship shrouds them in mystery, and as we follow them on their quest, it becomes clear that Kaveh's increasingly sadistic nature threatens to overwhelm their good deeds. There are subtle nods to Tarantino's dark humour in this gripping drama, which questions the very nature of charity itself.
"If the answer to the question, Who wants to be a millionaire? seems obvious, its anything but that in the tongue-in-cheek Paziraie Sadeh (Modest Reception), testing how far the impoverished inhabitants of a mountainous Iranian border area are willing to sell out for a fat bag of rials offered by two rich loonies from the city."The Holeywood Reporter (Paziraie Sadeh (Modest Reception): Berlin Film Review)" Buoyed by the central double act of Taraneh Alidoosti and the director himself as a couple of smart urbanites who go to a remote rural area of Iran to give away huge bags of money, this black comedy gets blacker as it proceeds. But it seems ultimately to have little point except to follow the couples Situationist probing of just how far people will degrade themselves for money to its bleak and dramatically unresolved end."-ScreenDaily reviews
