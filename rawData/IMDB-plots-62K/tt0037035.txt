In the early part of this century, Maddelena a teenage Italian girl, is attacked whilst walking in the woods. The attack leaves her mentally scarred and our story flashes forward to the 1940s where Maddelena is still troubled. She disappears one day and her daughter vows to find her.
The teenage girl grows up to marry, have a family and live a respectable, socially acceptable life. EXCEPT, at certain intervals in that life, the early trauma produces amnesia. She is no longer the respectable married woman, but a gypsy possessed by a wild, free-living spirit. The catalyst for these strange interludes is a pair of golden earrings with seven dangling moons.
