Sigmund Freud's newest patient is a vampire fed up with his undying relationship with his wife.
Vienna 1932. One evening Sigmund Freud finds a new patient on his couch. A mysterious Count, burdened by the weight his great existential secret, haunted by the death of a lover 500 years in the past and tired of his eternally long life with his wife. What Freud does not know is that the patient is a vampire. The vain Countess incessantly complains about not being able to look at herself in a mirror, the count tells the professor. Unaware of the fact that the count and his wife are vampires, Freud introduces his mysterious patient to a young painter, Viktor, who paints portraits that express more than a mirror ever could. While visiting the painter, the count takes an instant shine to Viktor's girlfriend Lucy - more so than Viktor and the countess would like.
Trapped in a perpetually unhappy marriage, the dejected but still elegant creature of the night, Count Geza von Közsnöm, decides to pay a visit to the famous psychoanalyst, Sigmund Freud, in melancholic 1932 Vienna. Immortal, still bored to death with his equally eternal wife--the touchy vampiress, Countess Elsa--the neurotic vampire allows himself to surrender into the famous therapist's rug-draped sofa, only to realise that the solution to his persistent problem may lie into the capable hands of the talented young artist, Viktor. But, before long, metaphysical complications will arise in the person of Viktor's bohemian fiancée, Lucy, whose uncanny resemblance to a long-lost love brings shivers down the spine. Usually, all couples swear to love and to hold; however, the thing with eternity is that it's forever. Can the undead couple of Geza and Elsa endure each other for keeps?
