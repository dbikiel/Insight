In 6 AD Emperor Tiberius is warned by the Senate in Rome of the threat posed by the Germanic tribes revolting in the northern province of Pannonia. Tribune Marcus Venditius is entrusted with the insignia of the 7th Legion and ordered by Governor Messala to subdue the rebellion. Magdus, the aging leader of the Pannonian tribes, is angry with Batone because he has compromised the peace terms with Rome, but Batone is a much younger warrior who has lost his reason and lusts for blood.
After the death of Octavian, the rebel populations of Illyria and Pannonia pose a grave threat to the Roman Empire. Tribune Marcus Ventidius is sent to subdue the uprising and, after a bitter battle, captures Pannonian chief Magdus together with a number of women hostages. These include Magdus's own daughter Helen, betrothed to cruel Illyrian warrior Batone who has killed many Romans. Julia, daughter of the Roman governor Messala, is in love with Tribune Marcus and, jealous of his sympathy for the barbarian girl, plots an escape by Helen and her father. Pursuing the fugitives, Marcus crosses a mountain pass where Batone has laid a trap. Marcus thwarts the ambush with Helen's help and, after killing Batone in a duel, gains allegiance from the rebel tribes.
