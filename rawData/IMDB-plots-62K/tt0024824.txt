When Buster's girlfriend falls for a trapeze artist, Buster tries to beat him at his own game.
A man working in a clock repair shop meets a woman who brings in her watch to be fixed. When the watch has been repaired, he personally delivers it to her, and soon after that they go to the circus together. While at the circus, though, the woman becomes attracted to a trapeze artist, and soon there is a rivalry for her affections.
