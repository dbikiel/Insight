Vasyl Seredyuk - head of the local Museum - having sent his daughter Katya to a french university, never expected the outcome: a month ago she informed him that she is getting married to a French heart surgeon Fran√ßois. Since then Vasyl's proud statement spread throughout the whole region: "The Seredyuks have made their European choice!". How huge was his surprise when he saw that the cherished European future son-in-law is a Frenchman of African origin. Organising a wedding so that it never happens seems like a brilliant idea. But when true love stands in the way, the success of such plan is not a given.
