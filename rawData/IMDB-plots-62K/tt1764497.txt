It is a story about different worlds - about a man and a woman, about city and countryside, about future and past. It is also a story about animals and their killers, about deep and short-lived passion and the ancient mystery of woman. It is a story interwoven with visions and light smile, a story about a conventional love triangle and metamorphoses into animals, a story about love as a misunderstanding and misunderstandings created by passion.
MONA is a modern and thrilling drama with erotic and fantasy elements. Told in a stunning and powerful visual language the film is saturated with tension, visions, fantasies, change in humans and humans transforming into animals. Love here is a misunderstanding rather than true feelings, a delusion fostered by passion.
