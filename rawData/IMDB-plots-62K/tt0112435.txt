Seven junior-high-school girls organize a daycare camp for children while at the same time experiencing classic adolescent growing pains.
When Kristy Thomas, president of The Baby-Sitters Club, has a brilliant idea to run a summer day camp, the girls all agree it's the perfect way to spend their summer together. But life gets complicated as budding romance, family problems, and three rival teen girls conspire to ruin the club, all putting the friendships between the members to the test.
A group of friends in junior high decide to start a summer camp for the kids they babysit. However, their plans are constantly changed by complaining neighbors, school rivals, and the ususual growing pains - from passing summer school to dating to reconnecting a relationship with an absentee father.
