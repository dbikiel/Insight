A classic treasure hunt story.
In this film, the animated scenes are interspersed with musical numbers and game scenes shot with the participation of actors and illustrating the events of the animation film or relating to certain problems related to the way pirates live: for example, greed, smoking or alcoholism. At the same time, the manner of filming of musical numbers and game episodes differs in different episodes: somewhere the image is colored, somewhere - black and white. One game scene mimics a silent film using intertitles, and in some episodes live footage is combined with animation.
The schooner "Hispaniola" is sailing in search of an island on which the legendary treasures of the pirate captain Flint are hidden. A conspiracy is brewing on the ship. The robbers, led by the one-legged John Silver, seem to be close to the target.
