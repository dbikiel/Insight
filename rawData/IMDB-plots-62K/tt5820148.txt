Twelve hard months after their sudden break-up, a struggling musician invites his ex-lover at a friend's sumptuous villa in search of answers. Living apart, or living together, is equally scary; but, is there an answer to every question?
It's summertime in Athens and Nikos, a 30-year-old broke musician, is taking care of a luxurious villa in the suburbs that belongs to a friend of his. Between poolside cocktails and fooling around with the dog that he is meant to take care of, Nikos has a plan. Still unable to get over his recent break-up with Sofia, he figures this is a unique opportunity to get some much-needed answers and he invites her over for the weekend. Sofia delightfully accepts not knowing, of course, that Nikos' plans are not as innocent as they seem. Nikos locks himself up in the house with Sofia and refuses to let her leave until she provides some rationale for the break-up, turning their alleged carefree holiday into a mess of games, fights, laughs and introspection. Is Nikos ever going to get the answers he was looking for? Is Sofia ever going to be able to explain why they broke up? Afterlov is a funny, poignant and scathing post-love story between two people who refuse to grow up.
Almost twelve painful months after their sudden break-up, Nikos--a struggling, penniless, and unmotivated thirty-year-old musician--still stubbornly refuses to accept the fact that his intense relationship with the beautiful only-child, Sofia, has come to a close. Slowly succumbing to a hopeless summertime ennui at his friend's sumptuous and silent villa he is supposed to look after, Nikos devises a simple but bold ruse--a hospitable invitation under the pretence of an innocent vacation will lure Sofia into his beautiful prison until he gets the answers he needs. Against the backdrop of a sun-kissed Athens, two immature dreamers are shaking in their shoes by the idea of living apart--or living together--however, is there an answer to every question?
