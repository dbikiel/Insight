Nicky and Tacy are going to be married. Nicky wants to save up money for a house, but Tacy dreams of starting off with their own home on wheels--a trailer. After the two are hitched, they hitch up their trailer and begin their honeymoon. The humor comes from several disastrous adventures the couple has while traveling including Tacy's awkward attempt to cook dinner in a moving trailer, and a cliffhanging ride through the mountains that nearly destroys their marriage.
Before they were married, Tacy Collini convinced her now husband Nicky Collini to purchase a trailer in which to live so that they could be together as he traveled from job to job working on major infrastructure projects, in the process saving money both on rent and on hotel rooms. They could tow the trailer for their honeymoon across the American west to end up eventually in Colorado where Nicky has his next job. The problems start as soon as they reach the showroom floor to purchase the model they were planning, that issue which may be a harbinger of things to come in both their inexperience in anything associated with trailer life, and their differing viewpoints of their life together in a trailer. The question then becomes if their marriage can survive the multitude of problems that arise, all in one one way or another associated with the long, long trailer.
