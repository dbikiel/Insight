Mrs. Suburbanite reads in the morning paper that burglars have been operating in the neighborhood and is, of course, thrown into a panic of fear, which is greatly intensified by her seeing a couple of suspicious characters loitering about outside. She locks the door and hides the key in the window seat, only to see, a few minutes later, the curtains in a state of agitation. She telephones Mr. Suburbanite, "Help! Help! Burglars are breaking in," who, after a wild chase home, finds the cause of the trouble to be a toy poodle playing behind the curtains.
