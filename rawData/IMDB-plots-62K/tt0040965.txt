Legendary railroad detective Whispering Smith becomes convinced that old friend and colleague Murray Sinclair has joined a criminal band to loot the railroad.
Smith as an iron-willed railroad detective. When his friend Murray is fired from the railroad and begins helping Rebstock wreck trains, Smith must go after him. He also seems to have an interest in Murray's wife (and vice versa).
Legendary railroad detective Whispering Smith becomes convinced that old friend and company colleague Murray Sinclair has thrown in with disreputable rancher Barney Rebstock and his cold-eyed psychopathic killer Whitey Du Stang to loot the railroad. Smith suspects that Murray's successful ranch spread owes as much to pilfering railroad property in conjunction with Rebstock as it does to his modest salary as wrecking crew boss. Complicating matters is Sinclair's growing contempt and disregard for his wife and Smith's unrequited affection for her.
