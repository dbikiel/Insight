'I grew up in a bad neighborhood and Kabul is just that; another bad neighborhood' The last international troops will leave Afghanistan by the end of 2014. 38-year old Kimberley Motley has left her husband and her three kids in USA, to work as a defense lawyer in Kabul, Afghanistan. She is the only foreign lawyer, with a license to work in Afghan courts, not to mention, the only woman. With her afghan assistant Khalil, Kimberley defends western and afghan clients, accused of criminal offenses. Money and prestigious human rights cases has motivated her for five years, but the personal threats and the dangerous conditions in the country, makes it harder and harder for Kimberley to continue her work.
