After his students are killed by the One Armed Boxer, a vengeful and blind Kung Fu expert travels to a village where a martial arts contest is being held and vows to behead every one armed man he comes across.
The one-armed boxer is stalked by a vengeful flying guillotine expert, after his disciples were killed in the first 'One-Armed Boxer' film. But as the flying guillotine master is blind, he starts his quest by becoming a serial killer of one-armed men. Meanwhile, the one-armed boxer is running a martial arts school, where he teaches his pupils to control their breath so they can run up walls and along ceilings. And there's an Indian fakir whose arms can extend until they're ten feet long. As you may have gathered, a rational plot summary is pretty pointless - but rest assured there are epic martial arts battles and ludicrously inspired moments galore.
Fu Sing Wu Chi is the blind teacher of the two Ching assassins, Chow Lung and Chow Fu, killed by the One Armed Boxer a few years earlier. He also happens to be a master of the most deadly of all weapons, the flying guillotine. When Fu receives word of their death he immediately heads off to find Liu. Unfortunately, in the process he kills any one armed man in he comes in contact with. Aiding him in his search are a Thai boxer and an Indian fakir, who has the power of extending his arms. Also complicating matters is a Japanese karate expert, who has designs on the daughter of a martial arts teacher who also was killed by the vengeful Fu.
