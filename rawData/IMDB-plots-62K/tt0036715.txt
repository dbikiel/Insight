A demented physician becomes obsessed with a young singer whose voice sounds similar to his late mistress.
Dr. Hohner (Karloff), theatre physician at the Vienna Royal Theatre, murders his mistress, the star soprano when his jealousy drives him to the point of mad obsession. Ten years later, another young singer (Foster) reminds Hohner of the late diva, and his old mania kicks in. Hohner wants to prevent her from singing for anyone but him, even if it means silencing her forever. The singer's fianc√©e (Bey) rushes to save her in the film's climax.
Physician Dr. Holmer exercises a Svengali-like influence over a young singer and prevents her from singing the title role in the opera "The Magic Voice." The last time it was sung 10 years earlier the lead soprano disappeared under mysterious circumstances.
