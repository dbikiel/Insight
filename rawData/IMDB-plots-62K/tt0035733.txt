It's a peaceful day at the local poultry farm until Foxy Loxy happens along intent on a chicken dinner. He takes the advice of a book on psychology by striking "the least intelligent" first and convinces dim witted Chicken Little the sky is falling. Chicken Little spreads the word but when head man Cocky Locky proves the story to be false, Foxy Loxy spreads rumors that Cocky Locky isn't the smart chicken he appears to be, which leads to the ultimate undoing of the chickens at the hands of Foxy Loxy.
In a fenced-in farm community, a gaggle of feathered fowl live, presided over by Cocky Locky. Outside the fence, Foxy Loxy intends to have them all for dinner. However, Foxy is not one to risk his life and end up trapped or shot, deciding instead to try and use psychology to get them all.Grabbing a piece of wood with painted blue with a star on it, the fox drops it on the head of Chicken Little. Whispering to the chicken that a piece of the sky just hit him on the head, the little chicken panics and soon has the entire farmyard in a panic. However, Cocky Locky comes and resolves the issue, explaining that the "piece of the sky" is just a piece of wood.The fox rebounds, and decides to spread gossip and rumor about Cocky Locky, denouncing his position in the community. The fox also whispers to Chicken Little to take command, and both he and Cocky Locky get into an argument regarding if the sky is falling or not. To push the farmyard into a full panic, Foxy throws another blue-painted piece of wood that knocks out Cocky Locky. With the farmyard animals looking to Chicken Little for answers now, Foxy Loxy whispers to the scared chicken to have everyone run to the nearby cave.Foxy Loxy's plan works, and we see him in the end relaxing with a swollen belly, amid a row of wishbones (looking ominously like tombstones).
