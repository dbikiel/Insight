A spoof of typical 1980's teen movies. The idea is that VH1 found a "long-lost", never-released teen film made in the 1980's and decided to air it now in 2006; thus it is loaded with the typical formula, clich√©s, bad fashions, and stereotypical characters found in those movies and makes fun of them.
