A teenage boy's search for love finds him fixated on a boy who lives nearby.
Pim, the emotionally abandoned and affection-starved young gay son of a small seaside town's resident floozy, grows up dreaming intensely of a loving father who will someday come for him, but never does. Frequently home alone, Pim often spends time at a neighbor's house where another single mom and her two teenage children accept him matter-of-factly. As Pim is about to turn 15, he and neighbor boy Gino become each other's friend-with-benefits, entering a period of sexual awakening together. Life, however, is all about change, and while Gino (a couple years older) is ready to move on and move out, Pim is not, leaving Pim behind to carry on with his continuing crush for Gino (while Gino's sister Sabrina develops an unrequited crush for Pim).
Sensitive fatherless Pim, a shy closet gay, grows up as utterly neglected son of Yvette, a hedonistic nightclub waitress at the Flemish North Sea coast. Pim finds solace with the hospitable neighbors, especially slightly older, cocky son Gino, who acts as his generous big brother and even enjoys experimenting sexually, camping in the dunes. Once a major, Gino takes a foxy girlfriend and a job, so he can move out, while his ever-jealous sister Sabrina tries to seduce Pim. Yvette takes in suave gypsy Zoltan, whose kindness and perfect body give Pim new hope, only to find he's his mother's lover. Pim now flees back to the neighbors, but Gino leaves and takes a girl as fianc√©e.
