Male twins are separated at birth and live their lives in different backgrounds - until one gets abducted.
After Kasturi gives birth to yet another still-born child, her mother-in-law, with the assistance of a nurse, switches the dead child with one of two twins that impoverished Indira has just given birth to. The latter names her child Narsingh, who grows up to be a singer/dancer, and falls in love with Anju, the daughter of a DGP. While the second child is brought up by upper caste, Kasturi and Govind, performs poojas at a variety of weddings and funerals, and is in love with Chandrakala. Chaos will enter their lives when Narsingh will be abducted by a gangster, Baba Bhai, and held until and unless his biological father, an Indian Army Major, reveals a secret. Narsingh manages to escape, continues to elude the gangster and his goons. They then manage to hire an unknowing Chari to impersonate him and compel the Major to reveal the secret. The question remains: will naive Chari be able to pull wool over the Major's eyes?
