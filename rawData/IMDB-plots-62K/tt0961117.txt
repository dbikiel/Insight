A documentary that looks to distinguish what's fact, fiction, legend, and otherwise as a camera crew trails Michael Moore while he tours with his film Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004).
Manufacturing Dissent is a topical documentary seeking to separate fact, fiction, and legend. It chronicles Michael Moore on tour during the promotion of Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004), all while exploring the politically charged climate in America that has prompted Moore's ascension from documentary filmmaker to icon of the political left.
This first appeared on realmoviereview.comWhat happens when the hunter becomes the hunted? Michael Moore is known to the movie-going public as a corporate bigwig buster, and the Republican Partys most vocal opponent (at least the most vocal opponent that has never appeared on a ballot). This Canadian-made documentary features a couple of determined filmmakers trying to get an interview with the biggest name in mainstream documentaries. Unfortunately the American champion of the little guy proves to be as elusive as he claimed GM Chairman Roger Smith was in the Moores first feature, 1989s Roger and Me. While the deadly duo is following Moore around the country trying to get a sit down, they are also exposing fallacies that they found in his various films and talking about his professional rise to his current level of wealth and, complete with interviews with friends and business associates, past and present. There is also, of course, ample footage of Moore, himself, from his features, other speaking engagements and encounters with the filmmakers themselves. The attacks upon his work include everything from careful editing to assure that he remains in the forefront and downplaying the efforts of others to outright lies.
