A drama based around a boxing school owner and his son.
Dutchman Lucien runs a boxing gym, as if 'his' kids' future were largely his responsibility. Since his wife and daughter died in a car accident, fro which he needlessly blames himself, he rather neglects sole surviving son Mitchell. The teen knave largely leads his own life, but conflict always lingers. Even the gym folk side with Mitchell when Lucien attacks his son just for wearing a tutu at an informal garden barbecue.
