When a friendly demon helps two guys to meet girls, the portal to hell also lets in a more evil creature that starts terrorizing the town.
Rich and Benny are having trouble with the ladies, until they befriend a demon named Az. It's a non-stop party until a soul hungry beast leaps through an open portal from the underworld and starts terrorizing the town. It's up to Az and the boys to send the creature back to the depths where it came from, and look good, while doing it in "Cool As Hell".
