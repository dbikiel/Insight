A man's life is retold just after his funeral. Beginning as a track walker, Tom Garner rose through all sorts of railroad jobs to head the company. In the meantime he lost touch with his family. When he saw what was happening it was already too late.
The film opens at the funeral of the (seemingly) ruthless railroad magnate, Tom Garner. His life is then revealed: Beginning as an illiterate "track-walker" for the railroad, he met Sally, a schoolteacher, who taught him how to read and write. They married, and Sally pressed Tom to better their lot, insisting on her plan to support him while he continued his education. Then began a steady rise in Tom's fortunes with the railroad. He grew more ambitious, avaricious and scruple-free year by year, brutally crushing labor movements and buying out other railroads. A son was born. Tom and Sally's long marriage became strained, with Sally realizing that the ambition she had instilled in her husband was leading them all to certain disaster.
