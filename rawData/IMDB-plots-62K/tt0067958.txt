A homage to the work of psychologist Wilhelm Reich, matched with a story about a Yugoslavian girl's affair with a Russian skater. Sexual repression, social systems and the orgone theory are explored.
A dense film that cuts up footage of a primary plot of two young Yugoslavian girls, one a politico and the other a sexpot, and an affair with a visiting Russian skater. Mixing metaphors of Russia's relationship with Yugoslavia, intercut with footage and interviews with Wilhelm Reich and Al Goldstein of Screw magazine. The film applies Reich's theories of Orgone energy and analogies of Stalinism as a form of Freudian sexual repression. Also known as W.R. The Mysteries of the Organism in English subtitled version. Was banned in Yugoslavia shortly after it was made.
Part documentary and part fictional film, this effort looks primarily at the importance of free love in a communist society. In the documentary portion, we learn of the life of Dr. Wilhelm Reich who promoted the view that free love was an essential element in a so called classless communist society. Openly communist when it was not safe to be so (he died in the U.S. in 1957) Reich is depicted as a victim of society whose ideas were repressed by the courts and who was generally viewed as someone who was mentally ill. In the fictional portion of the film, the characters endlessly debate Reich views.
Half-documentary about Wilhelm Reich, scientist who tried to bring together teachings of Freud and Marx and was persecuted by Hitler, Stalin and McCarthy. The movie deals with the scientist and with the people who try to put his teachings into practice.
