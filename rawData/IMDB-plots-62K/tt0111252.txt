About to stay a summer internship, promising young medical student, Raymond Aibelli's mother, Susan, breaks her leg. Housebound and immobile, his father, Tom, makes Raymond stay home and take care of her. Susan's a troubled woman, and along with Raymond's own emotional strains, it leads them to intimate physical contact, which Raymond finds uneasy. He soon meets a high school girl, Toni, but his ability to handle starting a relationship with her is difficult, due to the emotionally troubling recent events in his life.
Ray is a promising pre-med student at MIT, home briefly (he thinks) before leaving again for a prestigious internship. His plans evaporate when his callous father insists he stay home to care for his mother after an accident, while the father travels on sales calls. The ensuing days are spent struggling to run the large suburban household alone, masturbate undisturbed, and keep his mother happy. The boredom and Vodka tonics kick their Oedipal urges into overdrive, and the girl next door only adds to his confusion.
