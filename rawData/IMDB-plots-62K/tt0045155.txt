Three young ladies sign up for some kind of training at a naval base. However, their greatest trouble isn't long marches or several weeks in a small boat, but their love life.
Three friends have had too many man troubles. Society girl Whitney Young had planned to marry, but left her fianc√© at the altar. On the other hand, timid small towner Mary Kate Yarbrough was jilted on her wedding day, while brassy Brooklynite Una Yancy hopes to find a husband. They decide to join the WAVES (Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service) in the United States Naval Reserve. They spend ten weeks of training in boot camp, checking out every eligible male and eventually each decides on a sailor to pursue.
