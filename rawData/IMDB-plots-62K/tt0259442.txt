A lesbian private detective dives head first into murder, manipulation and the consuming power of sex.
Jill Fitzpatrick is a 28-year old, street-smart, out-of-work private investigator wishing she wasn't celibate. Eager for the taste of adrenaline, she accepts a job investigating the disappearance of Mickey, a young female student. Jill quickly strikes a spark with the seductive Diana, Mickey's poetry lecturer. But it is not long before Mickey's strangled body is found. Distrusting the cops, Mickey's grief-stricken parents ask Jill to find her murderer. Jill is soon hurled into a passionate liaison with Diana as she enters the surprisingly seamy underworld of Mickey's life, looking for clues to her murder. For whom did Mickey write her sexually charged poems? What is the connection between Mickey and her two favorite poets? Who is leaving threatening messages in verse on Jill's answering machine? Blinded by her passion, Jill is compromised in her search for the truth - until her own life is in danger.
