A black high school senior struggles with becoming a man, and living in a middle class white neighborhood in the late 1950s U.S. In protest of the paternalistic views of the Civil War emphasized in his history class, he storms out and gets caught smoking a cigar in the boys' room. Spence's crush on a white classmate goes nowhere because of her father's attitude toward blacks. His outspoken grandmother seems the only one who understands his angry growing pains, at the early stages of the U.S.'s Civil Rights Era.
Spencer Scott has two problems; he suffers the normal anguish of a teen-ager in the process of growing up with "misunderstanding parents", and he is also a black boy in a predominately-white New England town. He is accepted by his white-boy classmates because of his athletic ability but their parents object to his color. And he is confused about the ambivalence of his parents who teach him to have self-respect for his race but, at the same time, telling him to compromise with his white friends. He is expelled from school for violently protesting his history teacher's remarks about the shortcomings of the black people during the Civil War. He wanders into the black-section of the town and encounters four prostitutes at a bar.
