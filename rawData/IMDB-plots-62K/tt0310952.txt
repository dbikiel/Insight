Hale, an American astronaut dies and is reincarnated with other persons who have lived throughout all of human history and end up on a mysterious planet called 'Riverworld'. The humans are left to their own devices and create tribal fiefdoms and succumb to brutal wars and raids. A mysterious race of hooded 'beings' oversee them - sometimes intervening, but their motives are unknown. Anyone who has ever lived and died on Earth comes here rather than 'the afterlife', even an extra-terrestrial call Monat, who had the unfortunate luck of dying on Planet earth in 2039. Hale leads a revolt and joins with others on a large boat to explore this mysterious new world.
After an astronaut crashes, he finds himself in a rejuvenated body on a Waterworld. He also finds that he is surrounded with souls from many different eras and an alien being that died on Earth in the future. Immediately captured by a ruling group, the astronaut finds himself leading a group fighting for freedom. Also the soul of Nero Claudius has found its way to Riverworld and wants to resume his role as Emperor.
