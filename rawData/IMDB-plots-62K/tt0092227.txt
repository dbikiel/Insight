A woman gets off a train by mistake when it stops at a siding in the middle of nowhere. The only person there is a peculiar man whose job is to switch the trains. He doesn't understand her language and won't speak to her at all, so she quietly waits for another train, but there isn't one. Eventually the winter weather forces her to shelter in his room. She unpacks her things and a wordless relationship begins to form.
