Little Bo Peep has lost her sheep, and that leaves one of them vulnerable to a pack of hillbilly wolves. It's Mighty Mouse to the rescue!
A pack of hungry wolves, with one of them disguised as Little Bo Peep, raids a flock of sheep and captures a little lamb. The wolves' attempt to make lambchops out of the lamb are thwarted when Mighty Mouse arrives to save the day. The superhero mouse singlehandedly thwarts the wolves' dinner plans.
Little Bo Peep has lost her sheep, and that leaves them vulnerable to some hillbilly wolves nearby. One of the wolves dresses as a bosomy Bo Peep (complete with a corset and barbells to simulate a womanly shape) and attracts one of the sheep to the wolves' cabin. It looks as if the poor creature is done for. But the plaintive baaing of the sheep reaches the big, round ears of Mighty Mouse. From his tree-house, the super rodent flies to the rescue. The wolves bring out all their artillery to thwart the powerful pest, but shotguns and cannons are no match for Mighty Mouse.
