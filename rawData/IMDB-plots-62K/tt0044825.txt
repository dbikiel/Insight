The arrival in Las Vegas of a businessman and his glamorous wife creates a complex web of murder and deceit.
Investment broker Lloyd Rollins, insisting to his wife Linda that they stop at Las Vegas on their trip from Boston, begins to gamble heavily. Linda visits the Last Chance, a casino where she used to sing, and where she meets police lieutenant Dave Andrews, with whom she had a brief affair some years earlier. Insurance investigator Tom Hubler soon arrives to keep an eye on Linda's valuable necklace for his company, unaware that Rollins hocked the necklace with Clayton, owner of the Last Chance. Lt. Andrews, rebuffed by Linda, learns that Clayton has been murdered. He deduces the killer's identity and begins a deadly chase when he learns the killer has taken Linda hostage and fled into the desert.
Wealthy Lloyd Rollins visits Las Vegas for some high stakes gambling, ostensibly recreational, with his wife Linda, formerly a lounge singer there. Lloyd's real object soon becomes evident; interested onlookers include Tom Hubler, apparently an insurance investigator...and Dave Andrews, Linda's old flame (now a police lieutenant). Lloyd fails to win the money he needs, and Andrews finds a real case on his hands when a casino owner is murdered...with a wide array of suspects. Climax is an exciting car and helicopter chase.
