A baby wolf is left on the doorstep of the three little pigs, so they raise him as their own.
After another ingenious evil plan fails, the wolves come up with another wise evil plan to capture the pigs. The wolves' plan is to put a baby wolf at their door so that the pigs will bring it in their house and raise it as their own, and then after it grows up it will become a wolf and feel out of place living a pig's life and then at this transitional stage they can befriend the wolf and convince him to leave the key under the welcome mat so they can get in.Well, the baby is dropped at the door, the pigs take him in as planned, and the plan is a go, but can the wolf after all these years bring himself to betray the pigs that raised him as their own flesh and blood no matter what anybody else thought of them?
When the three pigs find a tiny wolf cub on their doorstep, they decide to raise him as their own, unaware that they've played right into the plan of a special-ops team of wolves. As the newest addition to their family, Lucky grows into his teens not knowing his history, his role in the wolves plan or the difficult choice he will have to make about the family that raised him.
