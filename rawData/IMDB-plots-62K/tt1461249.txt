Passions run high when hope for a economically strapped town seems blocked by the investigation of a murdered kid, son of a county commissioner.
Small-town detective Noah Cordin is called to solve a juvenile homicide that occurred during a home burglary in his affluent town of Hilliard. The dead boy's mother, Allison Connor, is a member of the Meskada County Board of Commissioners, and a powerful woman in Hilliard. The entire township of Caswell rallies together in solidarity - not to support her and Detective Cordin's efforts to find the killers (who appear to have come from Caswell) but to keep the way clear for a new business with 500 jobs coming to town.
