A story about fame, addiction and a custody battle over a man's leg.
A man loses his leg in an accident. Another man accidentally buys it at a North Carolina auction. The story only gets stranger from there. This is a rare, truly laugh-out-loud doc. An expertly crafted narrative gets under the skin of lives that are forever changed when a crazy small-town feud becomes a national media circus. The result is both hilarious and tragic. An astonishing, stranger-than-fiction tale of greed, ego and redemption.
