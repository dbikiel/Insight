A sex doll who is both a sexual companion and the recipient of her owner's all-around affection comes to life and becomes self aware. She begins to experience and experiment with life and has so many questions including many when she coincidentally walks into a video store and is hired by the shorthanded manager. She begins to experience and query birth, life and death. In the meantime, her owner is taking his time cluing in to his doll roaming around the city and having a life.
