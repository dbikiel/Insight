A scientist builds a boat after his warnings of an Earth-destroying flood are ignored. But when it's evident the disaster will occur, those who maligned the scientist now turn to him in desperation, boarding the boat and seeking his answers before the world drowns in a never ending sea.
Solar flares knock out satellites and transmission stations around the globe and melt the polar ice cap. This shifts tectonic plates and creates tidal waves which wipe out Bangladesh and the west coast. A scientist realizes that the magnetic core of the planet is weakening. This will weaken the ozone layer and oxygen will escape into the outer atmosphere and make destroy the Earth's protection from another solar flare. So the devastation wrought by the solar flare is a brief preclude to the extinction of life on earth unless our scientist can rally leaders and use the Large Hadron Electron collider at CERN Switzerland in tandem with one in the US to create two black holes able to increase the earth's rotation and stabilize the magnetic core.
He sets off across the Atlantic for CERN in a keelless motorboat with a group of stragglers found floating along the way. The boat starts taking on water and the scientist tells his makeshift crew they'll need to lighten the load. When he suggests they toss some of the unnecessary food; a crew member gets anxious and shoots him but he recovers. Sails to Switzerland now a coastal country but run into a problem, the guard to the laboratory ask whether they speak French, "tu parles francais". Well, our Ph.D. scientist and his crew were so flustered not knowing what tu parles francais means that I thought they were going to turn around and go home. Fortunately, one old man who was deaf heard him and responded in French and the day was saved. Now they could save the world.
