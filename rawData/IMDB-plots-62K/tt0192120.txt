An unrepentant crook enters a dance hall and gets in a fight over a girl. As he, unknowingly, breaks into her house, another bloody mess stains the residence's thick carpets. Can a simple act of kindness pave the way for his regeneration?
A rough criminal gets into an argument over a girl in a dance hall. The argument turns into a fight, and the criminal is shot. As everyone else looks on, a young woman comes to his aid, and it turns out that he is not seriously wounded. He still remembers the woman who helped him when, later, he is committing a burglary and gets a surprise that will change his life.
The outlaw and his pals plot to rob the general store. He goes into the store with the intention of attracting the attention of the storekeeper while the rest of the gang enter from the rear. But the girl is the one who meets him and the outlaw feels a vague desire to reform at sight of her. He calls off the gang and orders them to let the store alone. But they are determined. While he is out of the camp gathering wood for the fire, they plot to overpower him. When he comes back they overpower him and leave him tied while they set out to rob. He frees himself by rolling into the fire and burning his bonds. He sets off in pursuit. He comes upon them in the act of robbing the store, forces them away at the point of his gun and accepts the thanks of the girl. Then he sorrowfully rides away.
After pawning his dirty jewellery to a Chinese pawnbroker, an unrepentant and hard-as-nails crook, enters a noisy and crammed with people dance hall, only to get in a bloody fight over a girl--a concealed weapon and the police are involved, too. Later that night, unknowingly, the thief breaks into the same woman's house with his partner--and before long--another bloody mess stains the residence's thick carpets. However, this time, a stunning and very welcome surprise awaits. Can a simple act of kindness pave the way for his regeneration?
