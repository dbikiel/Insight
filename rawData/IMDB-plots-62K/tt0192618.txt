A teenager wins a fully-automated dream house in a competition, but soon the computer controlling it begins to take over and everything gets out of control. Then teenage Ben must calm the computer named PAT.
A 13-year-old boy wins a computerized house manned by a cyborg maid named PAT. When he and his dad move into the house, he figures that his dad will cease considering re-marrying since the house and PAT can handle all of the cooking and cleaning chores. However, his father soon shows an interest in the computer programmer. This sets the boy into tinkering with PAT's program and setting in motion a too-wife (and mother)-like nagging robot.
Meet the Coopers, an average American family. Meet Dad, a widower. Meet Angie and her older brother Ben, who is the "mom" of the family. The Coopers win a "house of the future" with a cyber-housekeeper, PAT (Personal Appiled Technology). PATs great for throwing parties and making sure the family runs smoothly. But when Dad starts going out with Sara, the person who created the house, Ben programs PAT to act more motherly so his father won't think they need a mother. But the house goes wack and it's up to Sara and Ben to work together to defeat a very Smart House.
