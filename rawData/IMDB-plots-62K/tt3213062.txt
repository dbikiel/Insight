Raging Grannies is a touching and thought-provoking documentary that challenges the idea that we must continue to shop, consume, amass, and keep the economy growing. Armed with courage, humor, a long friendship and a zest for life, Shirley and Hinda take to cities and towns across the US to engage everyone from the recently homeless to university students to growth economists and Wall Street tycoons, questioning the sustainability of continued growth, and demonstrating that it is never - ever - too late to get out and make a difference.
