Dnyanesh and Mukta are siblings who with their mother and grandmother live in the pilgrim town of Pandharpur, Maharashtra. The title's eponymous 'Elizabeth' is a bicycle that is gifted to the talented Dnyanesh by his father after whose death Dnyanesh takes to supporting his mother. The family lives in straitened financial conditions and on the eve of Ashadhi, financial necessity forces Dyanesh's mother to sell Elizabeth to a pawn-shark. Dnyanesh and his group of friends must now find a way to recover Elizabeth which forms the rest of the movie.
The film is Maharashtra's home-grown World Cinema. With an international sensibility but impregnated with Marathi folklore and 'saint culture' this film is a unique offering. At the core of the film are basic human emotions of mother &amp; child and a child's struggle to help his struggling mother financially. Set against the backdrop of a holy town, it is a modern poem on silver screen that explores scientific curiosity of children viz-a-viz the spiritual teachings of the land; such that it becomes a take-away for both parents and children equally.
