Hercules is provoked till he has no other choice then fight Gargan, a giant who had absolutely no quarrel with him- and decks the mountain of aggression easily. Then the last survivor of a group of messengers, killed off one by one by Hera, dies after imploring him to come end her rule of terror in the 'lost city of Troy', which his father Zeus, who is once more unwilling to extend any more tangible help, discloses can only be found with the 'one true compass' last seen in the possession of queen Omphale. On his searching for her he frees -then against her will- Deianeira, the eager victim about to be sacrificed to the river god as virgin in the prime of her fertility to end a drought. He battles passed the 48 sons of the gate guardian and arranges to be sold at the annual slave market to the queen, who only wants him in her bed. After dealing with some protection racketeers and the devoted, happy palace slave Waylin he finally gets her late husbands compass from Omphale. He sets out on the journey with Deianeira; a sea monster swallows them, but is defeated. On land they find her father, the dying king of Troy who names her his heir, prepare an army of Trojans to reconquer the city and enter it unopposed, but then emerges an army of Heras minions, whose leader is about to sacrifice Deianeira and puts up a good fight against Hercules.
