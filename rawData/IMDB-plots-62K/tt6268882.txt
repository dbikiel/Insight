As Maddie reveals stories of being bullied and of wanting to run away and be a Juggalo, the two form a unique bond. In FAMILY, Schilling delivers a delightful and layered comedic performance. Laura Steinel's debut feature has heart, reminding us that family can be found in all different forms.
An emotionally-stunted aunt tries to bond with her 13-year-old niece, who wants nothing more than to run away from home and become a juggalo.
