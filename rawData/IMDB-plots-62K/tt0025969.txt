Ted Hayden impersonates a wanted man and joins Gentry's gang only to learn later that Gentry was the one who killed his father. He saves Virginia Winters' dad's ranch from Gentry and also rescues his long-lost brother Spud.
Ted Hayden and his pal Dusty Rhodes come across a dying outlaw, Gatt Ganns. On Ganns's person, they find a letter of introduction to rancher Gentry implicating Gentry in the disappearance of Ted's kid brother Jim and the murder of their father many years earlier. Ted takes on Ganns's identity and pretends to go to work for Gentry, while actually looking for further evidence that Gentry did indeed murder his father and abduct his brother.
