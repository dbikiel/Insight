A bored wife leaves her husband for an unemployed, petty criminal.
Maurice Pialat's portrait of contemporary France mocks prosperity as a substitute for social and sexual revolution. Nelly abandons her bourgeois friends and a steady relationship for the unemployed layabout Loulou, whose charms include focusing his energy into sex.
After a wild night out at a crammed with people Parisian discotheque and a chance encounter with the indolent ex-convict, Loulou, the young accountant, Nelly, makes a sudden but conscious decision. Fed up with her dull and unadventurous husband, André, Nelly summons up the courage to abandon her comfortable bourgeois life and her friends, intent on trading her apathetic existence for an exciting life with her beguiling and profligate new companion, Loulou. However, is André willing to take this uncomfortable situation lying down? Can there be a future in this impossible love triangle?
