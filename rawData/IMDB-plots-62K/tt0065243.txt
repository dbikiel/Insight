A race of sexy women from Angvia, a planet in another dimension, come to earth to kidnap women to repopulate their planet.
A British superspy comedy with a Pop Art aesthetic, ZETA ONE is the kind of psychedelic, sexy thriller that inspired the Austin Powers series. In this playful spoof at the James Bond films, Robin Hawdon stars as Word...James Word, a womanizing secret agent whose investigation of a criminal mastermind (James Robertson Justice) leads him to discover a race of beautiful, exotic superwomen. Further inquiry exposes the naked truth, that these women have been abducted and brainwashed by the alien, interdimensional goddess Zeta (Dawn Addams).
