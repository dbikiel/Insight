Karzzzz is an upcoming 2008 Bollywood film, directed by Satish Kaushik. The film stars Himesh Reshammiya and Urmila Matondkar. The film is a remake of "Karz" which starred: Rishi Kapoor, Simi Garewal and Tina Munim. This film might be different than the old one. The film is planned to be released in October 2008. The plot could possibly be quite similar to Farah Khan's "Om Shanti Om", which was also based on Karz.
Urmila Matondkar is all set to reprise the role of Kamini played by Simi Garewal in the original Karz. It is learnt that Urmilas Kamini will be more glamourous than the one we saw in the original. Urmila is all set to do a special dance number in the film called Tandoori Nights. Its not an item song but something more spectacular than that.
