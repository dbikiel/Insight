A serial killer has been killing beautiful women in New York and the new owner of a media company offers a high ranking job to the first of his senior executives who can get the earliest scoops on the case.
Death of media magnate Amos Kyne is causing power struggle between his executives. In the meantime New York women become prey of a serial killer. Reporter Edward Mobley is in that circumstances faced with almost impossible missions: to catch the killer, to prevent the media empire from falling into the wrong hands and to save his romantic relationship from break-up.
Bedridden Amos Kyne's the owner and manager of Kyne Enterprises. Upon Amos' death, his son, the ineffective Walter, takes control of the business. Not wanting to do any of the work but retain the glory, Walter creates a new position; 'executive director' - that person who effectively will become head of the organisation, and a power struggle erupts between the executives. Meanwhile, a serial killer's in the rampage in New York, and women throughout the boroughs fear for their lives, as reporter Ed Mobley's trying to catch the killer, as well as prevent the Kyne from being destroyed as a result of the boardroom brawl.
After the elderly Amos Kyne dies, his arrogant son Walter takes over the family news empire. He decides he wants to appoint an executive director to help him out. Not knowing which of his three senior executives - representing their wire service, daily newspapers and TV news - to select, he tells them that one who gets the scoop on a string of sex murders will get the job. TV newsman Ed Mobley hopes the the newspaper editor, Jon Day Griffith, will get the job and so sets out to help him find the killer. With information from his police contact, he challenges the killer on air putting himself and his fianc√©e in danger.
