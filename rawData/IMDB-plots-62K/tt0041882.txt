On a plane trip, Charlie Chan and the passengers are drugged, and when they wake up a quarter million dollars is missing.
All the passengers on an airplane headed for San Francisco are drugged, and when they wake up, it is discovered that a quarter-million dollars is missing. Charlie Chan--and, of course, his #1 son--must discover the identity of the person who doped the passengers and stole the money.
All of the passengers on a San Francisco-bound airliner wake up and discover they have slept through a murder and a $250,000 robbery. With one exception. Almost every passenger, the two pilots and the stewardess become primes suspects in the eyes of detective Charlie Chan. While Charlie moves through his investigation, dropping Oriental witticisms here and there, three more corpses add to the mystery, while cutting down the numbers of suspects to sift through.
