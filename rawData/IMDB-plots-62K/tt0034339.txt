A feisty retiree plays peacemaker for a young couple.
Seton Mansley aka Alfred Crane narrates--and steals the show--as a Florida retiree who intercedes to patch up problems between Kathleen Brown and Johnny Kerrigan.
In Palm Beach, Florida, elderly Seton Mansley, who lives in the Seminole Trailer Park, acts as a white knight of sorts to salesgirl Kathleen Brown in helping her get her job back after she is fired. Out of that circumstance, Seton becomes "Uncle Seton" to Kathleen both as her advisor in dealing with the cause of her firing, namely the advances of a customer, wealthy playboy Johnny Kerrigan, and because in that role Johnny just assumes Seton is her uncle. Johnny being a playboy is largely a rebellion against being the reluctant president of the family business, it handed to him when his father died. Kathleen is just the latest woman Johnny has tried to woo and marry. Kathleen and Seton get some unexpected additional help in navigating the waters with Johnny from one of Johnny's past conquests, Carol West, who was in love with Johnny but knew that she didn't love him enough to deal with the complications of his world, where he doesn't seem to have found that balance between his social life and his business commitments. But in advising Kathleen, Seton may have some inside knowledge into Johnny's life, knowledge which he has not divulged to any of his new friends.
