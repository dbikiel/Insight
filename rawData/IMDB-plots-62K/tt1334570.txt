Many objected to leather-jacket, spike-hair kids with tattoos. But, that did not dissuade a generation... No one realized that a little club in Costa Mesa, CA would end up spawning a multi-billion dollar youth culture that still endures today! It was the Cuckoos Nest of the late 70s and early 80s. With archival, unseen and new footage, the filmmakers compiled an intimate story about the beginning of a movement, a place of refuge for a youth culture, a fearful establishment and a police force that didnt understand what was happening. Watch interviews with Nest owner, Jerry Roach and legendary entertainers like: Rick Agnew, Tony Alva, Duane Peters, Steve Soto, Jello Biafra, Tony Cadena, Jack Grisham, Chuck Dukowski and Joe Escalante. Enjoy show clips of Iggy Pop, The Ramones, The Dead Kennedys, David Johansen and the New York Dolls. Meet the real Pat Brown immortalized by the Vandals. Watch groups like TSOL, The Adolescents, Black Flag and the Circle Jerks.
