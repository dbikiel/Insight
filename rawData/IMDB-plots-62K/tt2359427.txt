The life story of basketball sensation, Jeremy Lin.
In February 2012, an entire nation of basketball fans unexpectedly went 'Linsane.' Stuck in the mire of a disappointing season, the New York Knicks did what no other NBA team had thought about doing. They gave backup point guard Jeremy Lin an opportunity to prove himself. He took full advantage, scoring more points in his first five NBA starts than any other player in the modern era, and created a legitimate public frenzy in the process. Prior to this now-legendary run, Lin had faced adversity in his career at every turn. He wasn't offered a scholarship by any major university, nor was he drafted by any NBA team after a standout collegiate career at Harvard.
In February 2012, the New York Knicks were having a truly unremarkable season and seemed unlikely to see postseason play when a star emerged from their ranks -- Jeremy Lin, a point guard who sparked a seven-game winning streak that galvanized fans and gave the Knicks an unexpected shot at a playoff spot. While the Knicks' sudden turnaround seemed like something out of a movie, Lin was the unlikely hero -- a player of Taiwanese and Chinese heritage who was one of the few Asian-Americans playing in the NBA, and an athlete whose promising career had known more than a few setbacks, causing him to wonder if he might be cut from the Knicks' team before things finally clicked. Filmmaker Evan Jackson Leong had been following Lin's career before he became a fan favorite in early 2012, and in the documentary Linsanity, he presents the full story of Lin's life on and off the court, including his relationship with his family, his college career at Harvard, his stint with the Houston Rockets, how he deals with racism in a sport where few Asians excel, and his strong Christian faith..
