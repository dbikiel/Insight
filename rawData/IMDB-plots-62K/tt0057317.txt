Italy, 1630. The widower Pasquale loses his job as a cobbler. In search of food for his twelve children, he and a poor companion disguise as mendicant monks and knock for help at the castle of the beautiful widowed marquise Fiorenza. But she begs him to prevent an unwelcome wedding to the sinister Don Egidio.
