While Bruno is an international money mover and influence peddler and Virginia is his very beautiful wife, his sexual appetite requires the services of banker and part-time hooker Alex. It's love at first sight. But, who are the lovers?
A bank accountant, who moonlights as a high-priced call girl, becomes embroiled in the lives of a money launderer, his seductive wife, and his bodyguard who blackmails her to help the FBI entrap him with his latest money laundering scheme.
Alex Lee is a Long Beach bank executive who moonlights as a $1,500-a-night call girl for financial purposes, which takes a turn when one of her clients, Bruno Buckingham, an international money launder/handler, takes an instant liking to Alex. But Bruno's personal chauffeur/bodyguard Tony turns out to be an undercover FBI agent who tells Alex to co-operate with him in helping to nail Bruno and if she refuses, they will nail her for prostitution. While trying to figure a way out of the predicament she's in, Alex takes a liking to Bruno's attractive Chinese wife Virgina Chow who doesn't realize that Bruno is setting her up as a patsy to take the blame for his crimes, while Alex is unaware that Tony plans to nail her anyway after he nails Bruno.
