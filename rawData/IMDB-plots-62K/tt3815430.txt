Deep in the English moors, a sociopath preys on innocent people, until one day his secrets are finally revealed and an inevitable confrontation is at hand.
Morris is a recluse with psychotic tendencies, whose life changes when his innocent daughter Lauren rescues one of his victims and befriends him. Jake, an ordinary businessman, soon realises that he is stranded and his presence in the house gradually reveals unexpected and dark mysteries from the past.
Deep in the remote English moors, after a horrible car accident, the unconscious lawyer Jake wakes up in the isolated farmhouse of Morris, an overprotecting single father, and his sheltered daughter Lauren. However, almost immediately, a rather peculiar feeling and the premonition that something is really unhealthy between Lauren and her father makes Jake rushing to leave, but when all attempts end up in failure, Jake will soon be led to the conclusion that he is anything but a welcome guest in this house, but rather, a helpless hostage. Gradually, as Jake and Lauren secretly befriend, a rapid descend into paranoia will begin as secrets are violently revealed and no one will be prepared for the consequences.
