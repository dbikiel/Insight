An adaptation of Raymond Khoury's novel about a New York archaeologist researching the lost secrets of the medieval Knights Templar.
During a gala museum event featuring precious Vatican artifacts, a group of men posing as Templar knights stage a daring robbery. Their primary interest is in obtaining a mechanical decoding device that can supposedly decipher the location of the Templar treasure. Archaeologist Tess Chaykin reluctantly works with FBI Agent Sean Daley to uncover the mastermind behind the plot and possibly locate the treasure.
Now in Turkey, Tess Chaykin and Sean Daley travel to the site where they believe the Templar treasure is to be found. They are not the only ones there however as those who wish to reveal the Templars secret and those who wish them to remain secret are also after the treasure. When the treasure is revealed, it contains information that could rock the very foundation of Christianity.
In New York, during the opening of the exposition of the Treasures of the Vatican for the public, four criminals posing as Templar knights break in the museum riding horses and heist the valuable artifacts. The archaeologist Dr. Tess Chaykin steals the horse of a policeman and chases and captures one thief with Red Cross of Constantine. The FBI Agent Sean Daley teams up with Tess that learns that the criminals' prime intention is a decoder mechanical device that can provide the location of the Templar treasure. They travel to Turkey where Tess expects to find the treasure and discover a conspiracy of the Church to keep classified information in secret to protect the Catholic Church.
