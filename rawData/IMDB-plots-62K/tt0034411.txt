Vacuum-cleaner salesmen Homer "Jeeper" Smith and "Breezy" Jones are accidentally inducted into the army, and "Jeeper", who can sell anything, immediately begins to try and convince, Colonel Dobson, their cavalry officer of the Old School---from the "nothing can replace a horse in a battle" school---that the age of mechanization has arrived and "Jeeper" has a deal for him on some tanks. This also helps further the romance between the colonels' daughter, Bliss (named after the fort in El Paso), and Captain Joe Radcliffe, a mechanical engineer with the tank corps. Along the way, at an U. S. O show (featuring the Navy Blues Sextette from the film "Navy Blues"), "Jeeper" does an Apache Dance, spikes the lemonade with alum, and sings "I'm Glad My Number Was Called."
