A willful woman concocts an elaborate scheme to trap a handsome pediatrician into marriage.
Living in the big city, Anabel Sims, a shop girl at Roger Sanford and Co. Department Store, has matrimony at the front of her mind, but no potential husband discounting "Old Joe" back in her hometown of Greenville, he who she has no intention of marrying even if he asks her. She knows who she will want to marry once she sees the man, and believes that women should be able to take on the traditional male role in the courtship ritual in pursuing that man. It is love at first sight for her when she spots who she will learn is esteemed pediatrician Dr. Madison W. Brown, she indeed using every trick at her disposal to get him to want to marry her. She learns that he is a creature of habit, which makes it easy for her to stalk him, but she also learns that he considers himself a confirmed bachelor, and if he does decide to marry that he wants to choose his own wife rather than the other way around as he quickly learns what she is doing in constantly and "accidentally" running into him. As such, Anabel adds another measure of attack in her plan, namely to have a potential suitor in name only to make Madison believe that he has competition in garnering her affections. The name she comes up with is Roger Sanford, the owner of the department store. Complications ensue when Roger does actually get involved in Anabel's personal life, he a thrice married and currently single playboy who generally does fall for women if he knows someone else is after them, such as an esteemed pediatrician.
