Based on the popular conman character of KIM Seon-dal from Korean folktale who famously sold the water of Daedong River.
In-hong is drafted into the army by force to fight in China during the Qing Dynasty. During the struggle to survive in the battlefield, he meets Bo-won and Gyeon. Three men return to Korea to find no means to make living, and decide to form a con ring. Their cons range from selling a chicken as phoenix and disguising an ordinary sword as one that belonged to the great Admiral Yi Shun-shin. Soon, they become wanted by the authorities. The trio continues their scam under the radar. When their attempt to steal from the richest man in town, SUNG Dae-ryun, fails, In-hong sets up another con. He spreads the rumor that gold has been found in Daedong River, and lures SUNG into the trap.
