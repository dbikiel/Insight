The crooked manager of a taxicab company is out to drive the independent owners/drivers out of business through various tactics such as sabotage, beatings and intimidation. But he crosses paths with "Slip" Mahoney, who is driving an independent cab as a favor, and the rest of the 'Bowery Boys," and this does not bode well for the crook and his henchmen.
As repayment to a priest who got him out of a scrape with the law, Slip agrees to drive the cab of a cabbie who has been injured in a collision. The job turns out to be more trouble than it's worth, as Slip's girlfriend is mad at him for working so much he hardly sees her, and Slip finds out that a rival cab company is involved in a scheme to wreck all of their competitors' cabs so they can have the whole city to themselves.
