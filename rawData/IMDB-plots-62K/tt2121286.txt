Three Jamaicans, who are deported from the U.S., Canada, and England, must make their way in a land that they are not familiar with.
A searing drama in the vein of City of God, Home Again tells the story of three young people deported home to Jamaica after being raised abroad since infancy. Once landed in Kingston and without a compass of any kind, each of the characters embarks on a journey that pushes their endurance beyond measure and forces them to discover who they truly are. On the most fundamental level, Home Again asks the question, How would you survive?
