THE BLANK GENERATION - Official D-I-Y 16mm black/white film shot by insider Ivan Kral (1970s guitarist Patti Smith Group, Blondie, Iggy Pop) originally for his personal home movies. This is the official 1976 film, and not to be confused with other films of the same title. Kral's raw footage captures the birth of influential punk music legends in their humble beginnings. Historic footage includes early Talking Heads, Ramones, Patti Smith Group, Blondie, Television, New York Dolls, Heartbreakers and more. Venues include CBGB, Maxs Kansas City, the Bottom Line, Debbie Harry's apartment and more. Known as the only visual testament on the birth of New York punk, this grainy clip compilation was shot between 1974 - 1975. Kral's "movie camera" didn't record audio, so music is added from the band's own cassettes and/or demo recordings. Edited with underground filmmaker Amos Poe. This is amateur quality, but it stands as the only document that genuinely conveys the birth of punk. www.TheBLANKGeneration.com www.IvanKral.net
