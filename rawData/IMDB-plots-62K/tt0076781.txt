Cool van-driving stud Steve gets the hots for Anita, who's the new girl in town. However, this doesn't go over well with Steve's bitchy and jealous girlfriend Donna, who sets Steve up by telling the cops that he's a cocaine dealer. Donna covers her tracks by claiming that Anita ratted Steve out to the cops. This in turn incurs the wrath of Steve's fellow van-driving buddies.
