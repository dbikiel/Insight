Charlie Colquhoun is a journalist whose career is floundering. As a teenager, he fathered a daughter, Tommy, who was committed to foster care as an infant. Seventeen years later, Charlie, Tommy and Charlie's old schoolmate Harris Hill, now a squeaky-clean solicitor, are reunited by a scandal that includes child pornography, blackmail and murder.
