An unwed mother, forced to give up her child to avoid scandal, follows her son's life from afar even as she prospers in business.
During World War I, small-town girl Josephine Norris has an illegitimate son by an itinerant pilot. After a scheme to adopt him ends up giving him to another family, she devotes her life to loving him from afar.
It's World War II in London. Middle aged American cosmetics maven Jody Norris, who has lived in London for twenty years, is doing her part for the war effort. Her hard and straight-forward exterior masks her loneliness, she who had never married. She solely clings to the memory of her one true romantic love, Captain Bart Cosgrove, who she has not seen since he went away during World War I and was presumed killed. She had a few wannabe beaus in her younger years while she was growing up in Pierson Falls in upstate New York, those beaus being Alec Pierson and Mac Tilton, who both wanted to marry her. But in her mind, neither was Bart Cosgrove. Instead, Jody focused on earning a living all in the name of achieving a singular goal. Despite receiving the romantic attention of a Lord Desham, Jody drops everything to meet American Lieutenant Gregory 'Grigsy' Pierson, the adopted son of Alec Pierson and his eventual wife, Corinne. Grigsy has a week long leave in London. Lord Desham comes to understand Jody's connection to Grigsy and does whatever he can to assist in her happiness.
