The demons of hell play music for Satan, whose delight turns to wrath when an insubordinate refuses to become food for Cerberus.
Satan and the demons gather for a wild party. After the demons play music, Satan has them "milk" burning flames out of a dragon cow and he drinks them. He then feeds one of his little demons to his three-headed hound Cerberus. The other one runs away and eventually kicks Satan off a cliff where he is consumed by flames.
The demons of hell are a crazy, wicked bunch. A spider swings on his strand toward the viewer, doing his best to be menacing; but the anthropomorphic flames grab him and carry him down to an even deeper pit in Hell. Cerberus barks and scratches to the tune of "Jingle Bells." A dragon-like snake eats a bat who promptly pokes its wings through the beast and flies off. Meanwhile, little demons play "Funeral March of a Marionette" for Satan, who thoroughly enjoys it. It's time for Satan's meal, and two minions provide it by milking a demonic cow. Satan enjoys his flaming beverage, but his delight turns to wrath when one of the servers refuses to become food for Cerberus.
