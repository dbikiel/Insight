An old movie house plagued with a history of unexplained tragedies is reopened with bloody history repeating itself
A haunted movie theater is the setting of many bizarre murders, (i.e. "popcorned" to death in the popcorn machine), in this sleazy horror spoof.
Spot Light Cinema have just taken over a closed down theater, with a tragic enigmatic past, concerning a fired theater's manager in the earlier part of the 20th century who snapped and ended up a mass murderer, offing a female member of staff before turning his rage on the cinema-goers. Despite this notoriety, Spot Light are dead set on opening up as yet another one of their own movie houses. But the past won't stay buried and soon both staff and visitors alike are dying off one by one
