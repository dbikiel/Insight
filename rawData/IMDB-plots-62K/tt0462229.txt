An amnesiac wakes up in a hotel room next to a dead FBI agent and $250,000. Is the sexy lady in the lobby his wife? Is he a spy or a cleaner?
Jake is a seemingly regular guy who has no idea who he is after being hit over the head by mysterious assailants; when he finds himself entangled in a government conspiracy, Jake and his pursuers become convinced that he is an undercover agent.
Jake wakes up in a hotel room beside a dead FBI agent and a suitcase full of money. He does not remember anything, indicating that he is suffering from amnesia. As he runs from the hotel he is met by Diane, who tells Jake that she is his wife. Diane takes Jake to a big mansion and calls the doctor to check him. Diane and the doctor discuss how to bring back Jake's memory and the doctor suggests a sexual scenario. Jake overhears Diane and the doctor's conversation and runs away from the mansion in a Benz with the money. Jake goes back to the hotel in disguise and gets an envelope at the reception office which has a D.A.R.T card in it. During this course of the plot he keeps getting flash episodes of him dressed as a special ops guy and fighting bad guys. He is convinced that he is a spy and forgot about it. He now sits at a diner in front of D.A.R.T and meets Gina here. She tells him that Jake works as a janitor at D.A.R.T, which he does not believe.
