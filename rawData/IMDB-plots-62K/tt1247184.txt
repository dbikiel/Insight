A man prepares and goes to work in a bizarre world, where the meaning of human workforce is taken to another level.
In a bizarre world, a working man is awoken by his alarm clock. He shaves, dresses and has breakfast. An unknown man holds up his mirror. Three people make up his chair and table. A woman stands, at the door, working as his coat hanger. He hails a ride and rides piggyback all the way to work. At a traffic light, a group of humans riding humans await the light to change. There are two men hanging on a pole representing traffic lights. One opens his jacket and reveals a red shirt. Then he closes his jacket, so the other man can reveal his green shirt. He puts his coat and briefcase in a locker where a woman is hanging on the locker door working as his coat hanger and briefcase holder. He takes an elevator ride up, using a human counterweight. There, he begins his work as a doormat. His boss shows up, scrapes his feet on his back and enters his office. He continues to lay there in front of an office door.
We live, we breathe, we feel, we work, we think, we dream, we love and we die. All this, in a nutshell, makes us humans, however, in a world where everyone has or needs a job, can we be what we really want to be rather than what others want us to be? Furthermore, where does personal freedom end, and where does exploitation begin? In the end, are, we, modern humans and citizens of a brave new world, nothing but invisible interchangeable cogs in an impenetrable so-called democratic system that grinds down the precious individuality and spews out compliant servants?
