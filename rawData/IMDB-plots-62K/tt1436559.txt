A happy newlywed marriage counselor's views on wedded bliss get thrown for a loop when she finds out her parents are getting divorced.
Handsome, romantic, sexy gentile Charlie enjoys his honeymoon with liberal-Jewish marriage counselor Ava. It's cut short when her parents Bradley and Betty, who always seemed the perfect couple, suddenly border on divorce over an old affair and poorly matched expectations. Worse, in turn they invite themselves to move in and drive the newly-weds crazy. Ethics prevent Ava from taking them on as clients and the colleagues she refers to prove hopelessly inept. Meanwhile Charlie's impulsive buddy Gerber, the eternal bachelor party animal, has married Polish green-card-chaser Kasia.
