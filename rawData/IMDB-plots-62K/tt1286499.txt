At the Edge of the World chronicles the controversial Sea Shepherd Antarctic Campaign against a Japanese whaling fleet. The international volunteer crew, under-trained and under-equipped, develop a combination of bizarre and brilliant tactics with which to stop the whalers. But first they must find the Japanese ships, a far more difficult challenge than ever imagined - long-time activist Paul Watson and first-time captain Alex Cornelissen employ an array of strategies in the hopes of finding an elusive adversary in the vast expanse of the Ross Sea. With one ship (the Farley Mowat) too slow to chase down the whaling fleet, with their second ship (the Robert Hunter) unsuited for Antarctic ice conditions and with no country supporting their efforts to enforce international law, the situation becomes increasingly desperate. Against all odds, however, a real-life pirate tale unfolds - a modern-day "David vs. Goliath" adventure.
In an age when comic-book superheroes rule the screen, there is something very special about ordinary people willing to take extraordinary chances with no assurance that they'll be around to see the credits. Whether or not viewers agree with their cause, the willingness of these volunteers to risk their lives for something greater than themselves is a reasonably good definition of true heroism. The cause in this particular story concerns the efforts to stop a Japanese fleet in the Antarctic Whale Sanctuary in early 2007. The Sea Shepherd campaign was arguably "the perfect combination of imperfections" and the risks taken were astonishingly reckless and admirable. The adventure which unfolded in the uniquely beautiful &amp; treacherous Ross Sea that winter also brought to life the larger questions of ends &amp; means, injustice &amp; indifference, idealism &amp; greed, laws &amp; politics and life &amp; death.
