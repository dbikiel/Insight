Marley and Brad Hoffman are a couple of vile white trash degenerates who treat their mute mentally stunted cousin Jessicka like a pet: They make her wear a collar, force her to eat dog food, take her out for walks on a leash, and even occasionally lock her up in a dog cage. However, things go horribly awry when Jessicka contracts rabies after being bitten by a dog.
