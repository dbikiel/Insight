The raunchy, spunky tale of the rise and fall of an all-girl rock band from Portland, Oregon.
A comedic tale which charts the fast rise and fall of an all-girl, four-piece Portland rock band, The Paper Dolls. Working day jobs while dreaming of success, aspiring young rockers Kali, Lavender and Reggie get the jump start they need when local legend Fauna, singer for the obscure band The Snogs, joins them as lead singer. But Fauna, street-wise and opportunistic, just wants to use them on her way to stardom. The commercial direction in which Fauna is leading the band begins chipping away at their friendship. All comes to a head during a two-day party at the Doll House--a house into which they all have recently moved. The next morning, a body is found, someone is dead, and the Dolls' world changes forever.
