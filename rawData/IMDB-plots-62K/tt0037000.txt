Liza Elliott, "Allure" magazines editor-in-chief, suffers from headaches and continuous daydreams and undergoes psychoanalysis to determine why.
The hard-working and successful editor of a fashion magazine (decades before The Devil Wears Prada) is portrayed as deeply neurotic. Her physician can find to physical cause for her headaches and refers her to a Freudian analyst. Dreams eventually reveal that she is desperate need of a man to take charge. The story is widely reputed to be the only film ever to show a Freudian analyst seriously, and that may be so, but as a result the movie is far more humorous, in retrospect, than it was ever intended to be. Worth watching for the costumes and music.
