This Broadway revue is about two love affairs. The romance between the comedienne Joan Mason and Jack Evans of Boston is easily disturbed by Jack's cynical sister, Clara Belle Evans, who is against their relationship. The romance between the wealthy British Jill Martin and Tom McGrath, the assistant to the impresario George White Brodway is a love hate relationship. Gene Krupa and his band keep, together with the virtuoso organist Ethel Smith, both couples dancing a lot.
