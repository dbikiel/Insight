Based on a true story, a love affair develops between a half brother and half-sister. When pregnancy results and word gets out the public is outraged.
Juli's husband commits suicide, so she is being persuaded to shed her own. One day she gets acquainted with Gy√∂rgy, who, after several years of absence, returns to his native village. They love each other, but later it turns out that he is the son of her mother's first marriage. When she understands that he is her half-brother, she wants to break with him. However, the feeling that connects them is far more powerful than just telling each other.
