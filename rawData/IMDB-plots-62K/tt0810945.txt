A mockumentary following an ambitious TV network executive trying to produce a controversial reality show where contestants play Russian Roulette.
In a world where reality and entertainment are continuously colliding, Academy Award winning documentary filmmaker Bill Guttentag's feature debut Live! follows ABN network president Katy Courbet and up-and-coming documentary filmmaker Rex as inspiration strikes to create the most daring reality program ever. The show is Russian Roulette, network style, with contestants competing for five million dollars on-air, complete with loaded guns. As seen through the lens of a documentary film crew, Live! examines the competitive and often gut-wrenching world of television production, where everyone from the crew to the contestants to the network brass becomes engulfed in a ratings battle to the top-a battle where questions of morality, ethics and sheer will lead to a darkly humorous and unforgettable outcome.
The greedy ABN television network executive Katy Coubert is seeking a way to increase the audience of her network. She recalls the arenas, police car chases and several other examples through history to demonstrate that people enjoy watching blood and she has the idea of producing a controversial reality show of Russian Roulette with six contestants and five-million dollars for each winner. Katy has to convince the network Powers That Be that the show will be well successful and will increase the TV ratings while the network lawyer Don convinces the authorities to allow the late night show. Then she selects the six contestants: the aspirant actress Jewel; the Mexican gay cook Pablo; the aspirant writer Byron; the performer Abalone; the just graduated student and surfer Brad; and Rick. Will the show be well-succeeded?
