A lonely widower finds himself facing both his own regrets and his devout Calvinist community when he takes a deranged vagrant into his home.
Devout Calvinist widower Fred leads a respectable, utterly boring life since he evicted his only son. Suddenly arrives Theo, a mentally impaired adult, mental age about five. Fred starts enjoying 'fathering' again, becomes protective and even defends him against bully urchins and the pretentious bigot sexton. When Theo asks to 'wed' Fred, both grumpy men's darkest secrets and regrets have to be dealt with.
