Scottish islanders try to plunder 50,000 cases of whisky from a stranded ship.
Based on a true story. The name of the real ship, that sunk Feb 5 1941 - during WWII - was S/S Politician. Having left Liverpool two days earlier, heading for Jamaica, it sank outside Eriskay, The Outer Hebrides, Scotland, in bad weather, containing 250,000 bottles of whisky. The locals gathered as many bottles as they could, before the proper authorities arrived, and even today, bottles are found in the sand or in the sea every other year.
When 50,000 cases of whisky are stranded on a ship which runs aground, the inhabitants of a Scottish island cannot resist the temptation. Unfortunately, a Home Guard captain (an Englishman) stands in their way.
A bottle of whisky recovered from the wreck of a cargo ship which inspired the film Whisky Galore! has sold at auction for Â£2200.
