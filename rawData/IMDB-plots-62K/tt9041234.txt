Franck wants a quiet life and a fresh start. After 15 years of a failed theatre career, he finds a seemingly perfect job: museum guard. But that is before he meets Sybille, his neurotic colleague.
After realizing that he is a complete failure as a director, Franck (Pio Marmai) abandons his theatrical career to become a completely sedentary museum keeper. It is just a temporary job for two months but could be extended if there is an opening in the staff. The colleagues are all rather quirky but nice, except for one very hostile woman, Sybille (LÃ©a Drucker) who tries to irritate him in every way possible. But it is time for the annual museum reserve inventory, and Franck and Sybille are teamed up to do it. Franck notices that a few items are missing, and tries to investigate, but Sybille sabotages his work, destroying his notes and pouring hot tea on the laptop they are using. It turns out that she has been selling small art objects to a shady pharmacist in town. Franck catches on, and she confesses. She tries to get the objects back, but the pharmacist refuses. Franck goes instead and cleverly pressures the pharmacist into giving all of the items back. Sybille is impressed with Franck's skills. She proposes that the two of them sell a valuable item from the reserves. She will get the money and she will also resign from the museum so that Franck can have a permanent job there. Franck doesn't like the idea, but there is starting to be chemistry between them, so he finally goes along with the plan. The object is sold, Sibylle resigns and leaves the country, going to a place in Portugal where she had always promised to celebrate her birthday. Franck realizes that he is in love, hijacks another colleague's car and drives to Portugal to find her. They finally meet up and we are left to speculate where their story will go from there.
