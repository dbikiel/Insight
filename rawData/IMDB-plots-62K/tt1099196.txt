Delhi-based fellow-collegians-cum-hostelers, Sanjay Mishra, and Apurv, challenge each other to win the University elections and sleep with three different girls respectively before the election results. While Sanjay sets out to canvas his candidacy, often with violence, against his opponents, Rajesh Solanki and Bunty Nagaar; nonchalant Apurv picks on Vaishali, a prostitute; cute and adorable high school student, Kintu; and is on the look out for a third girl. The question is will Apurv be able to find a third girl in time; and will Sanjay make a mark as the President of the Delhi University Students' Union?
Dil Dosti Etc is set around students in Delhi University. Through two university hostellers, Apurv, a rich cosmopolitan guy and, Sanjay, an old-fashioned Bihari guy, the film juxtaposes the 'new/ liberal' and the 'old/ conservative' in our society. Sanjay is an ambitious and focused Bihari student-politician in Delhi. He represents the romantic and the idealist who steadfastly pursues his political goals. On the other hand, Apurv's life is directionless. With the abundance of time and money in hand, he searches for meaning in life through amorous escapades with various girls. The three female leads that of a prostitute, a schoolgirl and a rich model, provide a myriad of social and emotional backdrops to the film. Vaisali plays an attractive but sharp-tongued prostitute. She claims never to get emotionally attached to her customers. Then there is the vibrant and flirtatious schoolgirl Kintu, who coquettishly remains noncommittal and always plays hard to get. Prerna is the rich South Delhi babe who aspires to become an international model, and yet finds herself attracted to the earthy and charismatic student-politician, Sanjay.
