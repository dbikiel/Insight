The lives of four art students change forever when gifted young artist Hagumi arrives at their school and befriends their group as each student experiences turbulence in love.
Shy architect Takemoto, pensive ceramics student Ayumi, hardworking senior Mayama, and super-senior artistic madman Morita are four students at an art college in Japan, each taught by Professor Hanamoto. When artistic prodigy Hagumi, the daughter of Hanamoto's cousin, arrives at the school, Takemoto falls for her immediately. However, Professor Hanamoto suspects that Hagumi may open her heart to Morita faster, leaving the dejected Takemoto to decide whether he should yield to Morita, or continue to fight for his affections. Meanwhile, Ayumi pursues Mayama, who looks right through her due to being obsessively in love with his boss...a much older, widowed woman.
