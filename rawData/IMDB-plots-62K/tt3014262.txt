The deranged millionaire John Hodgman plays his last Ragnarok stand-up comedy show on the last day of human history: December 21, 2012.
On December 21, 2011, John Hodgman predicted that a series of major catastrophes would strike the planet in one year, ending life on earth as we know it. On December 21, 2012, he gathered his followers to a former warehouse on the shore of the Gowanus Canal to greet their fate together. This is the only document of that evening.
