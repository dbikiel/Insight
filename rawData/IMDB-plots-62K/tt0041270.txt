This acclaimed crime-drama by Director Alejandro Galindo, (and co-directed by actor Jose Pulido, also one of this film's stars), is considered the prototypical example of "Cine Negra Mexicano, otherwise known as Mexican Film Noir, with a unique shadowy, black and white focus on its usual subjects-namely gangsters, cops, and good-girls-gone-bad. It tells the story of four gangsters who successfully ambush and rob a money transport vehicle, but not without killing its occupants in the process. After eluding the police, the quartet must hide out in the attic of a home belonging to one of their co-conspirator's mistresses. Their escape plans, nerves and fellowship all start to fracture, as the four must lie low in hot, cramped and dank conditions. Restored versions of Cuatro Contra el Mundo were featured at both the 65th Berlin International Film Festival in 2015, and the 12th annual FICM Mexican Cine Negra series, in collaboration with the Film Library of UNAM, Televisa Foundation, and the Nationale Cinematheque.
