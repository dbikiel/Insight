After an over-cocky inter-forces 'anti-terrorism' game in which he damaged the minister's car, Belgian Army special ops diver Rick Symons is transferred to the Navy. Alas, in Koksijde base's rescue unit, rivalry among both Seaking helicopter crews is as dangerously blind. Rick has a stormy hate-love-relationship with female medic Alex Breynaert. And his past, an incident which left veteran Koen crippled for life, sort of catches up. Koen's crazy scheme has dire consequences, breaking Rick's will to go on. But he changes his mind during a ship fire emergency and takes extreme risks.
