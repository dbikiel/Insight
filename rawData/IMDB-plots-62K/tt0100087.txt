The luxurious villa of Mark and Jessie Bannister, a yuppie couple, is overrun by loads of uninvited guests who turn the house up side down.
Mark and Jessie Bannister have a problem. Actually, SEVERAL problems. Namely his cousins, her sister and nephew, and the neighbours next door. All this, problems at work and a cat that keeps coming back from the dead.
Stockbroker Mark and his new broadcaster wife Jessie Bannister have just moved into their own big house and are nearly broke. Everything seems to be perfect until Mark gets his mail and discovers that his cousin Fred and wife Bernice are coming to stay for a holiday. Fred used to be a wild-guy but now he is a jobless man with no self-esteem thanks to his dominating wife. Bernice is pregnant, and when she has an accident when leaving to go home she ends up stuck in bed for the rest of the pregnancy. Also Jessie's gold-digger sister Claudia and son Jonathan and the next door neighbours are forced to (or force Mark and Jesse to) stay in the house. This causes unwanted pressure on Mark as he tries to land an account with a multi-millionaire and the stress causes Jesse to nearly lose her TV job, just as she is ready to hit the big time. Can Mark and Jesse EVER get their house back - without murder?.....
