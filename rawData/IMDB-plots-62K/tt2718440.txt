After failing to locate the legendary Stanley Kubrick, an unstable CIA agent must instead team up with a seedy rock band manager to develop the biggest con of all time-staging the moon landing.
What if Apollo 11 never actually made it? What if, in reality, Stanley Kubrick secretly shot the famous images of the moon landing in a studio, working for the US administration? This is the premise of a totally plausible conspiracy theory that takes us to swinging sixties London, where a stubborn CIA agent will never find Kubrick but instead is forced to team up with a lousy manager of a seedy rock band to develop the biggest con of all time, in this riotous, high-tempo action-comedy.
Petty rock group 'agent' Jonathan 'Jonny' is a his wit's end, desperate to sign a contract fro his measly only clients to pay off violent loan-shark Iron Monger. While begging in vain for a job or loan from his wealthy cousin Derek Kaye, whose clients include real celebrities, he's mistaken for him and a-eagerly but blindly accepts a rush job to hire director Stanley Kubrick for a 'Hollywood project'. So his junkie roommate, actor Leon, impersonates the star and as blindly signs up after playing too hard to get, for the bizarre project. It's the assignment of CIA agent Kidman, a psychotically traumatized Vietnam veteran, to bring an enactment of the Apollo 11 moon landing, as the US landing fears to need a plan B in the plausible event it fails and leaves the Russians win the race to space. The impostors initially take the cash and run, but once Jonny realizes the US government can't just be ignored and Kidman tracking them down, the only way out is hiring another director. They settle for 'artistic' junkies commune leader Renatus, and must now deal with the job, the band singer's dream project rock opera as cover, the loan shark en his enforcers and ultimately the impatient CIA's armed trouble shooter team.
