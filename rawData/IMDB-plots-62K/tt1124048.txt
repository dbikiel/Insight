A Bachelorette weekend goes awry when the girls are robbed, stranded, and forced to take shelter in a deserted Mexican resort that is haunted by the unspeakable atrocities of past.
Kathleen, a bride to be, and her four bridesmaids Sophia, Jessica, Beth, and Amber travel to Mexico in hopes of having a last "hoorah" before the wedding a few weeks away. After partying hard the night before, Sophia splits from the group to pursue Rob, a hansom young tourist from the states. The other girls decide to take a tour of the countryside without her, but are robbed and left for dead in a remote rugged terrain. As night falls, the tired and injured girls arrive at an abandon resort and decide to take shelter until morning. When they enter, strange things begin to happen, as the girls become overwhelmed by an unspoken evil that possesses the resort. Back in town, Sophia is worried about her friends and works hard to track them down. After realizing they took a scenic tour, Sophia and Rob do the same, in hopes of finding her lost friends. Sophia and Rob finally discover the resort and attempt to help their friends, but an unspeakable evil has taken control of all who travel to The Resort.
