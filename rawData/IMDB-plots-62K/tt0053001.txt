As Sadie Hawkins Day approaches, Daisy Mae hopes to win the hand of Li'l Abner by catching him in the traditional race. A senator comes to visit to tell the residents of Dogpatch that their town is to be used as an atomic bomb testing ground, unless they can find *something* necessary about the town. Could Mammy Yokum's Yokumberry tonic (which Abner has taken every day since he was a baby) be the key?
A comedy musical based on an earlier stage musical, which was in turn based on the comic strip characters created by Al Capp. When residents of Dogpatch, USA are notified by the government that they must evacuate, they try to persuade the government that their town is worth saving. Meanwhile, Earthquake McGoon wants to marry Daisy Mae; Daisy Mae wants to marry Li'l Abner, and Li'l Abner just wants to go fishing, until it is learned that Abner's Mammy's Yokumberry Tonic might be enough to save the town. Abner offers the tonic to Washington, but General Bullmoose wants it too, so Bullmoose tries to trap Abner into marrying his attractive but ditzy executive secretary, Appassionata. Meanwhile, Daisy Mae pledges herself to Earthquake in marriage in exchange for rescuing Abner from Bullmoose. Will Abner and Daisy Mae ever finally get together?
