After A US senator is killed, A Bomb Disposal Expert is brought in to investigate the deadly explosive and must uncover the terrorists plan.
Danny O'Neill is a bomb disposal expert assigned to a case where terrorists have developed an "invisible" liquid explosive which is activated within the human body. The targets of the terrorists are U.S. Senators, one of which is having an affair with Danny's wife.
When a Senator is killed in an explosion, the FBI investigates. The agent in charge is Danny O'Neill, who is separated from his wife and behaving very erratic. Initially the investigation doesn't reveal what kind of explosive or even what was used to detonate it. And it doesn't help that they have to report Senator Traveres, the man whom O'Neill's wife has been seen with and whom he also assaulted. After another Senator is killed, his driver who was responsible is caught and brought on trial. At his hearing another explosion occurs after the judge drinks some water.
