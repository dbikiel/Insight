After accepting a job as a caregiver in Italy, a young woman meets a man depressed over the end of his recent relationship.
This is a story about how love happens when the heart least expects it. Gara is a hardworking but bubbly OFW who still believes in destiny, romance, and true love, while the brooding Andrew is a guy who is simply too practical and jaded to believe in the rambles of fate. Would a seeming incompatibility keep them apart, or prove the theory that opposites do attract? How can Gara's faith in destiny and Andrew's indifference towards relationships help them understand and see love in a different way?
