Cheung's wife and boss are seeing each other, and decide to dispatch him with a wizard. But the wizard's rival aids and defends Cheung and a magic war rises.
Villager Bold Cheung (Sammo Hung Kam-Bo), known for his willingness to do anything courageous, bold or daring, becomes a target by the evil rich Master Tam (Huang Ha), who committed adultery with Cheung's unfaithful wife and wants to keep her as his mistress. Cheung is tricked into a bet to spend the night in a haunted temple, where a vampire was unleashed by Priest Chin Hoi (Lung Chan), hired by Tam, to kill him. However, Hoi's more righteous colleague, Priest Tsui (Fat Chung), wants to save Cheung and counterattack Hoi and Tam's wicked deeds.
