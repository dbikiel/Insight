Jimbo is 13 and can think of only one girl -- Sarah Jane. And no matter what stands in his way-bullies, violence, chaos, or zombies-nothing will stop him from finding a way into her world.
Jimbo is thirteen and he has a crush on Sarah Jane, the girl of his dreams. She still doesn't want to hear of him. But Jimbo is persistent. He will make Sarah Jane fall for him, no matter how long it must take. And what does he care if he lives in a post-apocalyptic environment? If all the adults are dead? If the place is infested with zombies? Jimbo loves Sarah Jane. That's that.
As far as the eye can see, chaos, mayhem and destruction plague the land, as a devastating virulent agent has rendered the earth an inhospitable prison for both the living and the dead. Now that Jimbo, an orphaned thirteen-year-old boy, has to fight all alone for his survival armed only with his bow and a few arrows, courtship is out of the question. But, this is Sarah Jane we are talking about--the only girl in the world (literally) who haunts Jimbo's fervent dreams. Under those circumstances, can love bloom on the battlefield?
