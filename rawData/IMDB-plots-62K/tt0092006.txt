Crew members aboard a space ship encounter an alien life form intent on killing them.
Set in 2032, as missions from Earth are being sent to explore Mars. After two groups of astronauts are mysteriously killed following the discovery of strange artefacts on the martian surface, the crew of the SC-37 go in to try and find out what happened. They soon learn what became of their predecessors when a bloodthirsty space monster begins lunching on members of the crew. Will any of them make it back to Earth alive?
This movie is bizarre... After finding a strange stone and keeping it on their ship, scientists traveling back to Earth dont realise it cracks open and gives birth to an alien that grows large and hideous. After killing half the crew by lurking around corridors and sneaking behind people, it establishes contact with the few who remain and... you'll never guess but they become buddies! and start to interact like friends would. The creature known as "Gar" reveals that he was only acting out of fear for its own life, and trying to protect itself in an unknown enviorment; hence all the bodies. Overall a very strange movie, with hard to accept visuals of the scientist getting killed, and a too easy acceptance of the Scientinst that remain that all their former workmates are now resting in the stomach of their new "friend".
