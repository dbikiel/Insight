As Hercule Poirot (Sir Peter Ustinov) enjoys a luxurious cruise down the Nile, a newlywed heiress is found murdered on board. Can Poirot identify the killer before the ship reaches the end of its journey?
Based on the Dame Agatha Christie novel, our favorite Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot (Sir Peter Ustinov), is on a cruise up the Nile. He is surrounded by an interesting assortment of characters, including a wealthy heiress and her husband, on their honeymoon. It appears that everyone hates the heiress.
Almost everyone on the S.S. Karnak, cruising the Nile, has a reason to want heiress Linnet Ridgeway (Lois Chiles) dead. Her jewels are coveted by elderly Mrs. Van Schuyler (Bette Davis), her maid is upset because Linnet won't give her a promised dowry, writer Salome Otterbourne (Dame Angela Lansbury) is facing a libel suit brought by Linnet, Salome's daughter Rosalie Otterbourne (Olivia Hussey) wants to protect her mother, American Andrew Pennington (George Kennedy) has been embezzling from the Ridgeway family, and former friend Jacqueline De Bellefort (Mia Farrow) is upset that Linnet stole her fianc√©, Simon Doyle (Simon MacCorkindale), away from her. Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot (Sir Peter Ustinov) must unravel the mystery when Linnet (and some of the others) turn up dead.
