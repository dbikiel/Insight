Larsen, an aspiring poet in 20's Oslo, leaves his girlfriend to spend a year as a trapper in East Greenland. There he is teamed with a seemingly rough old sailor/trapper, Randbek, and a scientist, Holm. Trapped in a tiny hut together as the arctic winter sets in, a complex and intense love/hate relationship develops between Randbek and Larsen, who are more similar than either would like to admit. A powerful psychological and physical drama set against stunningly bleak arctic scenery.
