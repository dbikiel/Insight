A newly elected District Attorney finds himself in the middle of a police corruption investigation that may involve his father and his partner.
Sean Casey is the newest member of the District Attorney's office and he is close to uncovering a police scandal that might involve his father Liam, who works for the N.Y.P.D. Then his father is critically wounded in a stake-out, Sean is chosen to prosecute the case.
Attorney Sean Cassey is called on by the New York District Attorney to try drug kingpin Jordon Washington, accused of murdering two cops and injuring a third, Sean's father. The publicity from the trial is a boom to Sean's career, but when Washington's lawyer, Sam Vigoda, makes accusations of police corruption that hit Sean too close to home, Sean is divided between justice, his career, and his family.
