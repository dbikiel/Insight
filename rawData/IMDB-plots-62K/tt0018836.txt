[For 9 minute surviving fragment] Lucian, a soldier in Paris, is to ship out for Algiers at 9 that evening. He stops by for a last meal with his love, Marianne. He may be worried that when he leaves she will find another soldier to love. They argue then embrace and, when the clock strikes midnight, he is still in her arms. Is desertion in the cards? Can the relationship survive the military demands and a soldier's obligations?
Lucien, a French soldier, deserts his regiment, steals, and serves a term in prison for Marianne, the girl he loves. Marianne becomes a great actress, but after Lucien serves his time, she breaks her contract as an actress and they go away to live on his ranch.
