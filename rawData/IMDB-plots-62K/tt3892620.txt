A teenager, with the ability to see ghosts, returns to his hometown to face his demons.
In-su, a high school student, can see ghosts. Plagued by them everywhere he goes and harassed by classmates because of it, he returns to his hometown to live with his uncle and finally put the past to rest. No sooner does he arrive than he sees his first ghost there, a pretty girl; but, just like before, it's not just ghosts that affect his life. School bullies remain a problem, but soon along, the bullies start being attacked by a vengeful ghost wearing a bloody mask, and In-su starts to think that his new friend, the pretty ghost, may have something to do with it.
