After enjoying a summer romance, high school students Danny and Sandy are unexpectedly reunited when she transfers to Rydell High. There Sandy must contend with cynical Rizzo and the Pink Ladies in attempt to win Danny's heart again.
Nearly four decades after Danny Zuko and Sandy Olsson's delicious youthful romance in legendary Grease (1978), Grease Live breathes new life into everyone's favourite teenage love affair; however, with a twist: the addition of a live audience. Once more, against the colourful backdrop of the iconic late-1950s Rydell High, the riotous gang of greasers, the T-Birds, and Betty Rizzo's delightfully sassy posse, the Pink Ladies, battle for attention, thirsting to become the coolest teams in school. Undoubtedly, this is going to be yet another year filled with passion, innocence, dance, affection, and teen energy, as the students set their mind on excelling in the much-awaited live dance contest. In this high school graduation day, GREASE is still the word.
