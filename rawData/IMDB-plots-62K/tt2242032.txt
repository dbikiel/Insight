Set in a fabulous lakeside palazzo-cum-hotel circa 1907, the intrigue shifts points of view between a young British milquetoast, Bernard (Harry Lister Smith) and the supposedly enchanting Natalia Solario (Marie Féret), whom he quickly falls for, only to learn that the tight-lipped Madame harbors some very dark secrets. These soon come to light when her brother, Eugene (Cyril Descours), unexpectedly shows up, preceded by rumors that he tried to kill their father-in-law, who supposedly made advances (and more) towards his sister. Also on hand is a filthy rich Russian (Andrei Zayats) whose short temper is only quelled by his ridiculous accent, and a giggly vixen (Salomé Stévenin) who annoyingly bursts into song as a means of seduction.
