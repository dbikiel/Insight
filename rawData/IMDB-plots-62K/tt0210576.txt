The tensions experienced by three different people during the military dictatorship in Brazil: a politician, a revolutionary and a common citizen.
When there's a crisis in power, the man who holds this power is also personally disturbed. His defeat is thorough and complete. A dictator, in a moment of serious national crisis, confronted in the streets and countryside by revolt and guerilla, makes a long speech on TV, looking for an illusionary peace. But reality is stronger than his fiction, and control gets out of hand. For him, there's only one way out: a pathetic confession and going off the air.
