As part of a maiden public film screening at the Salon Indien, on December 28, in Paris, Auguste Lumière pivots the centre of attention around his baby daughter, as he tries to feed her from a spoon.
A baby is seated at a table between its cheerful parents, Auguste and Marguerite Lumière. While the father is feeding the baby with a spoon, the mother is pouring coffee into her cup. The father gives the baby a biscuit, which the baby grabs, but doesn't eat, although both parents encourage it. The father resumes feeding the baby with the spoon.
In their flower-scented spring garden in 1895, Auguste and Marguerite Lumière along with their baby daughter, Andrée, attempt probably the first-ever home-movie as part of a maiden public film screening at the Salon Indien, on December 28, in Paris. Depicting a warm scene in the life of a family, the patriarch Lumière pivots the centre of attention around his beautiful child, as he tries to feed her from a spoon and then offers her a biscuit. In the end, as little Andrée looks straight into the camera, she provides the viewers with an unexpected twist.
