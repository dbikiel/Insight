Alex, a lovable, unassuming dog trainer is in love with a great woman - Katherine - smart, talented, from a good family. Katherine adores Alex's quirky sense of humor, honesty and capacity to listen. Having decided to pop the question, Alex is blindsided when Katherine produces a detailed list of well-thought-out "improvements" she feels will tweak Alex on their way to becoming the ideal couple. Alex instinctively rejects the suggestion that he needs to change anything. But with the threat of a new competitor, Alex decides to "do the list." Guided by a coterie of friends that include: Dave, Alex's loyal childhood buddy, best female friend Lily, her husband Michael, and their 8-year-old son, Nicky, Alex's journey has him reconsider and question his beliefs, values and world.
Katherine Stern (Jennifer Morrison) gives her boyfriend Alex (Patrick Fugit) a list of all the things she wants him to change about himself. He works through the list sidekicked by his best friend, the neurotic single-mom Lily (Karen Gillan). But as Alex tries to complete the list, it leads him to the eventual realization that maybe there should never be a list at all.
