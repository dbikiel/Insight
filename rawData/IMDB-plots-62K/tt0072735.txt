John Deakin is being transported, as a prisoner, on a train with supplies and medicine to Fort Humboldt, Nevada.
Train with medical supplies and small U.S. Army unit is heading through Rocky mountains towards plagued Fort Humboldt. Among its passengers are territory governor, priest, doctor and U.S. Marshal with his prisoner, John Deakin. However, nothing on that train is what it seems.
With the intention of relieving the troops of the Fort Humboldt garrison from a sudden outburst of diphtheria, an express train is dispatched, carrying reinforcement soldiers and medical supplies through the frozen West across the Rocky Mountains. Aboard the special train are the Governor Richard Fairchild who is escorting the outpost commander's daughter, Marica, the troopers' captain, Major Claremont, Marshal Pearce and his mysterious prisoner, the fearful outlaw, John Deakin. However, in this well-guarded and confined space, before long, missing officers and unexplained deaths will begin to shroud the mission with mystery and suspicion, as the invisible killer among them seems unstoppable. Undoubtedly, a dark conspiracy unfolds. Is there anyone capable enough of exposing it?
When a military outpost is struck with a severe outbreak of diphtheria, the authorities send a train loaded with medical supplies and replacement soldiers. As the train is on its way however, a passenger is murdered. And then two passengers; then the entire human cargo of several cars. John Deakin, a man under arrest and being transported to custody, does some digging to find out the reason for the carnage.
