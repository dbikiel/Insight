An unusual boxing match.
A musical parody that ridicules unworthy techniques and means used by professional boxers for the sake of winning. The character's speech itself is meaningless, but phonetically, the construction of phrases resembles speech in Italian (white) and English (brown, judge and speaker) languages. In this case, the judge pronounces the real phrase in Spanish - Hasta ma√±ana.
