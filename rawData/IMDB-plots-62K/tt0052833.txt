The stay in the prison of Eudosio and Carlos, accused unjustly, prevents them from getting a job when they go free. As much as they intend to explain that they were locked up for no reason, nobody will listen to them. So they decide to steal to stay alive. His house is a whole building in ruins, without any closed window and with the walls that are barely standing. Esperanza will try to turn that space into a home, where she works with enthusiasm. But life is very hard and coexistence is also difficult.
