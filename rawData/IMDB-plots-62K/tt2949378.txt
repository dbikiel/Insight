The gruesome story behind the Moors Murders.
In the mid 1960s, the crimes of Moors Murderers Ian Brady and Myra Hindley became a byword for pure, unspeakable evil. The abduction, torture, murder and burial on the moors of the children and young teenagers who were their victims stunned and horrified the British public. This film uses archival footage, dramatic reconstruction and interviews with the police officers and families of the victims to tell a story of utter horror.
