Former Marshal Will Kane returns to Hadleyville a year after he resigned and finds the town in the grip of a tyrannical Marshal who abuses his power.
Will Kane returns to his hometown of Hadleyville with his wife Amy for the first time in years since his famous gunfight with Frank Miller and his gang to face a new menace of his town in the grip of a bounty-hunting Marshal named J.D. Ward and his two gun-happy Deputies pursuing Ben Irons, a drifter wanted dead or alive for a crime he didn't commit whom he asks Kane to help him which sets the stage for a second major gunfight within the town.
Will Kane goes back to the town where he was the Marshal to get some horses he ordered. He meets the man who replaced him and doesn't get a good impression. When he goes to get the horses, he runs into a man whom he arrested when he was Marshal. Later, the new Marshal shows up and orders the man to come out, but he doesn't, so the Marshal starts shooting, hitting the horses Will bought. When it's over, the Marshal doesn't apologize. Will learns the man spends more time hunting down bounties than he does enforcing the law. Will then goes out to find the man blaming him for what happened. He tells Will he didn't do what he is wanted for. Will decides to stay with him with the Marshal on their tail.
