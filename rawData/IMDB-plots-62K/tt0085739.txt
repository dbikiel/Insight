The summer of an ice hockey player.
A small Finnish town in the 1950s. Young ice-hockey player Illu spends his idle summer months hanging around local restaurants, just like the gorgeous-looking blonde Salme he and every other male in town is in love with. With not too much effort, handsome Illu manages to score the independent and wisecracking woman, quite a bit older than himself, and gradually discovers a softer side behind her edgy fa√ßade.
