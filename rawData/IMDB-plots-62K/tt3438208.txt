Life is fraught with debilitating panic attacks, rages, doctors and medications. The family must play an integral role in finding the help he desperately needs, but the toll it takes is devastating. Ultimately, love, strength and courage will prevail to reveal the resiliency of the human spirit.
 
Timothys journey is a familiar story for many families, who suffer alone and in silence as they strive to understand and find help for their children. The pervasive stigma surrounding mental illness prevents people from seeking the help they need. "No Letting Go" is a story that must be told to promote open dialogue about the importance of understanding mental health among the youth in our society. Only awareness and open dialogue can fight stigma, leading to better outcomes for future generations.
