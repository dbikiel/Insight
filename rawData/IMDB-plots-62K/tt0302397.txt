Shows all the prominent buildings on this thoroughfare, ending with a close view of the base of the Eiffel Tower, with the Trocadero Palace in the background.
It's a sunny day at the 1900 Paris Exposition. Women wearing hats and carrying parasols stroll alone and in groups. The camera begins a panoramic shot. A man in a boater stares at the camera as women in full-length skirts walk by. The base of the Eiffel Tower comes into view, with crowds walking under it. The camera pauses and we see the Palace of Electricity beyond, under the arch of the tower's base. The panoramic shot continues.
