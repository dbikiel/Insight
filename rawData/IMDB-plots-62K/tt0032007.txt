Five years after the crash, a party from England arrive looking for the crash site and in the feint hope that there may have been survivors. Led by Sir Thomas Lancing, it seems that Boy has inherited a large fortune and wants to to take him back to England. Tarzan won't hear of it but Jane realizes that it may be in the child's best interest to return, even if it will break her heart. Her decision may end her relationship with her mate however.

Now, almost five years later, a searching party arrives led by Sir Thomas Lancing. Along with him comes a conniving duo of opportunists who will stop at nothing to get Tarzan out of the way, and take Boy back to England; nevertheless, the mighty Lord of the Jungle is not alone. Can Tarzan thwart their plans, and keep his beloved only son?
