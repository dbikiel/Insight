A pack of dogs go on a killing spree.
On the quiet campus of the remotely-located SouthwesternUniversity, something strange is happening; all of the dogs in the area, once loyal, gentle pets, are now banding together in wild, feral packs and hunting down their former masters. Could the strange transformation have anything to do with the secret government experiements being conducted in the school's physics laboratory? More importantly, can the dogs be stopped before it's too late?
