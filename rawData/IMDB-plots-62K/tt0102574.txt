In a dreary Russian village, over-enthusiastic and underappreciated Kolya spontaneously announces that he has plans to leave for the far-east today, garnering far more attention and support than he anticipated.
Early Sunday morning in a small Soviet town. Loitering in idleness, Kolya is hanging around and bothering the townsfolk with goofy talk. As no-one shares his enthusiasm, he decides to visit his friend Fyodor. Kolya finds him weary and indifferent. In an attempt to catch his attention, Kolya breaks the news: he's about to leave for the Russian Far East. Surprisingly, this decision of him gets overwhelming support; Kolya becomes a local hero, and all his neighbors suddenly get involved in seeing him off. Those materialistic ones start buying Kolya's furniture, as Fyodor convinces his friend to write a letter of resignation
