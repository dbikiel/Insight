When two best friends develop a crush on the same boy, they develop a plan to trick him into dating them.
Upon entering high school, two best friends named Hana and Alice notice a boy a year older them while waiting for the train, and they both develop a pretty strong crush on him. One day while secretly following him home, Hana witnesses the boy walk right into a wall and pass out. When he wakes up, she lies and convinces him that he must have amnesia, because he doesn't remember the fact that she was his girlfriend. After this, hilarity ensues as the two girls attempt to run with the lie. Of course, complications soon arise.
When free-spirited Alice develops a crush on a random stranger at the train station, she offers her best friend Hana the guy's "half brother". Hana declines, but soon develops feelings for the strange boy. Later, when they enter high school, Hana joins the storytelling club, and her crush, Masashi, is in it too. Upon witnessing him hit his head on a garage door, she lies and says she is his girlfriend. A series of events follow, and a subtle triangle develops between Hana, Alice and Masashi. Despite outward appearances, this film isn't just about puppy love, it also tells the story of friendship between two girls, and the different situations in their lives (especially in Alice's family situation). So don't write off this movie just yet!
