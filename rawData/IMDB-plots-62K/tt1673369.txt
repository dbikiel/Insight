The Bible is full of strange and fantastic creatures. Legendary and horrific beasts like the Behemoth and Leviathan have captivated our imagination for centuries - did they really exist, can they be found today or are they just myth? New investigations into the origins of these beasts have uncovered shocking truths. For centuries there have been monsters hiding from us in plain sight. Welcome to the world of Beasts of the Bible, a new documentary that explores the most extraordinary creatures in the Biblical tales. For the first time, investigators delve into the origins of these mysterious creatures and examine the scientific facts behind their actual existence. Creatures such as the serpent in the Garden of Eden, the sea monster that swallowed Jonah, and the terrifying four-headed, multi-winged angel that appeared to the prophet Ezekiel. Beasts Of The Bible is an intensely visual experience. Using a variety of the latest CGI techniques, the film brings miraculous beasts to life - some leap from the pages of medieval manuscripts, others manifest from stars in the night sky, becoming "real" before our eyes. Along the way cryptozoologists, herpetologists, historians and archaeologists guide the investigation, searching for the creatures that may have inspired the early writers of the Bible.
