A cellist in a small orchestra receives help from animals to help him practice his music.
Beginner Goshu is practicing to improve as a cellist, but is scolded by his tutor who finds him flat and out of rhythm. Arriving home and determined to practice more he is visited by four animals who, in turn, work and practice with him to improve his ability. Each of these animals acts as a spirit guide to Goshu and motivate and cajole him in different ways. The artwork and music lend themselves to the music and the progressive improvement in the young cellist.
