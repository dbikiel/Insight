A Southern mobster attempts to rescue his kidnapped brother.
A powerful action thriller, ARSENAL tells the intertwining stories of the Lindel brothers, Mikey (Johnathon Schaech) and JP (Adrian Grenier), who had only each other to rely on growing up. As adults, JP found success as the owner of a construction company, while Mikey became a small-time mobster, mired in a life of petty crime. When Mikey is kidnapped and held for a ransom by ruthless crime boss Eddie King (Nicolas Cage), JP turns to the brothers' old pal Sal (John Cusack), a plain clothes detective for help. In order to rescue his brother, JP must risk everything and unleash his vengeance against King's relentless army of gangsters.
After surviving a poor and hard childhood in Biloxi, Mississippi, solely by sticking together, the Lindel brothers--the protective big brother, Mikey, and the wide-eyed, JP--go their separate ways. With Mikey struggling to eke out an existence as a small-time crook, and JP sweating in his small construction company, one bad decision will have the boys owing to the violent mobster, Eddie King, who abducts Mikey. Now, with the aid of the plain-clothes detective, Sal, JP must fight tooth and nail to save his older brother, as the clock is ticking. However, even for Mikey's sake, can JP turn into a furious avenger?
