The idyllic, rural past of a Suffolk village comes to life through the memories of an old man who tends a country graveyard, in this extraordinary, film directed by David Gladwell. Although best known for his celebrated work as editor on Lindsay Anderson's If.... and O Lucky Man!, Gladwell has, until now, rarely been recognised as the director of a number of ground-breaking films. This title is also available on DVD / Blu-ray in the BFI's Flipside collection.
