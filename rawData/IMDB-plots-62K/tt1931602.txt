Two New York City girls make a pact to lose their virginity during their first summer out of high school. When they both fall for the same street artist, the friends find their connection tested for the first time.
The summer before college presents two best friends, Lilly and Gerri, with the opportunity to shed their good girl images. Both girls want to lose their virginity and explore another side of who they are. But their dark and different home lives and the introduction of a bad boy, threaten to destroy their friendship without it being the nice coming-of-age summer that the two girls envisioned.
