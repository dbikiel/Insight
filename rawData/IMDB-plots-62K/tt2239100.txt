It has been two years since John Falk and Frank Wagner broke their cooperation and Frank stopped working undercover for the police. Frank has just had: Re-opening of his bar when his former girlfriend's brother Kevin ends up in trouble because of gambling debts. At the same time Johan and GSI Group, together with the German police, busted an unusually reckless league selling a new type of drug that is hard on young people. Frank's quest for Kevin crosses Johan's investigation and opens up a new collaboration between them - with the major difference that this time it's personal for Frank. Johan and GSI are forced to stage a second operation to entrap leaders of the drug gang. The situation becomes even more dangerous because there is another infiltrator in the game.
