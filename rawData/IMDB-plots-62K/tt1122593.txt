With "Gentleman's Agreement" as his jumping off point, Jamie Kastner asks who's a Jew, and does it matter. He'll answer the question, "Are you Jewish?" with a yes to see how people react. Brooklyn's Hassidic community embraces him and gives him a bar mitzvah. He visits Pat Buchanan who ends their conversation abruptly when Kastner presses Buchanan on whether all Jews are alike. He travels to Israel, London, Paris, Berlin, and Krakow talking to Jews about how they are seen by others and asking non-Jews what they think of Jews. He then goes to Auschwitz where he refuses to be a tourist. He ends the trip at his local bagel shop. Virtually everywhere, he finds irony and prejudice.
