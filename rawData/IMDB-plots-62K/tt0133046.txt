The school's outcast, Luke Churner (Barry Watson), snatches Tingle's upcoming test answers and delivers them to Leigh Ann. Mrs. Tingle finds them in Leigh Ann's bag and reports it to the Principal, who, luckily, was not present. That night, Leigh Ann; her friend, Jo Lynn Jordan (Marisa Coughlan); and Luke visit Mrs. Tingle's house to reason and confront her. The conversation ends in a deadly accident. Leigh Ann and her friends clean up the place and carry Mrs. Tingle's unconscious body to her bed and tie her up. She wakes up and the three students try and compromise, but does Mrs. Tingle just want to loosen them up before her own attack?
