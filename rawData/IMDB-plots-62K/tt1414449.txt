When Jim - a disenchanted yet highly popular college professor - learns of his father's death, he must track down his deadbeat brother Dave and deliver him to the funeral. Upon arrival, they both learn that they've each inherited one half of the family's vacation home in Branson, Missouri, and in order to sell the house - from which they both badly need the money - they'll need to travel down to Branson, and the ensuing trip both fixes their house, as well as their relationship.
