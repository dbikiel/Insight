A drug industry has gained a huge popularity in the United States and Eastern Europe. In response, FSB has been organizing underground operations to infiltrate the most notorious drug gangs in that region. Meanwhile, a huge drug operation is being led by a mysterious crime group in Russia. Two special agents try to investigate, but one of them has his family taken hostages by the mob and is being blackmailed. All the suspicions lead to the international drug cartel led by an American crime boss and a former U.S. Special Forces member.
