The script by Eva Borusevicova describes the true story of Janosik, the XVIII centuries outlaw, who was prowling through Slovak-Polish border. The story of Janosik, a legendary "Central European Robin Hood", based on a real XVIII century documents and on a romantic legend, operating with a very subjective, original lyricism: the hero is tragic and at the same time very contemporary: he could be an American boy, burned by communing with cruelty of the war comes back from Iraq to the city ghetto and becomes a leader of a gang.
