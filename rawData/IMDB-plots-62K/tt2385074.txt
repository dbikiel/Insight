Thanatomorphose is an hellenic word meaning the visible signs of an organism's decomposition caused by death. One day, a young and beautiful girl a wakes up and finds her flesh rotting.
Inexplicably, a lively young woman is slowly dying. What started as a rash and a grotesque dark bruise, it keeps spreading, and, even though she still holds on, a terrible scourge is eating her alive from the inside. Now, her job at the hospital, her friends, and her love life have all become fractions of a once-regular life, as, sooner or later, her body will blemish from the blooming flowers of decay, and the stigmata of an unfathomable punishment that demands a transcendental change. Little by little--as the festering wounds claim the remaining flesh--the woman finds herself reduced to a mere fragment of her former self, with a few grim Polaroids being the only remnants of her existence. Inevitably, before Death's omnipotence, any resistance is futile, as the feeble and malleable flesh succumbs to life's ultimate truth: what was once alive, undoubtedly, shall perish.
