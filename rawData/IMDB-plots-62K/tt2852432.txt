An embittered law student commits a brutal double murder; a family man takes the fall and is forced into a harsh prison sentence; a mother and her two children wander the countryside looking for some kind of redemption.
The lives of three people take a turn when one of them commits a crime: Joaquin is failing miserably at providing for his family. When his loan-shark Magda gets murdered, the crime is pinned on him. Misery and solitude transform him in prison. Left to fend for the family after a serious leg injury, his wife Eliza pours all of her strength to battling with despair and eking out a living for their two children. The real perpetrator, Fabian, a hothead student who holds forth on the subject of atheism and anarchism to his long-suffering friends roams free. His disillusionment with his country-its history of revolutions marred by betrayal and crimes unpunished-drives him to the edge of sanity. He is absorbed in guilt, gives Joaquin's destitute wife some money and asks his friends to do their best for Joaquin. Then he rapes his own God-fearing sister and kills the dog.
