Man about town and First Class cricketer A.J. Raffles keeps himself solvent with daring robberies. Meeting Gwen from his schooldays and falling in love all over again, he spends the weekend with her parents, Lord and Lady Melrose. A necklace presents an irresistible temptation, but also in attendance is Scotland Yard's finest, finally on the trail.
A.J. Raffles is a gentleman thief with a penchant for art and jewelry. Known as the Amateur Cracksman, his most recent caper was to steal an Old Master painting from the National Art Gallery, something the newspapers treat as headline news. Gentleman that he is however, he sends the painting to a now retired actress whose farewell performance he once admired so she can claim the reward. After meeting his old school chum's sister Gwen, he becomes a reformed man. Crossed wires lead Scotland Yard to believe Lord and lady Melrose are Raffles' next victims and Inspector MacKenzie is soon at their country house for the weekend, as is Raffles. There is a burglar about, Crawshay, but Raffles manages to turn the tables on him. MacKenzie suspects Raffles however and a game of cat and mouse ensues.
