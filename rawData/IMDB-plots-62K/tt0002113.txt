Aboard the futuristic flying machine of his own invention, Professor Mabouloff and his team of intercultural explorers set off on yet another impossible expedition to North Pole's vast landscapes. What wonders await the bold adventurers?
Nearly one decade after his extraordinary feat in Le voyage Ã  travers l'impossible (1904), the indefatigable and unorthodox engineering scientist, Professor Mabouloff, convinces his esteemed colleagues at the International Aero Club Congress to join him on yet another impossible expedition: a journey to the vast landscapes of the North Pole. Aboard the futuristic flying machine of his own invention, the intercultural explorers weed out the fierce competition and zoom off to the densely-occupied skies, until the team lands at the glacial terrains of their final destination. What wonders await the bold adventurers?
Scientists from all over the world are meeting to discuss the best way to reach the North Pole. Professor Maboul demonstrates for them the innovative equipment that he has designed for the purpose. When everything is ready, Maboul and several other scientists depart for the pole. Their trip will prove to be even more eventful than expected.
