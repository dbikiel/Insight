A french girl gifted with a great voice, has a complex about her weight and her appearance.
Lolita, plump, in her 20s, desperately wants her father's attention. He's egotistical, a famous writer and publisher with an attractive wife little older than Lolita. She's in a choir, rehearsing for a concert; she's given her father a tape, which he's yet to listen to. Sylvia, a voice coach, is willing to help the group, knowing she'll have a chance to get her husband's new novel in front of Lolita's father. For Lolita, this is a pattern: people pay attention to her to gain access to him, something she fears is the intent of Sébastien, a struggling journalist who may become her boyfriend. The night of the concert, the music may bring out everyone's feelings.
Lolita is a very gifted singer, and she's preparing for a recital with other companions. But Lolita, despite her great voice, lives with a complex about her obesity and because her father, Étienne, a famous writer, doesn't care about her and hardly knows about her talent. Lolita's teacher, Sylvia, is and admirer of Étienne's work nearly the point of idealize him. Lolita and Silvia, whose husband is also a writer and Étienne's best friend, become closer friends. The girl will learn to accept herself, give her best at the recital and maybe make up with Étienne, while Silvia will see that her admired writer is not what she believes.
