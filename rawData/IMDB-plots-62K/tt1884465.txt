A young woman is kidnapped by a mysterious stranger and chained in an eerie, dilapidated barn. Unwilling to play the victim, she plots a daring escape. With thirst and hunger bearing down, her grip on reality loosens. Can she free herself from the chain and the haunting visions? Why is she here? Is that strange presence outside the barn her imagination or the reason for her capture?
Calico Cooper stars as a kidnapped woman depending upon her wits, intelligence, and stamina to survive six days without food or water. Chained by a thirty proof coil to a post in a century-old barn, she battles her demons - real and imagined - as she sinks deeper into despair.
