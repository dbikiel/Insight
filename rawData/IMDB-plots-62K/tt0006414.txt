Charlie is an overworked labourer at a film studio who helps a young woman find work even while his coworkers strike against his tyrannical boss.
Three movies are being shot simultaneously and Charlie is an overworked scene shifter. The foreman is waited on hand and foot until all the shifters but Charlie go on strike. A girl looking for work pretends to be a man and helps Charlie. Charlie discovers her gender and falls in love with her. The foreman thinks they are homosexual and in the ensuing fight they become involved in a long pie throwing scene from one of the movies in production. The frustrated workers dynamite the studio.
Eager to break into the lustrous movie industry, Edna, an aspiring actress, asks a busy director for a role, only to be instantly rejected. In the meantime, Charlie--an overzealous stagehand who works his fingers to the bone while his intimidating boss prefers to sit and nap--somehow manages to utterly destroy several stage settings, as a desperate young man offers a lending hand amid a general workers' strike. But, who is this mysterious lad? Furthermore, will Charlie ever get rid of his bullying manager?
