A girl finally confessed her love, but she retracted it as a joke when her love interest did not show any reaction. She will need to gather up her courage to confess for real.
Natsuki Enomoto, a third-year student at Sakuragaoka High School, has feelings of unrequited love for her childhood friend, Yuu Setoguchi. Unable to be true to her own feelings, Natsuki tells Yuu that she is merely using him as a stand-in to practice confessing her love to. As Natsuki continues to pretend not having any feelings for Yuu, her classmate Koyuki Ayase asks her out on a date. Will Natsuki ever be able to stop "practicing" and actually confess her love to Yuu?
