Hunted down by six teams of assassins hired by a Japanese crime lord, Federal agents Donna and Nicole struggle to survive, with help from their agency friends.
Two beautiful American special agents are given a head start by an oriental crime boss. The head start is to get away from the teams of assassins he has lined up to kill them. Numerous visual costume changes later, the busty duo team up with other agents to make a convenient team of eight, all paired off in a boy/girl manner.
In the middle of a traditional Hawaiian feast, the Federal agents, Donna and Nicole, have an unexpected encounter with the megalomaniac criminal, Masakana "Kane" Kaneshiro, who manages to plant a tiny bug on Donna's wristwatch during their "friendly" chat. Meanwhile, at the Â¼ Scale Association Air Show held in the Las Vegas Desert, an undercover associate introduces the Agency with a state-of-the-art crime-fighting weapon in the shape of an agile, remote-controlled helicopter armed with a pair of heat-seeking missiles. As Donna and Nicole rush to Louisiana to assemble with the rest of the team after a narrow escape from death, the paranoid Masakana plans to control the American Stock Market. Now, more than ever, the Agency needs to stop the deranged kingpin's plot, with the final chapter to be concluded in the swamps of Louisiana.
