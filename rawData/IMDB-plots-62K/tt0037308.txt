That wascawwy wabbit is chased into a theatre by Elmer Fudd, and ends up having to perform to save himself, as well as convince Elmer to act himself. The vaudeville industry was never this wacky!
Elmer Fudd tries to catch Bugs Bunny by putting a carrot on a fish hook, but Bugs turns the tables on Elmer by attaching the hook to his pants, so that when Elmer thinks he has got a bite, he ends up reeling himself in.A furious Elmer pursues Bugs to a vaudeville theatre, where Bugs performs a series of tricks themed on entertainment on Elmer. Bugs disguises himself as a can-can dancer, but Elmer sees through this disguise. Among the tricks Bugs is able to successfully pull on Elmer are getting him to perform a high-diving act into a glass of water, and performing an on-stage striptease down to his boxers.Bugs then disguises himself as a southern sheriff at the very moment that a real southern sheriff arrives at the theatre and arrests Elmer for "indecent southern exposure". They are about to leave the theatre when a Bugs Bunny cartoon begins to play on the stage's movie screen. The sheriff, who dotes on Bugs' doings, decides to stay and watch it. The cartoon shows Bugs Bunny putting on a sheriff's disguise, which gives Elmer the idea that the sheriff beside him is actually Bugs Bunny, so Elmer disrobes him only to find that he is in fact a real sheriff. As the angry sheriff grabs his shotgun and uses it to lead Elmer out of the theatre, the orchestra conductor takes off his wig, which reveals him as Bugs, who then conducts the band into a big finale.
