Slip (Leo Gorcey) and Sach (Huntz Hall) lose their jobs with a laundry company after they wreck the delivery truck. They talk Louie (Bernard Gorcey) into using the back room of his Malt Shop for a laundromat. Laura Andrews (Anabel Shaw) leaves her baby wrapped in a bundle at the launderette to hide him from her neurotic aunts, Hope (Ida Moore)and Faith Andrews (Florence Auer), who have Laura committed to a sanitarium in a plot to gain the rich estate left by their brother to his grandson, Laura's baby. Sach finds the baby and the Bowery Boys hold onto him because of Laura's note that she will return. Meanwhile, mobster "Bananas" Stewart (Gabriel Dell sees the baby and he and "Cherry-Nose" inform the aunts that they will return him for the offered $25,000 reward. The aunts offer them an additional $25,000 if they will keep him hidden until after the will is read. Slip does not see this as a good plan, and investigates the matter further.
While working in a laundromat, the boys find a baby hidden among the linen. They soon find out that the baby, heir to a fortune, has been abandoned by his mother so that her two evil aunts can't cheat them out of their inheritance. The boys determine to help the woman claim her baby's rightful inheritance from her aunts, who have hired gangsters to find and eliminate the girl, the baby, and anyone who helps them.
