While honoring the daughter's death, a long con, an axe-wielding serial killer, and a vengeful ghost all coalesce in the same night to target the family.

This year, horrible secrets that threaten to resurface, blemish the annual memorial. What sinister mystery lies within the thick stone walls of the silent Castle Haloran?
