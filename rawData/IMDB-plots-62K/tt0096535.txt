A Victorian Age English gentleman takes a wager that he can circle the globe in the unprecedented time of just eighty days.
Phileas Fogg (Pierce Brosnan) accepts a wager to prove his contention that a man can go around the world in eighty days. After betting his entire fortune, he takes his new butler Jean Passepartout (Eric Idle) (a man hoping for a quite life) on a tour of the world. However, just before the time he leaves, the Bank of England is robbed, and a Detective believes that Fogg is the guilty party, and he sets out after him.
