Two drunks live in the same hotel. One beats his wife, the other is beaten by his. They go off and get drunk together. They try to sleep in a restaurant using tables as beds and are thrown out. They lie down in a row boat which fills with water, drowning them (a fate apparently better than going home to their wives).
Two men are mistreated by their wives in their respective rooms and chased out of the house. The two wives and the two husbands confront each other in moments of agitation.The two men go to the restaurant, behaving as if they were at home: one of them spreads his feet, the other leans on another client. Charlot takes a tablecloth as a sheet and lies on the floor. The wives reach the husbands at the restaurant: they beat them and put them on the run. The two men reach a canoe and lie on it sinking into the water.
