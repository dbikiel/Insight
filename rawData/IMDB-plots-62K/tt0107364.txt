One man's quest for revenge in a post-apocalyptic world
After an environmental disaster, the arctic regions of Scandinavia have become a wasteland, a battlefield for the army and rebels' guerrilla troops. A bunch of crooks with motorbikes, lead by 'Duke', is terrorizing the civilians. An escaped prisoner, Jake, has personal reasons for killing Duke, and he gets help from the locals, including a girl suffering of amnesia and a harmless nutcase. The time for payback is to come, but Duke has decided to strike first.
