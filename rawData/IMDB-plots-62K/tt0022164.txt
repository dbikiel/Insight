An extremely large Old King Cole sings his story. His "fiddlers three" turn out to be the Three Blind Mice. And his book is Mother Goose, which illustrates Little Miss Muffett, Jack and Jill (they meet Simple Simon at the top of the hill), Humpty Dumpty, Little Jack Horner (his pie also contains the four-and-twenty blackbirds), Little Bo Peep, Little Boy Blue (his horn brings the sheep home, one of which falls in black mud and becomes Baa Baa Black Sheep), and Hey Diddle Diddle.
