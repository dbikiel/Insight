In the near future, instead of being sent to prison criminals are aged for the number of years the system feels is adequate to the crime they committed. Vincent Dawson is a 15 year old, whose late father was a musician who didn't exactly make it and died tragically. Vinnie hopes to be a musician too but his step-father is not very supportive, and when they have a violent argument, his step-father is killed and he is the prime suspect and evidence is found against him. He is sentenced to be aged 30 years. Now, as a 15 year old trapped in a 45 year old body, he sets to prove his innocence and hopefully the procedure could be reversed.
