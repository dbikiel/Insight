Batman goes on vacation and chaos erupts in Gotham.
Fighting crime is a full-time job and Batman NEVER takes a vacation. That is until he finally agrees to let Batgirl and Nightwing take him on a long overdue trip - leaving Gotham City under the watchful eye of the Justice League in LEGOÂ® DC Comics Super Heroes - Justice League: Gotham City Breakout. When Batgirl and Nightwing take Batman on a trip down memory lane - literally - to visit one of the key mentors from his formative years, it's up to the Justice League to keep Gotham City crime-free. But neither situation proves to be a "vacation" as the Bat trio encounters old nemeses on their adventure, and the Justice League discovers just how busy Batman is on a regular basis. It's a brick-tastic battle on two fronts as Batman, Batgirl and Nightwing take on Bane and Deathstroke, while the Justice League - with some help from a few Teen Titans - fends off an assault by many of Batman's infamous adversaries to ensure Gotham City's safety.
