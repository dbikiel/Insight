Five young people are involved in a serious car accident that leaves four of them dead. Isabel, the youngest, is the only survivor and helps her four friends realize they have passed on.
Taking a nap in the middle of the woods after walking by herself, young adult Isa awakens to meet up with fellow young adult friends Arturo, Felix, Niki and Sofi, all who continue their walk through the woods. Largely filling their time by playing a language game of coming up with truthful six word phrases, they are lost but seemingly unconcerned even when they find themselves in places where they know they've been already on this journey. Despite not remembering where they started (i.e. in the real world, where they parked their car), they do have some benchmarks on which they can refer, mainly Niki's tape recording of their entire journey, which is played over the baroque music he also has on the tape. They also have a map, which they realize is in Sofi's backpack, and the house by the lagoon, which may or may not be facing the sea, as other benchmarks. They also know that they can reach the sea if they work their way downhill. Through their journey, their fundamental differences as people both bring them together and build walls between them.
