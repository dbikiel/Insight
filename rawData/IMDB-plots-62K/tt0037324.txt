Patra, the Sultan's daughter, has inherited all the oil lands of Araband following the death of her mother. The Sultan wants to sign them over to Rata and Ludwig, German agents, but Patra says she will only sign them to Americans. Kuda, the Sultan's right-hand man, actually in league with Rata and Ludwig, wishes to marry Patra, but she refuses. Patra and her best friend and teacher, an American named Irene, visit the city incognito, and there meet Americans Jimmy and Tim. Kuda hires them to talk Patra into signing over the oil leases to him and they, not knowing he is working for the Nazis, agree to try.
