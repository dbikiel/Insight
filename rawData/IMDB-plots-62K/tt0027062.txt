The Swedenhielms is an old aristocratic family. The head of the family is professor Rolf Swedenhielm. His three children Bo, Julia and Rolf Jr also live in the house. They also have an excellent house maid, Boman. Because of the family's extravagance, they are heading for bankruptcy. But perhaps their problems would be solved if Rolf was awarded the Nobel Prize?
The widower and famous chemist Rolf Swedenhielm lives with his adult children Rolf Jr, Julia and Bo in a big apartment in Stockholm. The self-image of the Swedenhielm family is one of noblesse, grandeur and idealism, but in reality the family is bankrupt. All their hope is centered on the father winning the Nobel Prize, which would save their economy, but this seems unlikely at the moment. The one who keeps the family going is the housekeeper Marta Boman, who does the cooking, the cleaning and even effects financial transactions in the background. Rolf Swedenhielm is proud of the high and unwavering standards of the family. When a usurer reveals to him that his signature has been forged on several bills, and one of his sons is suspected of the crime, his world collapses and he sinks into a heavy gloom.
