Set in a post-9/11 America, four Americans come together to build a truck bomb and plan to detonate it on a target in the U.S. Highlighting the days leading up to the event.
The Insurgents, a political thriller in the vein of Arlington Road and The Spy Who Came in From The Cold, questions about our views on terrorism by exploring what drives people to do appalling acts. The film depicts four Americans come together to build a truck bomb and plan to detonate it on a target in the U.S. Highlighting the days leading up to the event, The Insurgents is more about the motivations of the people involved than the act itself.
