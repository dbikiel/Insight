Two best friends see their trip of a lifetime take a dark turn when one of them is struck by a mysterious affliction. Now, in a foreign land, they race to uncover the source before it consumes him completely.
Best friends Derek and Clif set out on a trip of lifetime. Their plan: travel to the ends of the earth, see the world, and live life to the fullest. But the trip soon takes a dark and bloody turn. Just days in, one of the men shows signs of a mysterious affliction which gradually takes over his entire body and being. Now, thousands of miles from home, in a foreign land, they must race to uncover the source before it consumes him completely. Footage meant to be travel memories may now become evidence of one of the most shocking discoveries ever captured on film...and perhaps will be their only postcard home.
The Canadians Derek Lee, who has an aneurysm and may die in any moment, and Clifton "Clif" Prowse are best friends and decide to quit their jobs to travel around the world. They arrive first in Barcelona, where they meet two other friends that are musicians and they together to Paris, where they have scheduled a concert. The shy Derek meets Audrey and they spend the night together. In the morning, his friends come to his room and find Derek bitten and covered in blood but they do not go to the hospital since Derek is afraid of interrupting his trip. When Clif and Derek arrives in Italy, Derek vomits the food; burns with the sunlight; and his strength has increased a lot. Soon they discover that Derek was infected by Audrey and now he is a vampire. Clif tries to help his friend, but how?
