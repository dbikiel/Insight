An enigmatic translator with a dark past is brought in for questioning after an ex-pat friend, who came between her and her photographer boyfriend, ends up missing and presumed dead.
In 1989 Tokyo, Lucy Fly, an enigmatic expat haunted by a painful past, enters into an intense relationship with Teiji, a handsome yet similarly troubled local photographer. Lucy's imperturbable exterior begins to crack when a naive newcomer, Lily Bridges, becomes entangled in their lives and ends up missing - suspected dead.
Lucy is a buttoned-up, MUJI-clad translator who has been in Japan for five years and is desperate to blend in. Her reticent nature hides old scars. There's also the fact that people around her keep dying - accidentally or otherwise. After a street encounter with hot photographer Teiji, she quickly finds herself under his spell, despite all the warning signs. And the pot is stirred further when American nurse Lily - all blowzy sexual confidence and cultural naivety - arrives in town and Lucy experiences some frightening impulses.
