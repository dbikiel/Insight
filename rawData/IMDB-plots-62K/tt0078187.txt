While attempting to win the affections of a beautiful rival, a master thief risks death to learn the secret intentions of a wealthy and seemingly immortal, but certainly ruthless, recluse.
In Transylvania, Lupin III, the notorious international thief, is hung and no one is more suprised to learn of that than Lupin III himself, who was alive and well and nowhere near that area at that time. The answer to that mystery, begins to surface when Lupin gets a seemingly ordinary pebble from an Egyptian pyramid for his would-be girlfriend, Fujiko, the mercenary thief, who is in the employ of a mysterious figure known only as Mamo. Intrigued by this bizarre request, Lupin decides to get involved and finds himself in an international chase that has a greater scope and danger than he has ever faced.
Reports have been made that Lupin was hanged in Transylvania, but Zenigata went to see for himself that Lupin was really alive. And he was right, as Lupin was more alive than before. But it's a complete mystery to him on why there was someone else who had the same DNA as him. So he, Jigen, and Goemon set off on a quest in retrieving the "Philosopher's Stone" from Egypt as it's said to be the key to immortality. While Fujiko is working with a mysterious figure name Mamo who wants that stone. As Lupin progresses his journey he'll be amazed and shocked on who this Mamo really is, as well as the guy who was executed instead of him.
