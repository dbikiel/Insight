While on a late night road trip home, a woman must save her rebellious teenage daughter who runs off with a bizarre group of blood-letting psychos.
Divorced business-bitch Senga Wilson grudgingly drives daughter Nathalie 'Nat' home after a visit to her dad, far away. During a rest-stop, Nat sneaks out with a friend and joins a weird truck-nomadic hippie-like sort of cult, which Senga tails. Its 'father' uses drugs and sex to bind everyone to his bloodthirsty scheme. When Bradford PD detective Ned Stephens investigates, Nat's dad assures him she's safe with him and Senga is pathologically disturbed. Nightmares blur who is imagining or lying what.
While driving back home with her spoiled and arrogant teenager daughter Natasha Wilson, the divorced and pills addicted Senga Wilson stops in a restaurant on the road for a coffee break. When they are leaving the place, Nat invites a mystic and mysterious hitchhiker to travel with them. Later, Nat meets her father Marek and has a serious discussion with her mother, and she runs away from her mother, joining a weird group. Along the night, Senga tries to find and recover her daughter.
