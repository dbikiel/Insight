Pope Francis travels the world speaking to those in need and delivering a message of hope.
"Pope Francis - A Man of His Word" is intended to be a personal journey with Pope Francis, rather than a biographical documentary about him. The pope's ideas and his message are central to this documentary, which sets out to present his work of reform and his answers to today's global questions.
