Compilation of four short films about homoerotic situations involving young men. Tom DeCerchio directed "Nunzio's Second Cousin", telling the story of a gay cop who forces a gay-basher to come to his house and have dinner with his family. In "Alkali, Iowa", by Mark Christopher, a young gay man finds out some of his father's past secrets. And "Must Be the Music", by Nickolas Perry, follows four teenagers looking for love in nightclubs.
In the wake of its successful predecessor, this quartet of films continues the topic of life as a gay male in America. "Must Be the Music" offers a frank depiction of urban gay youth; "Nunzio's Second Cousin" finds a gay cop getting even with some homophobes; "Alkali, Iowa" chronicles a homosexual, Midwestern teen who unearths his dead father's secret; and "The DadShuttle" centers on the communication breakdown between a father and his gay son.
