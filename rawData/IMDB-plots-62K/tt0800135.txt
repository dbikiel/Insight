A "Reformed Colonel" is found dead in Paris, a couple of decades after Algeria's struggle for independence was won from France. Lieutenant Galois is assigned the investigation of this murder. She receives the diary of Lieutenent Guy Rossi who served under The Colonel in Algeria in 1956, and has been reported as missing in action since 1957. The revelations found in Rossi's diary go far beyond The Colonel's actions in Algeria, and give an insight on how dirty Algeria's War for Independence really was.
When the extreme rightist retired with amnesty Colonel Raoul Duplan is deadly shot in his house, Detective Phillipe from the police department investigates the case. Lieutenant Galois is assigned by the high command of the army to follow the investigations of the murder and prepare reports with her findings. Without any lead, she receives some pages of the diary of Lieutenant Guy Rossi with a message telling that the colonel died in Saint Arnaud. Lieutenant Galois reads the pages and discovers that Rossi was a just-graduated lawyer with a broken heart because his girlfriend Isabelle left him that volunteered to the French army in 1955 and served under the command of the colonel in Algeria. Every day, the curious Galois receives a correspondence with the sequel of the diary disclosing details of the relationship of Rossi with the colonel until she discloses the identity and the motives of the killer.
