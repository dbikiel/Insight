A filmmaker (Adam Rifkin) follows an actor (Tony Markes) from obscurity through unsuccessful aspirations to stardom.
A film director (Adam Rifkin) decides to chart the course of a young actor (Tony Markes) as he tries to make it in Hollywood. Attempts to get him noticed and placed in roles meet with failure. A guest role on "Baywatch" ends when he steps on a stingray and has to be hospitalized. The filmmaker's frustration is multiplied by the fact that the original actor (David Andriole) he had selected and who had to drop out of the project because of a studio commitment, meets success and constantly crops up in roles where the second actor is struggling for his break.
