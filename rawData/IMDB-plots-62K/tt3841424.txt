In post-World War II Denmark, a group of young German POWs are forced to clear a beach of thousands of land mines under the watch of a Danish Sergeant who slowly learns to appreciate their plight.
In post-World War II Denmark, the Danish government puts their hated German prisoners of war to work clearing the 1.5 million landmines from the western beaches of the country. At one such beach, Sgt. Carl Leopold Rasmussen finds himself in charge of one such labor unit and finds they are largely all inexperienced boys. As the boys struggle to complete and survive their dangerous work, Sgt. Rasmussen's hate for Germans gradually cools as he grows to understand the horrific situation these child soldiers are in even as the mines claim more and more victims. Eventually, the boys and the Sergeant must decide what can be done in a situation that would be later be denounced by later generations as the worst war crime committed by the Danish government in its history.
May 1945 and the war in Europe has ended. German soldiers are put to work on the Danish coast, clearing mines buried on the beaches. It is a dangerous job and the Germans are young and inexperienced. One such unit is supervised by Sergeant Rasmussen, a veteran of the war and someone who hates the Germans and what they did to his country during the war. He takes his anger out on the young boys in his unit. However, over time his attitude changes.
