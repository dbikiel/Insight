Oswald the Rabbit gathers some of the greatest entertainers of the age to cure Old King Cole of the blues.
Oswald is at the dentist. A tooth being pulled hangs on tight. Just then, the radio reports "Old King Cole has the blues" and Oswald races off in his car. He gathers up a collection of comics: Charles Chaplin, Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy, etc. At the castle, they start singing off-kilter versions of Mother Goose rhymes, with Al Jolson in a blackface routine, and the king is quickly cheered up. Laurel &amp; Hardy haul in a large pile of pies, and an all-out fight breaks out. The jester, who has been getting jealous of Oswald, kidnaps him during the fight and hauls him into a dungeon, submitting him to various tortures, where we discover that the real torture has been the dentist pulling the tooth all along.
Oswald the Rabbit is at the dentist getting his sore tooth removed, but it won't go gentle into that good night. As the dentist attempts to pull it out, it sprouts hands and hangs on to another tooth for dear life. This dental drama is interrupted when a radio broadcaster announces that Old King Cole has the blues. Oswald leaps out of the dentist's chair and goes to the rescue. As the king's unfunny jester attempts to cheer up the melancholic monarch, Oswald brings to the throne some of the greatest entertainers of the age, including Paul Whiteman, Roscoe Ates, Joe E. Brown, Edna May Oliver, W.C. Fields, Al Jolson, 'Mae West' and many more. Laurel and Hardy start a pie fight to get the king laughing. The king himself gets hit with several pies, but that just makes it all more fun. Meanwhile, the jester seethes with jealousy and plots his revenge.
