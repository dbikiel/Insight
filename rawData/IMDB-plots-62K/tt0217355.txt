A non-glamorous portrayal of the lives of people who make their living at a strip club.
Angel is a dancer wishing to adopt a child. Stormy is a dancer with a secret with her brother Sully. Jasmine is a poetess who falls in love with Dennis. Jo is a dancer who became pregnant and Jessie is a woman fighting to survive in Hollywood. The link between them is the fact that they dance at Blue Iguana, a strip-club managed by Eddie. Their personal dramas are the theme of this movie.
An up-close and personal look, on stage and backstage, at five ecdysiasts who dance at the Blue Iguana in L.A. Stormy is melancholy and distant; a man from her past has come to town and wants to see her. Jasmine writes poetry and may have met someone - Dennis, who organizes readings at a coffee house. Angel, a ditzy stoner, wants a foster child; a Russian hitman is smitten by her. Jessie is new in town, a vulnerable adolescent who tries to act grown up. Jo is brassy, in-your-face, and pregnant. Eddie runs the place with help from Bobby. A big weekend is coming up, so he's hired Nico to headline. The women look for reassurance; some find it in each other.
