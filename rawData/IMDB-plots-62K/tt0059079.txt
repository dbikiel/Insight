A group of bandits kidnaps the governor's son and demands their imprisoned leader to be set free in exchange.
A ruthless band of thugs kidnaps a young official to exchange for their leader who has been captured. Golden Swallow is sent to take on the thugs and free the prisoner (who is also her brother). Though she is able to handle the overwhelming odds, she is hit by a poison dart and gets help from a beggar who is really a kung-fu master in disguise. With his help, she forms a plan to get her brother back.
A bandit clan ambushes a government garrison and captures the Official of the group. The reason behind their evil plan is to get back their Clan Chief, who was arrested not so long ago, by exchanging the Official for the Chief. Golden Swallow, an Official from the government, is sent by the Governor to save the Official. Disguised as a man, she will confront the bandits group but Jade Faced Tiger, their evil leader, is not that easy to deal with. Golden Swallow will then find a new ally in Drunken Cat. Together they will team up against the bandits and try to overcome the crisis.
