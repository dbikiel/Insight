An old flame of Mason's is one of those being considered to fill a vacated government position. Now, her husband's approached by a man who says he knows his wife's secret and that if this secret should ever get out, her appointment might not push through. So, he offers to sell the information he has to him. So, when he goes to him, he finds him dead, and he is arrested for the crime and placed on trial, and Perry's asked to defend him. And Perry also suspects that the dead was hired by one of his friend's friends to steal the evidence of her secret so that they could expose it and sabotage her appointment, and in all likelihood is the killer.
