Stranded on an island, a group of schoolboys degenerate into savagery.
After a plane crash in the ocean, a group of military students reach an island. Ralph organizes the boys, assigning responsibilities for each one. When the rebel Jack Merridew neglects the fire camp and they lose the chance to be seen by a helicopter, the group split under the leadership of Jack. While Ralph rationalizes the procedures, Jack returns to the primitivism, using the fear for the unknown (in a metaphor to the religion) to control the other boys, and hunting and chasing pigs, stealing the possession of Ralph's group and even killing people.
A plane carrying schoolboys from a military school crashes into the ocean. A group of them make it to an island. After taking stock of their surroundings they settle into a regimen and order, with Ralph as their leader. However, after a while a splinter group emerges, lead by Jack. Jack is hardly a benevolent leader and fascism and barbarism follow.
Adapted from William Golding's novel of the same name, this is the story of a group of military school boys who become stranded on an island. They are, however, not alone. To begin with their commander is dragged from the water by Ralph. It is after the commander becomes feverish and delusional that he runs away and the boys develop their own society, with frightening and powerful consequences.
