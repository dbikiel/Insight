The life story of Dutch painter Han van Meegeren, from his beginnings as a rebellious young artist in 1920s Amsterdam to his rise to infamy as one of the most ingenious art forgers of all time.
Young and talented Han van Meegeren is a rebel in the early 1920's Amsterdam art-scene. Because he paints in the style of his idols Rembrandt and Vermeer, critics find his work old-fashioned and they call him a copycat. Just to prove a point, he produces a fake Vermeer and tries to pass it off as a real one. It works. Instead of revealing the truth and thereby embarrassing the art world, he continues to make money off of his many forgeries. Soon he is caught in a web of lies and deceit, and his life spins out of control. Then one day, high ranking Nazi Hermann GÃ¶ring knocks on his door, looking for a Vermeer for his private collection...
Inspired by a true story. Talented artist Han van Meegeren is a rebel in the 1920's Dutch art scene. When he falls madly in love with Jolanka, the wife of Holland's most important art critic, he makes a powerful enemy who destroys his career. As revenge, he sets out to forge a perfect Vermeer to fool the art world and humiliate his enemy. When forced to choose between revealing the truth and getting revenge or keeping quite and winning Jolanka's heart, he chooses the latter.
