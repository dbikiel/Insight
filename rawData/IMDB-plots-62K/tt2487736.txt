A little girl receives a magic flower that grants seven wishes and starts wasting them one after another, not caring about the consequences.
Girl Zhenya gets a magic flower. Its seven petals are the seven desires that she can fulfill. Zhenya does not immediately understand what she got in her hands, and the first six of her desires are empty and meaningless. "Six petals spent and no pleasure," she states. Only with the last petal she makes a real good deed - helps the boy Vitya, curing him of lameness, after which they joyfully play touch and run game.
