A pair of crooks (von Stroheim and Lorre) use a phony countess (Zorina) who winds up falling in love with one of their victims (Greene).
Andre Desormeaux, master con artist and jewel thief, has been very successful with his partners, light-fingered Polo and beautiful lure "Countess" Tanya Vronsky. But Tanya falls in love with one of their victims, resigns from the team, and (despite Andre's warning) marries rich young Paul Vernay...for love. Inevitably, Andre and Polo reappear in her life. Can Tanya outwit the master schemer?
Countess (and dancer) Tanya Vronsky glides and dances her way through various European capitals, luring wealthy jewel connoisseurs in a trap, where her confederates proceed to fleece them. Her confederates are the suave and relentless Andre Desormeaux, who love Tanya madly; and the muddled-thinking but light-fingered Polo, who worships her. In Nice, they target wealthy Paul Vernay as her next victim. But she falls in love with him, refuses to share in the spoils and quits her partners in crime. She marries Paul and a few months later, while she is rehearsing a ballet number for a charity affair, Desormeaux and Polo show up and threaten to expose her if she doesn't participate in one more job with them.
