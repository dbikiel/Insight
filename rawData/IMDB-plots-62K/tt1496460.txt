Space Tourists succeeds in surprising its audience with images and situations that have very little to do with the futuristic fantasy of 'space-tourism'. The filmmaker sets up encounters with the least likely people imaginable: places even stranger and more unknown than outer space itself. With extra-ordinary access and truly first-time images the film investigates the emotional oscillations of an expensive enterprise and questions the meaning and boundaries of the human spirit and our hunger for adventure and discovery.
