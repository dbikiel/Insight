Egon Olsen's criminal trio always gets itself into unlucky, comical situations when executing Egon's genius plans. After release from prison, Egon already has a new plan - steal a valuable German item from a secured museum in Copenhagen.
The first of 13 Olsenbanden films presents us with Egon Olsen, head of the gang, and his friends Benny and Kjeld, who want to become the best known gang in Denmark and eventually Europe by stealing a famous Bavarian work of art currently displayed in a Copenhagen museum. Although Egon's plan works out fine, there is only trouble ahead for the little gang.
