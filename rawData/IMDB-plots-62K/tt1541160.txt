A man caught in the middle of two simultaneous robberies at the same bank desperately tries to protect the teller with whom he's secretly in love.
Tripp (Patrick Dempsey) walks into a bank to get some change and ends up as a hostage to two bank robber-teams, robbing the bank he is at. In an almost Sherlock Holmesian way he has to solve this Agatha Christie inspired mystery and win the girl's (Ashley Judd) heart. But not everything is at it seems, and there are many twists and turns in this comedy.
On a quiet Friday afternoon at a nearly empty bank near closing time, Tripp approaches the booth of the smart-looking teller, Kaitlin, to break down a $100 bill. However, what seems like the last transaction before the weekend, rapidly turns into a volatile situation, as not one, but two different sets of ambitious thieves simultaneously attempt to rob the bank, catching the few hostages in the dangerous crossfire. Now, an inept duo of smash-and-grab robbers competes with a highly trained gang of criminals for the organisation's treasures, unbeknownst to them that the stage is set for a delightfully devious game of entrapment. Undoubtedly, there is a sinister criminal mastermind behind this deadly fly trap. Can Tripp and Kaitlin outsmart him to solve the mystery of the double robbery?
