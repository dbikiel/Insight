Violet Jones tired of waiting for her longtime boyfriend to propose, breaks up with him. But old feelings, and heaps of jealousy, no doubt, arise when he promptly begins dating another woman.
Violet Jones (Lathan) doesn't realize it at first but she's dismayed by her superficial, "perfect" life. She has everything she thought she'd need - a successful career, friends and a boyfriend who is a handsome doctor (Whittle). When her fairy tale begins to unravel, so does she. This movie shows what a beautiful, smart, successful woman can do when she starts to look inward instead of outward!
