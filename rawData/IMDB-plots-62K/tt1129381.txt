Geraldine Ferraro Elementary is on the brink of collapse: the lowest test scores in the state, teachers who are either drunk or having sex on school grounds, and a principal who extorts money from parents. It's up to Tom, the down-on-his-luck vice-principal, to rally the lazy teachers, expose the principal's corruption, and turn the school around before an end of the day board decision that is certain to lead to its closure.
Geraldine Ferraro Elementary vice principal Tom Willoman, a life-long screwup without any self-confidence, feels his professional life is over when the school inspector, former schoolmate Rebecca Seabrook, warns her report will almost certainly mean the end of his school. However they agree to find out what the arrogant, suspiciously unconcerned principal Harper Billings is up. They discover his abusive practices towards pupils, de-motivated staff and blackmailed parents culminate in a real estate plot. Tom spearheads the counteroffensive.
