When prostitution becomes her life she also finds a magic lamp. Her wishes? Well let's just say mankind has no chance.
A young Romanian girl, bored with small-town life, dreams of entering the glamorous world she sees on Italian soap operas. One night at a club, she meets Gabriel, who claims to be a TV producer who wants to cast her in a reality TV show he is making in Italy. But when she arrives, she is sold to the pimp Manol and forced to make her living on the street. Things get darker with the arrival of Ettore, a sadist who makes snuff movies.
Sofia is a young Romanian girl who dreams to become a show girl. Sofia meets Gabriel, an Eastern European producer who has been living in Rome who asks her to follow him that very same night: he is about to film a new reality show and he thinks there might be a part for her in it. Sofia reaches the conclusion that she cannot lose the opportunity of a lifetime and she gets into Gabriel's car. As the dawn light filters through the sky, Gabriel has gone. Manor has taken his place; he organizes a bevy of extremely young girls from Eastern Europe. She is forced to work as a prostitute and she experiences violence and the steamy squalor of the punters' cars.
