Fresh out of medical school, young Dr. James Kildare decides to take a position at a large New York hospital instead of joining his father's country practice. In New York he meets the famous Dr. Leonard Gillespie who becomes his mentor. Kildare finds himself in serious trouble when he saves a suicidal woman who turns out to be an heiress with a powerful family.
After graduating from medical school, Dr. James Kildare returns home to a warm family welcome. His father, also a doctor, has taken it for granted that Jimmy will join him in his small town practice but he has already accepted a internship at Blair General Hospital in New York City. There he meets Dr. Leonard Gillespie, the crotchety senior physician who, from all outward appearances, takes a dislike to the eager young physician. Kildare works hard, going on ambulance calls where in one case, he rescues an attractive young woman who attempted suicide by gassing herself. She is Barbara Chanler, a wealthy heiress, with whom Kildare develops a rapport. He is convinced she is sane despite the diagnosis of the hospital's eminent psychiatrist. Kildaire's refusal to share any information she may have imparted to him in trust results in his being suspended. Gillespie thinks Kildare has the makings of a excellent diagnostician and becomes his mentor.
