In his ninth comedy special, Lewis Black tears into a country that is going nowhere at the speed of light. "Old Yeller" weaves the riotous tale of a country that is so strung out on ADD that it can't see straight. In his rabid attack, Mr. Black even turns on himself--and his entire generation. From cable television to the computer, from Facebook to Twitter, Mr. Black rages about the prison we've insanely created for ourselves. He snarls at the country's failure to find alternative energy sources while creating cell phones out of the realm of science fiction. He mauls our nation's leaders for their laughably inept handling of social security and health care--and failing to provide help on any level whatsoever. As Mr. Black puts it, "What are you going to do when the Democrats are dumb, the Republicans are stupid and the Tea Party doesn't even know what day it is?" He takes what makes us crazy and makes it funny. It's a night of live comedy you won't forget. . . but if you do, it's probably because you're taking a drug that lowers your cholesterol.
