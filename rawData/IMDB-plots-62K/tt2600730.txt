A Canadian aboriginal woman journeys to the Arctic in search of a missing member of her tribe, and falls in love with a man from a rival clan.
Maïna is the daughter of the Innu Chief Mishte-nape, who witnesses a bloody clash between their clan and the clan of "Men of the Land Without Trees." Following this unsolicited confrontation, Maïna chooses a mission that will change her life. To fulfill the promise that she made to her friend Matsii on her deathbed, she embarks on the trail of their enemies to rescue Nipki, her friend's 11-year old boy that the Inuit have captured. But she is also taken as a prisoner by Natak, the leader of the Inuit group, and forcibly taken to the Land Without Trees.
