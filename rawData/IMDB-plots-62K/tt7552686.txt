To get to Jo, Claire sends his best-friend Chris a friend request and he accepts. The pair begins to exchange messages and their fake friendship turns into a fake love affair. Claire is in love with Chris and he is in love with her fake profile. Now he wants to meet the 24-year-old beauty he's been chatting with. She invents a busy job, professional trips and even a jealous ex. The more and more in love they are the more the situation becomes unbearable.
