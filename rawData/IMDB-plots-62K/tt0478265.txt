There is a place... a place called Grockleton, wherein, high on a hill-top stands the lonely Beesley's Manor, governed by the villainous 'Landlord' and his lowly male counterparts (Pooch, Pike and the diesel-swilling Dobbin). Always on the look-out for new female company to help carry on the Beesley name, the Landlord keeps a watchful eye over Grockleton and anyone who dares to enter his land. When three improbable heroes stumble unsuspectingly into the Beesley's realm they are cruelly snared into a menacing hunt and an unstoppable frenzy of heart racing mayhem! Will the Landlord triumph and collect his 'trophies' (and maybe even a future bride?), or can the unlikely trio be victorious against him in his own game?
While driving his red truck through the countryside seeking adventure, Jon and his wife Susan realize that they are lost. They come across a couple of men on the road who give them directions and advise them to keep away from the "road of light". However, Jon decides to risk it and takes a lonely road, trying to find an inn to spend the night. They reach the Beesley's Manor in Grockleton, and they are welcomed by the weird Landlord that provides a room for the couple. Meanwhile, the friends Ric, Shaz, Heather and Marcus "Helmet" comes to Grockleton to hike in the woods. However, they are hunted by the locals and only the clumsy Marcus survives. When the Landlord discovers that Susan is pregnant, he decides to spare her life to perpetuate his family. But Jon escapes and together with Marcus, they plot a plan to rescue Susan from the bizarre and dysfunctional family.
