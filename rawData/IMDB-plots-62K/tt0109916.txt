Godzilla is threatened by two new forces: Mogera - another UN built machine; and Space Godzilla - a beast spawned from Godzilla's particles in space.
When Mothra went into outer space to stop a meteor from reaching Earth, she accidentally took with cells from Godzilla and remaining cells from Biollante that inhabited our atmosphere. The combined cells went through a black hole and created a new creature, Space Godzilla. Space Godzilla heads to Earth to confront Godzilla, Junior Godzilla, and the new G-Force robot, MOGERA.
When a space alien spawning from the same cells as Godzilla, attacks earth in seek of world domination. Godzilla, with the help of a UN built Robot named MOGURA, seeks out to kill the alien with a personal vendetta after it captures Godzilla's infant son.
