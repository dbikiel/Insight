A geek takes Tara to the prom but ends up in the wrong side of LA. He wakes up in a dark alley and slowly remembers what happened to them. He "sold" Tara to a pimp. A night to remember.
Winston Connelly wakes up in the middle of the night in an alley with no idea of how he got there. Nor does he know where in Los Angeles he is or why he is wearing a beat-up tuxedo. Through a series of flashbacks, he remembers that he was sidetracked on his way to the prom the night before. In the meantime, he has to figure out what happened to his wallet, his car keys, his date, and why a pimp named "Tito" wants him dead.
