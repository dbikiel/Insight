A teacher with paranormal abilities helps a group of ghosts graduate high school.
"The Sixth Sense" meets "The Breakfast Club" when a teacher who sees dead people applies for work at a high school haunted by five student poltergeists who died during detention. All his life Modesto has seen dead people walking around like living people and has long accepted the assessment of others that he has a mental problem. Principal Tina Escalonilla turns that around when Modesto describes a detail (known to her) about the school spirits that no others have been able to reveal. With her school poised to be closed due to unrelenting paranormal high jinx, she begs Modesto to stay and see what he can do to ease these spirits into the next life before Founder's Day.
