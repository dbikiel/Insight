Censored by the Polish authorities, this movie was re-edited and new footage added. It begins with a science fiction motif: abstract images and electronic music take the viewer from ruins of Lebanon to the set of Voelker Schloendorf "The Forgery", where Skolimowski plays a lead role. Another shift takes us to London, where Skolimowski shoots a street scene. There are also shifts into the past with the old footage, featuring a score of Polish actors and actresses in a setting resembling Kantor's experimental theatre.
