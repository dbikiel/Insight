Poppy Summerall is hired near Halloween as a temporary nanny by Ryan Lawson, a widowed, work-obsessed executive. Through a series of adventures, the eternally optimistic Poppy sets out to teach Ryan and his two young children what's important in life - unconditional love, family and the joy of everyday occurrences.
Poppy finds it hard to commit to a man or a job. Her sister points out how good she is with kids, so she's hired as a nanny by a workaholic widower with two kids and teaches them how powerful and joyful love and everyday occurrences can be.
