After falling by a cliff on a desert beach, a seriously injured surfer starts a lonely fight to survive against the merciless nature.
Based on real events. On September 6, 2014, Álvaro Vizcaíno Albertos, a surfer who wakes up in his jeep in Fuerteventura Island (one of the Canary Islands) after being too drunk the last night, and after a fight with the companion of his part-time girlfriend Ona, in addition to learning that his close friend Nelo is going to leave him to travel to Canada to create a family with his recent and pregnant girlfriend. Alone in this remote corner of Fuerteventura and dominated by pride, anger and jealousy, Álvaro decides take his surf table looking for the perfect wave, but while he walks by the coastal dunes close to the jeep, he suddenly stumbles and slides down the dune to a reef, where he keeps in a delicate position in the border trying to avoid crashing against the rocks. Calculating the natural cycle of the waves, Álvaro throws himself to the void, falling into the water but injuring seriously in the head and breaking his left hip in the fall. Unable to stand up and walk, without food, drink and all kind of help, Álvaro is taken by the tide until the beach, where he finds himself in a state of total loneliness and desolation, having hallucinations with Ona to check the life he lived until the accident and the way he behaved with friends and familiars. Trapped in an extreme fight to survive, Álvaro faces not only his own death, but the determination to live and be rescued before it's too late.
