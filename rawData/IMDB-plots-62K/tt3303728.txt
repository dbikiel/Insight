A fishing-boat crew takes on a dangerous commission to smuggle a group of illegal immigrants from China to Korea.
The captain of a South Korean fishing trawler is offered his biggest payday yet. All he has to do is pick up a bunch of Chinese refugees off the mainland of China and bring them to South Korea. He takes the job and initially everything goes well. However, the plans are thrown into disarray when tragedy strikes.
