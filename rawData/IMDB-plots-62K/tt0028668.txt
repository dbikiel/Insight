Captain Drummond becomes a prisoner when he intents to protect a beautiful heiress of an espionage organization.
Captain Hugh 'Bulldog' Drummond has just returned to England. As he is driving home in the dark, a young woman jumps out in front of his car. He misses her, but she falls to the ground. As he tries to revive her, he hears a shout for help, then gunshots. As he goes to investigate, the woman drives away with Drummond's car. He is soon able to trace her to nearby Greystone Manor, and when he goes there to meet her, she slips him a note urging him to help her get out of a desperate situation.
