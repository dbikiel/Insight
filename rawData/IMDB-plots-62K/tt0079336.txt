On the eve of their children's marriage, NYC in-laws Sheldon Kornpett and Vince Ricardo embark on a series of misadventures involving the CIA, the Treasury Department and Central American dictators.
In preparation for his daughter's wedding, dentist Sheldon Kornpett meets Vince Ricardo, the groom's father. Vince, a manic fellow who claims to be a government agent, then proceeds to drag Sheldon into a series of chases and misadventures from New York to Central America.
A mild mannered dentist is about to marry off his daughter but he's never met the boy's father. When the father of the groom comes to dinner, he brings with him weird behavior and an international plot that involves stolen plates for U.S. Currency. This is bad enough, but it occurs to him that no one would be suspicious of a dentist and he begins to ask for a few favors that have people trying to kill our hero.
