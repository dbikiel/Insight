A dowdy university instructor Isa is an inattentive husband to his younger, TV-business wife Bahar. Self-absorbed and selfish, Isa only communicates in the most rudimentary way, while she, similarly, detaches into crying jags and juvenile behavior.
In Turkey, the middle-age University Professor Isa and his younger wife Bahar, who works in television, are spending summer vacation in Kas. After a couple of days, Isa decides to separate from Bahar since they do not communicate with each other. Bahar returns to Istanbul alone and then she travels to the countryside to work in a new project. Meanwhile Isa meets his former lover Serap with his friend Guven and later he rapes her in her house. Then he travels to meet Bahar and propose her to move in together again. What will be her decision?
