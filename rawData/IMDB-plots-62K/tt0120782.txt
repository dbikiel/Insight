A recently released ex-con gets involved in a fake kidnapping scheme that turns very real.
After being released from prison on a bum charge, Harry Barber is out for some payback to regain the two years he has lost. He is hired by Mrs. Malroux to fake the kidnapping of her stepdaughter (the daughter of a dying millionaire). He discovers that he is being set up on multiple levels and will soon face a longer prison sentence if he does not prove the truth to the police.
Harry Barber just can't catch a break. First, his refusal to take hush money and keep quiet after he discovers city hall corruption unjustly lands him in jail. He realizes that being a good guy doesn't pay. Later, when a golden opportunity presents itself, he decides to grab himself some payback. He's offered $50,000 to place a phone call, as part of a fake-kidnapping scam.
