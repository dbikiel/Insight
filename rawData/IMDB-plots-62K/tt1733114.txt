With graduation looming, 4 friends get together for one last weekend. But a lot has changed since they were freshman roommates and the secrets are about to come out. This will be no ordinary girls' weekend. And when the boys show up, it only throws fuel on the fire. CHEESECAKE CASSEROLE is about the friendships that make us crazy, and the lengths you'll go to never leave them behind. It's about the people who know you when you've become a stranger to yourself, and the strength they give us to change our lives.
