Linda is still tormented by giving up a baby for adoption at 15. She wants a baby, but her husband has enough in his model trains, mistress and being a doctor.
A doctor's wife tires of his obsession with model trains, and spends her days wondering about the son she gave up for adoption at birth. While eating at a roadside caf√©, she encounters a British hitchhiker, who turns out to be her son. They spend time together trying to find a bond. The son begins to hate the husband, and the wife begins worrying about the safety of her husband and his train set.
For this psychological drama, Dennis Potter reworked his 1974 TV play, Schmoedipus, transposing the setting from London to the United States. The title "Track 29" is taken from the lyrics of "Chattanooga Choo Choo." Distraught and dreamy Linda Henry complains to her husband, surgeon Henry Henry, about their sex-less, childless marriage, but he's obsessed with his basement model railroad layout and also engaged in an affair with a nurse. When mysterious stranger Martin drops in on Linda, he claims to be her long-lost illegitimate son. As seen in flashbacks, the 16-year-old Linda was raped at a carnival by a man who resembles Martin. Subsequent events hint at Martin as a delusion, a product erupting from Linda's fantasy world.
