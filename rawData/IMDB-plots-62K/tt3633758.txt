Our protagonists are waiting for a show to come on. It would have been no trouble if an annoying clock had not decided to chime in.
Eventually everyone runs out of time - but before that happens to you, make some time to go on a journey, a journey through directorial duo Becky Sloan and Joseph Pelling's existentialist universe of temporal confusion, TV guides and bathtime. A sequel to Becky &amp; Joe's original mind-bending viral hit "Don't Hug Me I'm Scared", which has amassed over 13 million views on YouTube to date and inspired a wave of related videos, Don't Hug Me I'm Scared II" is an unsettling lesson in the dangers of time and the perils of metaphysical introspection.
The puppets, Harry, Robin and Manny are watching TV waiting for their show to start but when a clock comes out to sing a song about the time then when they get there to what they know about time they get more obsessed and the clock makes the puppets go completely wrong.
