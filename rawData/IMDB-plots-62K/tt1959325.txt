In this breathtaking science fiction spectacle, a strange mechanical device lands on a desolate world and uses the planet to undergo a startling transformation, that has profound implications for an entire galaxy.
At a far-off, barren and lifeless star, somewhere in the deep and cold space, an oblong self-contained metal pod begins the landing procedure, on a mission to bring a vital and radical change. Suddenly, from the inside, four terraforming machines scatter to the four corners of the planet in search of its natural resources, and after a while, they return to unite with the vessel. Now, everything is ready for the land's astounding transformation.
