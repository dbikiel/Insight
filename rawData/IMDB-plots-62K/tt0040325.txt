Matt Denant, ex-RAF flier, sentenced to three years in Dartmoor for striking and accidentally killing a detective who was attempting to arrest a lady of the evening to whom Denant had been casually speaking.Rankling under the injustice, Denant flees prision and manages to dodge the police with the aid of a beautiful shire lass with whom he has fallen in love and whose ideas, like those of the freedom-loving Denant, are slightly unconventional. However, hounded by both an indomitable constabulary and a conventional citizenry, Denant, who has sought sanctuary in a village church, finally gives himself up in order to save its parson from lying.
