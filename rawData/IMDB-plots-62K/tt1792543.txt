4 half siblings inherit $3,000,000 each from their dad if they work together as family for 2 years. 3 of them go to Mexico as bounty hunters to get a bail-jumper, who's connected to the billionaire kidnapping.
Sam and Leo Cleary have grown up hating each other, and neither likes their juvenile delinquent kid brother, Douglas, to whom they've only recently been introduced. The sons share the same father, a womanizing drunk, but all have different mothers. Their father died a rich man and when they're brought together by their sister Nina to learn which of them will inherit the old man's fortune, they are handed an unpleasant surprise. A requirement of the will is that the three estranged siblings go into business together as bail bondsmen. Their first job is to bring in a parole violator who has left Leo with a $250,000 debt. Their search will take them into the mountains of Mexico where they encounter a drug lord and uncover a kidnapping plot, masterminded by an embittered entrepreneur that will endanger them all.
After the death of her father, a daughter fulfills his last wish and finds a way to bring her three brothers back together... Sam (John Cena), a hardened cop currently on suspension, Leo, a loud-mouthed overbearing bail bondsman, and Douglas, a handsome twenty-year old thief fresh out of prison, who until recently never knew he even had a real family. When Leo discovers the con he pledged a lot of money for is suspected of kidnapping one of the wealthiest men in the country, he somehow convinces his two brothers to help him track the delinquent down so he doesn't lose his high-priced bond. After following the con all the way into Mexico, action quickly develops as the three brothers find themselves in the middle of a dangerous yet exhilarating adventure in the hopes of saving a missing man, and at the same time, rejuvenating a brotherly bond.
