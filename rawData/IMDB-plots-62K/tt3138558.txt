An anesthesiologist must awaken her animal instincts when she, her husband and her brother-in-law become the quarry of unseen hunters who want to turn them all into trophies.
Three family members head deep into the woods for a hunting trip that doubles as a distraction from their troubles at home. When all of their gear is stolen, they turn on each other, but soon realize there are much more treacherous forces at work.
PRESERVATION is a relentless psychological thriller set in the decaying sprawl of rural America. A camping trip for newlyweds Mike and Wit takes an unexpected turn when they are joined by Mike's brother, Sean, a former marine. When their tent is stolen overnight and they are left without food or water, the brothers turn on each other. A random act of violence becomes a game of cat and mouse. A weekend in the woods becomes survival of the fittest. A young couple must survive their failing marriage. An Iraq veteran must survive his violent past. And Wit must outsmart the predators hunting their prey. Christopher Denham's second feature film is an unexpected and unflinching exploration of violence in the digital age.
