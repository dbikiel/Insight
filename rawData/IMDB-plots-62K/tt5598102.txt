Director Agnes Varda and photographer/muralist J.R. journey through rural France and form an unlikely friendship.
Agnes Varda, one of the leading lights of France's honored French New Wave cinema era, and professional photographer and muralist, J.R., partake on a special art project. Together, they travel around France in a special box truck equipped as a portable photo booth and traveling printing facility as they take photographs of people around the country. With that inspiration, they also create special colossal mural pictures of individuals, communities and places they want to honor and celebrate. Along the way, the old cinematic veteran and the young artistic idealist enjoy an odd friendship as they chat and explore their views on the world as only they can.
Prolific director and pioneer filmmaker of the French New Wave, Agn√®s Varda, teams up with a renegade travelling companion, the imaginative and rather cryptic street photographer, muralist and installation artist, J.R., on a whimsical tour across the French countryside. The idea behind this artistic road trip of discovery is quite simple. The duo visits isolated villages, vast farms and small communities with an unquenched thirst to meet people and their amazing stories, which become part of an ever-growing mosaic of memories through massive, black-and-white posters plastered to walls. The result of this unexpected collaboration is surprising. But isn't that the whole point of art?
