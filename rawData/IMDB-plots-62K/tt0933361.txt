The sea, August, interesting and simple people. They tan, swim, play volleyball, basketball, drink, dance and then find someone to spend the night with. Many grew out of their student phase and can afford a more comfortable holiday but when July comes they grab a tent, jump into their cars and come here. Here, nobody talks about work and the size of your wallet means nothing. The focus shifts from one main character, to another, to a third and then back to the first with the ending being about the fourth who was the main hero in the previous episode. The story unfolds like a musical, where the rhythm is the method of storytelling.
