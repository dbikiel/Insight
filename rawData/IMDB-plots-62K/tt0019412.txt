Harold "Speedy" Swift, a fan of Babe Ruth and the New York Yankees, saves from extinction the city's last horse-drawn trolley, operated by his girlfriend's grandfather.
"Speedy" loses his job as a soda-jerk, then spends the day with his girl at Coney Island. He then becomes a cab driver and delivers Babe Ruth to Yankee Stadium, where he stays to see the game. When the railroad tries to run the last horse-drawn trolley (operated by his girl's grandfather) out of business, "Speedy" organizes the neighborhood oldtimers to thwart their scheme.
Harold Swift, nicknamed Speedy, loves the New York Yankees more than anything. His preoccupation with baseball and the Yankees has prevented him from being able to focus on and thus keep the various jobs that he's had, such as as a soda jerk and cab driver. The one other thing he may love just as much is his girlfriend, Jane Dillon. After an adventurous trip to Coney Island together, Speedy realizes that he wants to marry Jane, which means needing to get and keep a job. But before she can get married, she wants to ensure that the affairs of her grandfather, Pop Dillon, are finalized. He owns and operates the last horse drawn streetcar in New York City, in what is perhaps the most idyllic section of town. Most of the big streetcar companies want to buy Pop out for a song, but when Speedy learns that there is a planned merger of all streetcar services in New York City which cannot go ahead until all the smaller franchisees, such as Pop, are bought out, Speedy encourages Pop to hold out for a lucrative deal. As such, the large streetcar owners work nefariously behind the scenes to ruin Pop's business. Speedy, with the help of Pop's equally aged friends and a stray dog that followed Speedy home from Coney Island, do whatever they can to make sure Pop has what is truly coming to him, which may not happen if they can't stop the wrong-doings of those big streetcar companies.
