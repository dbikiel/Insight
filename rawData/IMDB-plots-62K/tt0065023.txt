In prehistoric times, a volcano erupts, resulting in loss a whole island under ash and lava. Survivors trying to convince a race (clan) to withdrawal, but something unexpected change their plans.
A devastating volcanic eruption on a remote island forces the remaining islanders to flee from their village to seek refuge in the rugged mainland, far away from the seismic epicentre. Exhausted and marooned in a strange and unknown place--deprived of food, water, and shelter--the small group of survivors must quickly seek nourishment and a new location to call home once again. However, their search will inevitably bring them up against the indigenous mainlanders, who are not quite willing to abandon their homes and their usual way of living for a new beginning with the newcomers. Little by little, the conflict that is silently brewing will disrupt the fine balance of things, leading to a climactic confrontation with unknown results. Will things ever be the same again?
