Four humble and goofy employees of a prominent circus, all of them with a natural comedic talent, rebel against their tyrannical boss and his unscrupulous illusionist assistant.
Humble employees, the friends Didi, Dedé, Mussum and Zacarias become the main attraction of the circus Bartholo thanks to the capacity that they possess of doing the public to laugh. Therefore, they face the magician's Assis Satã opposition and Barão's greed, owner of the circus. Didi likes Karina (Lucinha Lins), but she prefers to be with Frank.
