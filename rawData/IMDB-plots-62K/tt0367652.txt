Deuce is tricked again into man-whoring by T.J., only in Amsterdam while other man-whores are being murdered in his midst.
Deuce Bigalow ('Rob Schneider') goes to Amsterdam after a little accident including two irritating kids and a bunch of aggressive dolphins. There he meets up with his old friend TJ Hicks ('Eddie Griffin'). But a mysterious killer starts killing some of Amsterdams finest gigolos and TJ is mistaken for the extremely gay murderer. Deuce must enter the gigolo industry again to find the real murderer and clear TJs name.
After an accident with dolphins and elders on a beach, the clumsy fish tank cleaner and former gigolo Deuce Bigalow (Rob Schneider) is invited by his pimp friend T.J. Hicks (Edie Griffin) to travel to Amsterdam where he is presently living. Once there, T.J. Hicks is wrongly taken as a whore-men serial killer. Bigalow joins the gigolo's association trying to find the true identity of the murderer and clean TJ Hicks. Meanwhile, he meets the gorgeous Eva (Hanna Verboom), and while dating her, he suspects that she may be the wanted killer.
