Can it be justified to shoot down a civilian plane, converted by terrorists into a deadly suicide missile? Can "human arithmetic" be a legal calculus?
Islamic terrorists hijack an airplane with 164 passengers, planing to steer it into a football arena filled with 70 000 people. Major Lars Koch decides against the orders of his superiors and the laws of his country to shoot the airplane which leads to the death of all passengers. Now he is charged for murdering 164 people and the audience takes the role of the jury, deciding the difficult legal and moral question whether it can be considered a crime to kill reletively less innocent but moribund people in order to save tens of thousands.
German Luftwaffe (air force) Major Lars Koch stands trial for shooting down, against explicit orders, a passenger plane -killing all 164 aboard- in order to prevent the Jihadi terrorist hijackers carrying out their threat to make it crash on a football stadium with 70.000 potential casualties. State attorney Nelson first challenges the lack of alternative, almost shifting the charge to Koch's superior, Lauterbach, and questions if the passengers might still have overtaken the fiends. Then she and the defense, both attorney Herr Biegler and the major himself, bicker over morality, political positions and legal rulings, arguing whether the absolute value of human life under he German constitution prevents it being weighed against many lives and in how far the rule of law is absolute.
