In Chicago, an unemployed actor aims to solve the mystery concerning a string of ax murders, apparently committed by a lunatic.
The City of Chicago is gripped by an Axe Murderer. The streets are empty at night as there have been six murders and six people have been caught, but they are lunatics. Only one person has lived to tell about it and that was Edwina, who is as dumb as a brick. If it were not for Oliver, she would be number seven. When there is a second attempt on Edwina, Oliver figures that the crimes are not random and that someone is hypnotizing these people to do his bidding, but the police and Edwina are skeptical.
Six people have been murdered with axes in Chicago and, in each case, the killer has been caught and found to be a raving lunatic. Oliver Duffy, an unemployed actor, sees a sinister figure following Edwina Brown and he escorts her safely home. Keeping a watch over her, he catches the sinister man who also turns out to be a lunatic carrying an axe. Duffy concludes that a master-mind is behind the killings, and when a newspaper offers a $25,000 reward, Duffy resolves to win it. High on the lists of his suspects is a stage musician Edwina once knew in Paris.
