As Po looks for his lost action figures, the story of how the panda inadvertently helped create the Furious Five is told.
Master Oogway always said there are no accidents, but fate still takes unusual directions when Po is around. This is especially true in his youth when he is looking for his calling even as the great menace named Boar is on the rampage. After Po inadvertently sickens Master Shifu, the young and unsure Tigress is charged with finding four warriors to help her fight Boar, only to confuse Po's wishlist for his calling for her own list. In doing so, Tigress sets on a journey that would hardly be what Shifu intended. However, her quest leads to her future best friends who would become more than that they dreamed they could be even as they help Tigress find her own path that would help a certain giant panda as well.
Tigress, Viper, Monkey, Crane and Mantis transform from complete strangers into the legendary Furious Five Warriors of Kung Fu.
