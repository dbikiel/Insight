The first animated movie in the Soviet Union. A bloated caricature of a Capitalist devouring a massive heap of food and drink.
A bloated caricature of a capitalist devouring a massive heap of food and drink. He gets so stuffed he falls to the ground. Later he demands the company of women. They dance for him and gets swallowed. A worker appears. The old and the new church does too. A farmer appears. The worker and the farmer opens the capitalist for money. Plenty pour out of him. And the People First Bank is founded. A soldier appears. Than more soldiers...
The animated film depicts a gnawing and morally decaying bourgeois, whose belly, stuffed with an infinite amount of money, is ripped apart by a "centaur" consisting of a peasant and a worker. The film ends with a remarkable finale: a Red Armyman appears, and all the proletarians formed the "New Year tree" on which the enemies of Soviet society hung in the form of toys - the figures of "class alien elements" - the priest, the bourgeois Nepman, etc.
