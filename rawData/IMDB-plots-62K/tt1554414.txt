Reeling from her husband's affair, Rose collides with a marooned teenager in a boarded-up Delaware beach town.
Livid over her husband's affair, Rose drives from Virginia to Delaware to confront (if not kill) the woman who dallied with her man. While unable to immediately confront the woman, Rose finds a British lad who's somewhat stranded after coming to America, having pursued a pretty girl he once met but finding her now with another. Both emotionally adrift, Rose and the boy end up with each other for company at her parent's beach home, even roll-playing while Rose awaits the chance to confront her elusive romantic rival.
