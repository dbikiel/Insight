Schoolgirl Inga goes to visit her sister in Stockholm and is shocked to find her living with her boyfriend, Casten. She succumbs to Casten's charms, and after having broken up her sister's love affair, returns home to her parents.
Maid in Sweden tells the story of Inga, a 16-year-old Swedish girl who leaves her rural home to spend a weekend with her emancipated libertine sister, Greta in the Swedish capital. The visit starts out innocently enough, but soon Inga's beauty, and her tendency to disrobe at the drop of a hat, has her involved in a number of compromising situations. Greta's douche canoe boyfriend Carsten first opines that Inga is too much of a goodie two-shoes and lines her up with the abominable delinquent-in-waiting Björn. After a tedious date montage the contemptible Björn, true to form as an acquaintance of the equally rephrensible Carsten, attempts to rape an oblivious Inga. Later, seeking trust and solace in a relative, Inga is raped a second time by her own sister in the prequisite bout of sapphic seduction. She has a series of romantic adventures as she throws off the frustrations of her small-town environment.
