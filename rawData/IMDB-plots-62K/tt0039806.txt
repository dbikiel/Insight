On America's frontier, a St. Louis woman marries a New Mexico cattleman who is seen as a tyrant by the locals.
This western begins with St. Louis resident Lutie Cameron (Katharine Hepburn) marrying New Mexico cattleman Col. James B. 'Jim' Brewton (Spencer Tracy) after a short courtship. When she arrives in "Salt Fork, NM" she finds that her new husband is considered by the locals to be a tyrant who uses force to keep homesteaders off the government owned land he uses for grazing his cattle--the so-called Sea of Grass. Lutie, has difficulty reconciling her husband's beliefs and passions with her own.
Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy star as a husband and wife on America's frontier; cattlemen in a "sea of grass". The wife has an affair which produces a child, and she is ostracized from the community. Meanwhile, the farmers watch helplessly as the sea of grass is exploited until it becomes a dust bowl.
Brewton's cattle empire includes a million acres of grazing land. Lutie marries him and they have a daughter Sara Beth. Lutie goes alone to Denver where she and lawyer Chamberlain conceive a son Brock whom Jim later accepts with resignation. Long afterward Brock is killed by a posse and Sara Beth brings Lutie and Jim together once more.
