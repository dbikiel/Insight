Beautiful young girls are kidnapped off the streets of Manila by a death cult that needs their blood to remain immortal.
Women are being kidnapped off the streets of Manila and taken to a cave where they are forced to take part in a ritual to some god who provides them with eternal life if they drink some spiked human blood during the ceremony. Laura [Jennifer Billingsley], the chosen one, refuses. Much of the film is spent watching Laura and her fellow captives try to escape, accompanied by the high priest Baru [John Considine], who has suddenly seen the light, thanks to Laura's preachings.
