While oil drilling, Hoppy and California discover an underground well - a potential threat to Jebb Hardin's monopoly on water in the region.
Hoppy and his pals use their reward money to buy a half interest in the Whitlock ranch. After Wildcat Kelly cons California into buying a well drilling rig, they strike water instead of oil. This threatens Jebb Hardin's water monopoly and he retaliates by framing Hoppy for cattle rustling.
