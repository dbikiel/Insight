The sword-wielding warrior, Amethea, embarks on a life-or-death mission to liberate her sister from the clutches of an evil monarch. However, only torture and death await her. Can a man alone break the will of the valiant Barbarian Queen?
Set during the days of the Roman Empire. A simple village is raided by Roman troops, and most of the people are whisked off to be slaves or killed. Three women survive and set off to liberate their people. When they arrive at the Roman city, they team up with the local underground to seek vengeance and liberation of the slaves.
On the day of her wedding--refusing to take the destruction of her peaceful village lying down--Amethea, the sword-wielding warrior queen, embarks on a life-or-death mission to liberate her sister, Taramis, and the rest of the survivors from the clutches of the evil monarch, Lord Arrakur. Along with her loyal companion, Estrild, and the powerful fighter, Tiniara, the trio of barbarian defenders infiltrate the impenetrable castle hell-bent on revenge; however, there, imprisonment, torture, and death await them. Can the dauntless she-warriors organise a rebellion with the aid of the local underground resistance team? Is there a man who can break the will of the valiant Barbarian Queen?
