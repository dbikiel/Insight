The schemes of a ruthlessly ambitious British politician who will stop at nothing to get to the top.
Francis Urquhart is the Chief Whip of the Conservative Party. When Margaret Thatcher resigns as leader, he remains neutral and, after a general election in which the Conservatives are returned with a reduced majority, he fully expects the new Prime Minister, Henry Collingridge, to give him his just reward: a senior Cabinet post. When he's informed that he is to stay in his current position, he devises a plot to unseat Collingridge and ensure his own election as party leader which would make him Prime Minister.
Francis Urquhart is a senior member of the British Government. He expects a promotion when the new Prime Minister, Henry Collingridge, takes office and is bitterly disappointed when this does not take place. He sets in motion a plan to usurp Collingridge and become Prime Minister. Part of his plan involves manipulating a junior political reporter, Mattie Storin, in order to gain more favourable press coverage than Collingridge. This works well initially but then Storin starts digging into recent political events.
Francis Urquhart, Chief Whip, manipulates things and people to achieve his ambitions in the Houses of Parliament, all the while keeping his hand carefully hidden behind the scenes. But Mattie Storin, a young reporter, may be getting too close to him.
The Chief Whip (Francis Urquhart) is urged by his wife to become Prime Minister.
Francis Urquhart is a psychopath. He uses any method to remove any impediment to his goal: including blackmail, seduction (Mattie Storin) and murder. Having defeated all of his enemies, and some friends, he ties up loose ends by throwing his young mistress, Mattie, off the roof of the House of Commons. He then travels to Buckingham Palace, where the Queen will invite him to become her Prime Minister.
