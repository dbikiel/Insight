A group of tough city kids have 'graduated' from reform school and are assigned to a "Boy's Town" type of inmate self-government city shelter. The shelter is run by Hiram Krispan (Grant Mitchell), a crooked superintendent, assisted by Buck Caesar (Stanley Fields), an ex-racketeer on probation. Buck enjoys trying to straighten out the kids and joins with them and social workers Beth Avery (Margaret Lindsay) and Jim Donahue (Ronald Reagan), in getting Krispan removed from his job.
A paroled convict's efforts to improve conditions at a boys' reform school alarm the school's corrupt warden, who has been embezzling funds from the institution. He hatches a plan to derail the reformed convict's efforts and have him sent back to prison, and part of that scheme involves cracking down hard on the reform school's inmates.
