Donald hears a radio philosopher advise to laugh and count ten when he gets angry. He tries it successfully, then settles into his hammock for a nap. Between a caterpillar and the hen chasing it, he's soon tangled up and counting ten again. He also shrugs off a bird using his lemonade as a birdbath, but when a woodpecker attacks his apple tree, burying Donald in apples, he snaps.
