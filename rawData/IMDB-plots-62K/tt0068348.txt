The story of a disciplined and sexually driven man who keeps his family isolated in his home for years to protect them from the "evil nature" of human beings while inventing (with his wife) rat poison.
This film is based on a true story, in the 50´s in Mexico City and based in a book by Luis Spota "La carcajada del gato" (The laughter of the cat). It was also a theater play with the name "Los motivos del lobo" (The wolf´s motives) written by Sergio Magaña.
Gabriel Lima (Claudio Brook) kept his family, wife and three children, locked for 18 years in their downtown house, protecting them from a corrupt world. The children names were Utopia, Porvenir (future) and Voluntad (willpower). They worked producing rat poison, and only the father left sometimes the house, to sell the poison and bring food, clothes, etc. Everything happened there, work, study, play, haircuts, and even he had "jails" to punish unaccepted behaviors.
