A hip guardian angel named Bobby Fantana, who died in a car race in the 60s, reluctantly agrees to watch over lonely 80s high schooler Lenny Barnes who needs guidance on how to become cool.
When Bobby dies in a car accident he is not allowed to enter heaven but has to stay in one of the lower levels until he has worked enough as an guardian angel in order to deserve paradise. He is first given an assignment of helping a young kid named Lenny, who later Bobby founds out is his son. Lenny has a crush for a girl named Sharon who is the most beautiful girl of the class. But she does not even notice him until Bobby helps Lenny change his image and boosts his confidence. By doing this Bobby dresses Lenny up making him a playboy and tough guy so that he gets what he wants although Bobby knows that this is not the best. Bobby later realizes that Lenny's mother is his former girlfriend who has married another guy. Although not being allowed he makes himself visible to her... after some situations take place he vows to give his soul up to help his son from losing his own life. This unknowingly earns Bobby a trip to Heaven or "uptown" as the movie refers to it.
After revealing himself to his former girlfriend, he learns that Lenny is actually his son that his girlfriend was pregnant with when he died. Expecting to be sent to hell for breaking the rules he then learns he gets into heaven for his selfless act.
