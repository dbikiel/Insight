Lighthearted Comedy/drama, based on a day for 4 middle class couples ranging from late teens to middle aged, all of course have sex in their minds but their day brings unexpected and sometimes hilarious consequences. Great Soundtrack by Mar De Copas, Dolores Delirio, Cementerio Club,Los Fuckin Sombreros,Chabelo, Hermanos Brothers,El Ghetto,El Hombre Misterioso,Indigo,Pua Silencio, all excellent local bands.
