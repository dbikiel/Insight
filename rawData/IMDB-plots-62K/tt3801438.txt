Grumpy Cat is an Internet meme sensation with over 6 million Facebook friends, who has graced the cover of New York Magazine, is the spokescat for Friskies, appeared on American Idol and the MTV Movie Awards.
Grumpy Cat is a lonely cat living in a mall pet shop. Because she never gets chosen by customers, she develops a sour outlook on life...until one day during the holidays, a very special 12-year-old girl named Chyrstal enters the pet store. She falls in love with her after realizing she is the only person who can hear this unique cat talk, and the two develop a close friendship during the holiday rush. Then one Christmas Eve, Grumpy must reluctantly thwart the kidnapping of an exotic dog she dislikes, and rescue Chyrstal after the mall closes. Through her adventures, will Grumpy learn the true meaning of Christmas? Or will it be, in her words, the "Worst. Christmas. Ever?"
