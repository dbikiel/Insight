Two students and their teacher seem to be literally fighting over the proper solution to a complex mathematical equation. Is it the key to time and space or a coded instruction manual about their own secret urges?
Two students and their teacher seem to be literally fighting over the proper solution to a complex mathematical equation. Is it the key to time and space or a coded instruction manual about their own secret urges? An alchemical action movie? A real life cartoon with original music by Dutch heavyweight Louis Andriessen. Hal Hartley fashioned this whimsical piece of fight choreography with three of his recent performer/collaborators: Miho Nikaido, David Neumann and DJ Mendel.
This film is the visual component of the multi-media collaboration between the composer Louis Andriessen and Hal Hartley. It was first performed in New York by the Sospeso ensemble in 2000. The musical score is available for purchase - it is for an ensemble of violin, traverso and marimba with soprano voice. There are currently, 2007, no commercially available recordings of the music or the accompanying film. The film takes the form of a stylised seminar between a teacher and his students.
