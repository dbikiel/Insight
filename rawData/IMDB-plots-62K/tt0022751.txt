Gangsters posing as police officers offer a woman a chance to make money if she helps them out.
Rick and Dot, two penniless New Yorkers, meet and fall in love in Central Park. Promising to meet later, they separate. Dot is picked up by small-time hood Nick Sarno, posing as a police inspector, who promises to pay her $100 to help in a sting operation at a local charity benefit. She agrees, unaware that Nick and his gang are merely using her to steal the charity receipts themselves. Rick, picked up by Sarno for being seen talking to Dot, is held captive by the gang at their hideout. He breaks loose and rushes to the charity affair to try to save Dot before she becomes involved in the heist.
