A writer documents the journey his family takes to Mongolia to consult with nomadic shamans on the healing of their autistic son.
OVER THE HILLS AND FAR AWAY chronicles the journey of the Isaacson family as they travel through Mongolia in search of a mysterious shaman who they believe can heal their autistic son. This film delves into the strange world of autism, horses, shamanism, and Mongolia while telling the story of a family that will go to the end of the earth to find a way into their son's life.
Formerly titled "Over the Hills and Far Away", this chronicles Rowan and his familys journey across this vast, wild landscape. It delves into the strange world of autism itself, the relationship between humans and animals, between different cultures, different ways of being (autistic versus normal, or neuro-typical), and the nature of healing. We hear the varied theories on autism from the experts in the field, well-known researchers of autism such as Dr Simon Baron-Cohen of Cambridge University, Dr Temple Grandin, recovered autist and professor of animal behaviour at Colorado State University, and Anthropologist and researcher Roy Richard Grinker of the George Washington University. But above all, Over the Hills and Far Away tells the story of a family that goes to the end of the earth to find a way into their son's life. [D-Man2010]
