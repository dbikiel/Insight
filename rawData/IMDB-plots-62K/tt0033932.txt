Caroline Mason, on vacation with her father Mr. Bliss in Idaho, has fallen in love with gaucho Paco Del Valle, the two who plan to get married. The problem is is that she's already married, for five years, to New York publisher Anthony Mason, who couldn't go along on this trip since he had to work. Caroline admits that she loves Anthony, but she believes she is no longer in love with him. Conversely, Anthony still loves his wife and he believes she truly still is in love with him. This situation is somewhat déjà vu, as rather than follow the old adage "Absence makes the heart grow fonder", Caroline tends to forget easily those with who she has lost contact, including Anthony. This situation is reminiscent of one two years earlier when on vacation in Florida with her father, Caroline was ready to marry Paul Martindale. But Anthony, who had more than a sneaking suspicion of what Caroline was up to, decided to come to Florida to outmaneuver the game that Caroline and Paul had concocted to tell him to get what they wanted without rancor. The problem for Caroline and Paul in that situation was that they had no idea that they were indeed embroiled in a game with Anthony until it was all over. But will this situation with Paco be any different?
Caroline and Anthony Mason have been married for five years. Due to his successful business, Anthony spends a lot of time away from Caroline. Her father, Bliss, likes Anthony as he has big houses and a large staff of servants. Even though Caroline loves Anthony, she is 'in love' with another man every two or three years. It is at these times that Anthony arrives to save the marriage.
