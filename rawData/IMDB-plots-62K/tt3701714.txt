A charming yet troubled man spirals into a rage after being rejected by the woman he initially seduced.
On her bachelorette-party weekend with friends in New Orleans, Tara (Jamie Alexander) falls for the darkly-sexy bartender Patrick (Wes Bentley). Waking in his bed the next morning, Tara instantly regrets her unfaithfulness and flies back home to her fianc√© (Cam Gigandet). Her secret flame becomes a full-on fire when Patrick shows up at her house, surreptitiously tries to cancel her wedding arrangements, and stalks her every move. He spirals into madness and delusion, determined to have Tara no matter what the cost. When his efforts fail, he tracks the newlyweds on their honeymoon where he erupts in a psychotic, murderous rage. Tara will have to find the strength she never knew she possessed to stop Patrick from destroying her marriage and her life.
