An 11-year-old boy's amazing ability to break wind leads him first to fame and then to death row, before it helps him to fulfill his ambition of becoming an astronaut.
Patrick Smash (11) was born with two stomachs, and hence the uncontrollable 'talent' to produce ungodly farts. This soon drives his own dad away and makes his social life hell. His only friend is classmate Alan A. Allen, a prodigy genius, who has no sense of smell. Even Alan's invention Thunderpants, which renders Patrick's farts harmless, can't make his space travel dream realistic. However after the invention of an adaptation which turns it into flying fuel, Alan is recruited by the US space center. Patrick becomes word class tenor Sir John Osgood's secret high C farter. Their reunion is even more incredible.
Much like a cow, the school's most unpopular eleven-year-old, Patrick Smash, is privileged--or cursed--with two stomachs. As a result, this extraordinary characteristic comes with an utterly embarrassing problem: should he choose it, Patrick can break wind like a demigod at any given time. As his best and only friend--the child prodigy, Alan A. Allen, who lacks the sense of smell--struggles to work out a way to tame Patrick's explosive gift, American astronauts face unforeseen complications in outer space. Can Patrick with the aid of Alan's innovative "Thunderpants" device save the day?
