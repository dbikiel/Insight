Spain in the mid-seventeenth century. A series of bloody wars has ravaged the nation. Don Juan the nobleman and his valet, Sganarelle, roam the countryside on horseback, on the run and lost. Don Juan promised to marry Donna Elvira and then forsook her. He is such a womanizer - when being saved by a fisherman from ship wreck, he causes two beautiful girls from the fishing village, Mathurine and Charlotte, fighting with each other to win his heart (and yet he never takes them seriously). Alonso and Don Carlos, Donna's brothers, are pursuing him like textbook medieval heroes bent on avenging the insult to their family's honor.
