The U. S. Marines land in Iceland during World War Two and James Murray (John Payne), a brash lady-killer makes a pass at a local beauty, Katina Jonsdottir (Sonja Henie) and is amazed to find it taken as a proposal of marriage. Idelandic customs don't allow for casual propositions. His buddy, Slip Rigges (Jack Oakie), tries to help him out of this predicament but hampers more than he helps, especially when James begins to think the idea of marriage to the charming Katia is appealing.
