After prosecuting a female doctor for mercy-killing, a district-attorney hires the same doctor to care for his mentally-ill wife.
A physician named Christine Allison is employed by an attorney who formerly prosecuted her on charges of euthanasia to watch over his mentally ill wife.
Christine Allison is a medical doctor convicted of manslaughter for assisting a suicide. She is struck off the register and serves 18 months in prison but on her release, she has few job opportunities. She can no longer practice medicine and has few other skills to offer. She finally does get an offer to care for a sick woman but on arrival, she is shocked to find that her employer is Stephen Dane, the barrister who successfully prosecuted her. Dane's wife, Liane, is mentally ill but Christine learns that there are secrets in that household. When someone is killed by an overdose of medication, Christine becomes the obvious suspect.
