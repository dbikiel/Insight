Growing up gay in the South, a high school girl seeks the help of a therapist to come out to her family and friends in this coming-of-age, coming-of-gay story.
Alone with People" is a short film inspired by Quinn Marcus' one woman show "Chasing Ballerinas." The film follows Andie, a high school girl growing up gay in Georgia. Andie handles being a lesbian in the South the only way she can -- secretly being in love with all her sister's friends, having a boyfriend so no one suspects her of being gay and watching the L Word on volume 3. She's not ready to talk about it with her family and friends, who she worries would disown her if they found out. Too afraid to confide in anyone who knows her, Andie seeks comfort in a therapist who helps her realize that she has to first accept herself before she can expect anyone else too.
