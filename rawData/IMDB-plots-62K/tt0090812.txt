A man lives a poor lifestyle in a small town with his older brothers. He is unemployed and commits himself to be a wrestler, but he has to promise to be celibate until he is 40 years old.
Charandas lives a poor lifestyle in a small town in India along with his older brother, Bhajandas, and Bhabhi. He is unemployed and commits himself to be a wrestler with Ustad Mastram Pahelwan, who gets him to promise to be celibate until he is 40 years of age. But when Charandas meets with a school student, Chameli, the daughter of a low-caste Coal merchant, both fall head-over-heels in love with each other, go on dates, exchange love letters, much to the chagrin of Chameli's dad, Kallumal, who has plans to be the next Municipal Chairman, and mom, Champa, who decide to enlist the help of Champa's brother, Chaganlal, as well as arrange Chameli's marriage with Advocate Makhan, the son of Lachuram, who is of their caste. As events hilarious spiral out of control, Charandas must now decide whether he prefers to be known as the semi-senile lover, Majnu, or as Prithviraj Chauhan, who dared to abduct his future wife, amidst stiff all-round opposition.
