A con artist masquerades a Russian nobility and attempts to seduce the wife of an American diplomat.
"Count" Karanzim, a Don Juan is with his cousins in Monte Carlo, living from faked money and the money he gets from rich ladies, who are attracted by his charmes and his title or his militaristic and aristocratic behaviour. He tries to have success with Mrs Hughes, the wife of the new US ambassador.
A Russian emigre leases a villa near Monte Carlo after WWI, and poses as a count in order to take advantage of women, with the aid of two of his mistresses pretending to be his cousins, attempts to swindle unsuspecting women and citizens in Monte Carlo. They hatch a scheme to ingratiate themselves with the American ambassador and his gullible wife. Mrs. Hughes wants some excitement, and he seduces her. While the Count relates his sob story about needing 90,000 francs to Mrs. Hughes, the maid in jealousy sets the house on fire. Both escape the flames, but the Count does not escape his just desserts.
