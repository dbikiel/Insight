The film chronicles the life and revolutionary times of the former death row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal.
Unlike any other film, book, or article produced about Mumia Abu-Jamal, "Mumia: Long Distance Revolutionary" focuses on his career as a prolific author and broadcaster from Pennsylvania's Death Row. In fact, the film does not deal with Abu-Jamal's case, but rather chronicles his life and work as a journalist and revolutionary - both prior and post incarceration. After Abu-Jamal is convicted for the murder of of Philadelphia patrolman Daniel Faulkner, the story then exposes Abu-Jamal's battles with the American court system to continue his work from prison- a battle he continues to wage to this very day.
