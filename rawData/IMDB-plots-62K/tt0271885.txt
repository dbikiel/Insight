An autistic 15-year-old boy steals money from his boss to provide rent for his abusive father, who uses the money to repay a loan shark.
Dean Singer has terminal cancer, yet is determined to spend his last days taking care of his 15 year-old 'big brother program' protégé, Louis 'Zig Zag' Fletcher. Dean got Louis a dishwasher job in shamelessly abusive, exploiting Mr. 'The Toad' Walters' restaurant. Louis' dead-beat, neglecting yet abusive dad pushes him for 'rent' (actually to repay violent loan-shark Cadillac Tom), which the half-wit gets by - stealing from Walters' safe, remembering numbers being his only talent. Singer is determined to return the money, despite excessive risks, with surprising allies.
