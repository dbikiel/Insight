Thérèse Langlois, who runs a small café in the suburbs of Paris, lives alone, awaiting her long lost husband. One day she thinks she recognizes him in a tramp walking past her establishment. It must be said that her spouse has not shown any signs of life ever since he had disappeared during the World War Two. Because the stranger has lost his memory, Thérèse tries hard to stir up memories in him but she fails. Is the stranger really the man of her life? Anyway, the tramp disappears once more. Alone again, Thérèse still hopes he will come back.
