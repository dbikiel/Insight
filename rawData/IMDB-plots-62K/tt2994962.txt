Jiro has come home. His tiny farming village is now deserted because it lies in the badly contaminated Fukushima zone. Nonetheless, Jiro begins cultivating his land. An old school friend helps him and together they plant rice. "It's like slow suicide", says Jiro's friend. Jiro's half-brother, Soichi, who has evacuated with his family cannot believe that Jiro has moved back into the old home. Soichi's step-mother, who is Jiro's biological mother, had never got over Jiro leaving. Suffused with grief and poetry, the images in this film describes life after the nuclear catastrophe. They also tell us what it means to go home when home will never be the same again.
