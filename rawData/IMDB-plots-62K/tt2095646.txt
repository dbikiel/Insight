A doctor unrelentingly tries to convince a phobic guy to come out of his isolation room.
A doctor tries to convince a phobic guy to leave the padded cell where he voluntarily lives; he tells him about the many good things he'll find outside and uses different techniques trying to lessen the guy's fear to cross the door. The guy, instead, is horrified about what is beyond the door, and he seems happy and comfortably settled in his Spartan room, which he imagines as a paradisaical Eden where he has everything he need. Now, is he going to get out?
