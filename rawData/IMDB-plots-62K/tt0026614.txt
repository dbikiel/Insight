John Middleton is investigating cattle rustling when he is captured and tossed into a cave with Emmett, a rancher who disappeared earlier. They help each other escape and learn that a local banker is trying to scare everyone away to grab up some secret gold mines.
When Middleton's friend Mason asks for help, he sends his son John. John arrives to find Mason missing and Burns' gang controlling the town. After bringing provisions to the besieged town, he plans a cattle drive. But Banker Carter gets the ranchers to start the drive early so Burns' gang can rustle them. The gang also makes John a prisoner to keep him out of the way.
