A suicide bomber becomes dependent on the kindness of strangers when his explosives won't detonate, giving him time to meet some of the people he's targeting.
The story takes place during one weekend in Tel-Aviv, in three main spots that lead to Carmel Market. There are three protagonists: 1. Tarek, a young Palestinian man from Nablus. 2. Katz, an embittered old fellow. 3. Keren, a 17-year-old girl who grew up in a strictly religious family and left home to become a secular youngster. The three "heroes" are loners, driven by their past and by their inner conviction.
