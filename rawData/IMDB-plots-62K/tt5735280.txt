In the throes of a zombie apocalypse, a troubled woman from Las Vegas with a dark past finds herself stranded in the desert with a lone and ravenous zombie on her tail.
This is it. What humanity feared the most is already happening, as a virulent pandemic sweeps the globe from end to end like a pitiless scourge, leaving behind legions of freshly-animated decomposing zombies. Under those circumstances, in the carcass of a levelled Las Vegas, a totally unprepared exotic dancer, Molly, crosses the rugged terrain of the unforgiving desert, driven solely by the will to survive, and a motive even greater than her own life. However, she's not alone. Like a powerful flesh-magnet, Molly attracts a ferocious undead male who is craving for a bite of those fragrant and bright-red offals of hers--and wherever Molly goes, the walking dead predator follows. In the end, do zombies ever get tired?
