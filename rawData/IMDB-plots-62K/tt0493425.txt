Hard as nails 22 year old convicted felon VICTORIA WALKER is given a tough choice by a judge: stay clean and get a job or go to jail.
Hard as nails 22 year old thief and prostitute VICTORIA WALKER is given a tough choice by a judge: get a legal job or go to jail. Victoria's bad attitude and demeanor slams the door on all her job opportunities except for a helpmate position with a wealthy and elderly Palm Beach woman. Althea Jaffery, age 77, takes an unusual liking to Victoria and hires her on the spot beginning a relationship between two women that are worlds apart. The unconditional love of Althea peels away the hardness in Victoria, allowing her to reveal her dark and secret past, while the persistent and confrontational Victoria discovers that Althea has been hiding from a dark and secret past as well. These two women, once with little in common, find themselves at the same point in their lives; discovering that a key to life is the power of forgiveness.
