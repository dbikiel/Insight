An ordinary-looking chair refuses to be sat upon.
A young man wishes to sit down on a plain white chair in order to read. The chair resists this whole idea strenuously. Finally the young man admits defeat and sits on the floor. But left on its own the chair becomes lonesome... The music is provided by Ravi Shankar, years before the Beatles spread his name far and wide.
An avid young bibliophile reading a book spots an ordinary empty chair and tries to sit down on it to resume his reading. However, much to the man's surprise, this insolent high-backed seat detests any interaction with humans, and to be more specific, being sat upon. Suddenly, as the determined man struggles to succeed, a bizarre and frantic dance unfolds before our eyes, accompanied by Ravi Shankar's unrestrained sitar ragas and Chatur Lal's complex tabla rhythms. In the end, can man and object reach an agreement?
