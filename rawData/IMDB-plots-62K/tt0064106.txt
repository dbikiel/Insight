In the village of Tremolat, PÃ©rigord, the lonely headmistress Helene befriends the local butcher Popaul at the wedding party of her colleague, Leon Hamel. In spite of their friendship, they do not become lovers as Helene is still recovering from the disillusionment of her last relationship. On Popaul's birthday, Helene gives him a lighter as a gift. During the excursion with her class to a cave in the woods, Helene finds the latest victim of a serial killer that is stabbing young women in the area.

Helene enjoyed Popaul's company and could do anything for him. Their relationship deepened, until some unexplained murders started to occur in the village...
