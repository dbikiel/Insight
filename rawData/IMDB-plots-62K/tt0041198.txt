Mexican and American federal agents tackle a vicious gang exploiting illegal farm workers in southern California.
To penetrate a gang exploiting illegal Mexican farmworkers smuggled into California (and leaving no live witnesses), Mexican federal agent Pablo Rodriguez poses as an ignorant bracero, while his American counterpart Jack Bearnes works from outside. Soon, both are in deadly danger from the ringleader, sinister rancher Owen Parkson, and find night on the farm to be full of shadowy film-noir menace...
When several illegal Mexican workers are murdered at the border of Mexico and United States by a gang of Coyotes, the Mexican and American federal agents Pablo Rodriguez and Jack Bearnes are assigned to work infiltrated in the group of Mexican farm workers that are waiting for a chance to work in southern California. Pablo poses of bracero while Jack poses of a dealer of permits to work in the United State to discover the leaders that exploit the laborers. They stumble upon the rancher Owen Parkson and they find he is the ringleader. But soon they are in danger and do not have means to communicate with their contacts. What will happen to Jack and Pablo?
Illegal Mexican migrant workers paying coyotes for the chance to cross the border and work for unethical American rancher Owen Parkson are ambushed and killed upon their return to Mexico by soulless bandits. To stop the vicious cycle of exploitation and murder, Mexican federal agent Pablo Rodriguez is assigned to infiltrate a group of 'braceros' in cooperation with American federal agent Jack Bearnes. Risking their lives to uphold the laws of their respective countries, the success of the operation depends on Pablo and Jack's ability to outsmart the predators without becoming the prey.
Workers crossing illegally into California are being waylaid and killed on their return to Mexico. Law enforcement officers from the two countries team up to infiltrate the ring involved in the smuggling.
