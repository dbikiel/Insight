The mutant sharks from Dr. Craven's experiments in "Shark Attack 1" are back, this time choosing Cape Town, South Africa as their hunting ground. Two sisters, Amy and Samantha, while diving near a wreck in the reef are attacked by a shark; Samantha survives. One week later, Dr. Nick Harris and his assistant get the shark and install it as a new attraction at Water World - a Sea World rip-off. When the shark escapes, Nick and Samantha go to hunt it and discover that there are 6 mutant Great Whites living in a cave near the beach, and the Water World's surfing competition might be the next victim! Now they team up with Roy - a Discovery Channel shark hunter - to kill the beasts and save Cape Town.
