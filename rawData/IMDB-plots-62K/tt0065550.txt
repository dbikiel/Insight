The other men help him find back bits of his past, until they arrive at a village where two warring families recognize him.

His younger brother is jealous of the attention the prodigal son receives, and things come to a dramatic end.
A gang of robbers sets a diversionary fire in a madhouse as part of their plot to steal a gold shipment. Four inmates escape together.
