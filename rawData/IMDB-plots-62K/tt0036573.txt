Women in a French Internment camp conceal downed British airmen from Nazi soldiers, and try to help them escape. Produced by Edward Black. Written and directed by Frank Launder.
In the darkest hours of World War II, France falls to the Germans and all English women in the country are rounded-up and forced into internment camps. Fearful of being deported to the Gestapo's brothels, over 2,000 English women bide their time in an aging chateau which serves as their prison. Females of all walks of life and classes are thrown together and forced to live a humiliating existence where they must beg for even the most basic privileges. Freda, who hides a treacherous secret, is an journalist who had lived a posh existence writing human interest stories for the dailies. She spars with sultry and free-loving Bridie, who is willing to trade her affections for black market goods. New prisoner Rose finds herself leading the underground when two RAF pilots crash behind enemy lines and seek aid in getting back to England.
