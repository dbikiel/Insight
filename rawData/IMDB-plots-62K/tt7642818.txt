Life of a singer, her daughter and her friends change when they meet with a divorced man.
The neurotic Fikret and tavern singer Solmaz, whose 21 year long relationships end on the same day, meet through a funny coincidence. When Solmaz's daughter Zeynep decides to marry her lover from Adana, the ever-fearful Fikret ends up having to play the role of his life. Intended at first to be kept in the fami-ly, the wedding becomes a much bigger event upon the insistence of the groom's relatives. Can our heroes come to terms with the traditional Adana fami-ly who carry guns and own a kebab restaurant chain, and see the wedding through without mishaps?
