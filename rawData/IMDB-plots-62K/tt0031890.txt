Simon Templar, the Saint, travels to San Francisco to solve crime mysteries within the police department.
A disgraced policeman's daughter in San Francisco is busy acquiring a name for herself as a crime boss in her own right. But when Simon Templar helps her get away after a shooting in a night-club and subsequently chooses to bring down his old acquaintance Inspector Fernack from New York, the question as to who is on which side of the law becomes increasingly confused -- especially when the vital evidence, in the shape of eighty thousand stolen dollars, spends most of the film in the Saint's pocket!
Simon Templar involves himself in the mysterious case of a San Francisco crime ring head by an elusive character known only as Waldeman. Police Inspector Travers has committed suicide after being discharged from the police force on suspicion of being part of the gang, and his daughter, Valarie, has organized her own crime ring in order to bring out the mysterious Waldeman and prove her father's innocence. Templar meets Inspector Fernak on the flight to California, and the two longtime enemy-cronies form an alliance to help run down the mysterious criminal, whom the Inspector suspects may be Templar himself.
