Someone is viciously murdering people, people with criminal pasts. It appears that the murders may be linked to the disappearance of a young girl 15 years previously.
It's been 15 years since the disappearance of little Francesca, daughter of the renowned storyteller, poet and dramatist Vittorio Visconti, and the community is stalked by a psychopath bent on cleaning the city of "impure and damned souls". Moretti and Succo, questioned by the ineffectiveness of the police force, are the detectives in charge of elucidating the mystery surrounding these "Dantesque" crimes. Francesca seems to have returned, but she is not be the same girl who everyone knew . . .
