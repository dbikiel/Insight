A sincere young man leaves his home to win his fortune so he can marry his home town sweetheart.
Buster goes away to the city to prove to his girl's father he can succeed. He writes her of his various jobs which she glorifies in her imagination. She sees a surgeon, he is a vet's assistant; she sees him cleaning up on Wall Street, he's really a janitor.
A young man proposes a young woman, but her father questions how he might support his daughter after the marriage. The youth informs that he will move to New York, find a job and marry the girl. If he fails, he would commit suicide. Once in the big city, he works in many professions and writes to his girlfriend; and his imaginative girl reads each letter and thinks in her beloved being successful on each trial.
