Feudal Japan: Amidst the absolute rule of the Shogun, one man, Shuranosuke Sakaki the master swordsman, furiously protected his independence. Bearing the legendary blade Onimaru he walks alone and unafraid, cutting a swathe through those who stand in his way. Hired by the Tokugawa Shogunate to rescue Princess Mayu from the clutches of a group of bandit ninjas - the Seki Ninja, Shuranosuke must rely upon all his skills as well as the aid of the beautiful ninja thief Orin to stand against the summoned undead spirits of Hell barring his way. Featuring direction by Osamu Dezaki and character designs by frequent collaborator Akio Sugino, Sword for Truth was based on a novel by Jo Toriumi (Yotoden) which also inspired the 1998 live-action film Legend of the Devil.
