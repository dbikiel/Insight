One of WWII's bloodiest battles as the Allies smash through the German lines which have enclosed the Anzio beachhead. Four months and 30,000 casualties before the Allies finally march to Rome.
Allied forces land at Anzio unopposed but instead of moving inland and north to Rome their commanding officer decides to dig in. A battle-hardened war correspondent borrows a jeep and driver and drives to Rome and back encountering no significant German forces. The report on the absence of the enemy is discounted as the general is concerned about having the strength to hold Anzio and support the offensive. By the time it is finally decided to make a move the Germans have arrived in strength. A US Ranger assault on Cisterna is ambushed with most of the forces killed or captured. A small group of survivors, including the war correspondent, struggle to make their way back to Anzio and report on the German defenses.
The Allies land in Anzio, Italy in January 1944, just south of Rome. Two battalions of US Rangers attempt to move inland to Cisterna and are ambushed. A small handful of survivors, including a war correspondent, struggle to return to Anzio.
