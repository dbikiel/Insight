A romantic drama that charts the lives of three women from different backgrounds, forever changed when they emigrate to New Zealand as war brides.
In 1953, a flood adding to the aftermath of World War II swells the numbers of Dutch emigrants. On a KLM flight to New Zealand, part of a race from London, Frank, who lost his family and colonial estate in the Japanese occupation and Indonesian civil war of Independence, meets some virtual mail order brides. Ada van Holland becomes his lover before confessing she's already married by proxy to gloomy Calvinist Derk. Jewish concentration-camp survivor Esther dodges her engagement for a fashion career and discreetly has her son Bobby adopted by infertile Marjorie, who did everything else right with husband Hans. Over the years, some of their paths cross again, and all of the survivors meet at Frank's funeral.
