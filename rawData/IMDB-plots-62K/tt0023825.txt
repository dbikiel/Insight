Sexpot film star Lola Burns seeks a new image and tries marrying a marquis and adopting a baby - all sorts of schemes which go awry.
Lola Burns is at the top of the pile in Hollywood. But life ain't easy, what with her father and brother always hanging around for handouts, and devious studio publicity honcho Space Hanlon cooking up endless lurid newspaper stories. Makes a girl want to give up pictures.
Lola Burns is arguably the most beautiful, famous and temperamental movie star in Hollywood. She is constantly surrounded by her entourage. Included within this group are her personal secretary, her father and her brother who want their pound of flesh from the famous Lola. It also includes a corral of beaus and wannabe beaus. But her best friend and her worst enemy is Space Hanlon, the studio publicist who is jealous of all the other men in Lola's life. Space created "Lola Burns", the "Hollywood Bombshell" as the public refers to her. Space's approach to his job seemingly is the old motto that no publicity is bad publicity. The publicity that he develops for Lola primarily leans toward the salacious. Lola, getting tired of being treated solely as a studio commodity, contemplates giving up her movie career. Her resolve in this direction is strengthened when she meets Gifford Middleton of the Boston Middletons. Space's spin machine hasn't even managed to penetrate the shell of the upper crust Middletons, who have never heard of Lola. As such, Gifford loves Lola for who she really is. Space will do whatever he needs to to protect his job, and regain his favorite client and his true love.
