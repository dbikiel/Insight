A 19-year-old girl prepares to become a suicide bomber in Times Square. She speaks with a nondescript American accent, and it's impossible to pinpoint her ethnicity. We never learn why she made her decision -- she has made it already. We don't know whom she represents, what she believes in - we only know she believes it absolutely.
Standing at 5'6", a 19 year old female, of unknown racial origin and religion, volunteers to be a suicide bomber. She is provided with a backpack containing explosives, detailed instructions by a masked female and several masked men, and is told that her name is Leah Cruz, and is born on April 10, 1987. Appropriately dressed, she is told to push a button on her ear-phones when she reaches a crowded place in Times Square New York - an action that will detonate the explosives in the backpack. All identification is removed from her person, she is blindfolded and driven to a transit stop from where she will board a bus to her destination and ultimately find her way to carry out her deadly task.
