When the loot from a botched bank robbery disappears, the Hogan gang takes over the whole town and threatens to kill everyone if the loot is not found.
Part of an outlaw gang rides into town to rob the bank and their accomplice is the local undertaker. The robbery goes awry and they are captured but the money is not found. While the prisoners are being transferred, the rest of the gang overpowers the posse, frees the prisoners, and returns to town. The undertaker's wife finds the money and tries to flee putting the townspeople's life in jeopardy as the outlaw leader plans to start shooting them unless he gets the money.
Dirk Hogan (Neville Brand), leader of an outlaw gang, sends "Whitey" Turner (David Brian), who is planning a double-cross, into the town of Gunsight Pass as the first step in a split-second scheme to rob the bank. But the robbery is disrupted by a wedding reception for the banker's son, Roy Hanford (Richard Long) and his bride, Kathy Phillips (Lisa Davis). The gold is cached by a gang member, later killed. Hogan takes over the town, threatening to kill a man every half-hour until the gold is turned over to him.
