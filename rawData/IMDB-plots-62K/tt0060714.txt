After his wife leaves him for his former best friend, a failed London artist begins his descent into madness in trying to win her back.
Morgan Delt is a failed and irresponsible left-wing artist whose Communist parents own a fish and chips shop in downmarket London. He is also an aggressive and self-admitted dreamer obsessed with Karl Marx, gorillas and stopping his beautiful wife from marrying his former best friend. He uses his rich fantasy world as refuge from external reality, where his unconventional behavior lands him in a divorce from his wife, trouble with the police and, ultimately, incarceration in an insane asylum.
