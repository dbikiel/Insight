Two miserable people find happiness together: a man dreaming of flying, and a woman dreaming of living.
A dreamer who aspires to human flight is assigned public service after one of his attempts off a public building. This leads him to meeting a young woman, who is dying of motor neuron disease. The strong-willed woman admits her wish to be de-flowered before her death. The man, struggling to maintain his relationship with his girlfriend, declines, but offers to help pay for a gigolo to do the deed. The following events play off the inherent comedy and drama of the circumstances.
