In this modern day drama, Oscar-winner Melissa Leo beautifully conveys the heart-wrenching struggle that comes with love and addiction, while also lightheartedly depicting a woman rediscovering romance. She plays hopelessly hopeful Faye, mother to Sylvie (Marin Ireland) who, many months after a car accident, continues to complain of back pain. After refusing physical therapy, it becomes clear to everyone but Faye that her daughter is addicted to pain killers. When earnest environmentalist Beckett (Josh Hamilton) moves to town, Faye quickly befriends him, hoping that he will be the solution to Sylvie's problems. As Beckett finds himself further intertwined in their lives, he inadvertently helps Faye realize the depth of her family's problem, even as he brings a touch of happiness. Before too long Faye's hand is forced, and she must decide whether to protect her daughter or find the happiness that she has long denied herself.
