This film explores the ins and outs of the Dominici Affair that made the headlines back in 1952. As a result of the case, a family man named Gaston Dominici was sentenced to death for the slaying of a family of English tourists alongside a road running past his property, despite the existence of no material proof or motive to incriminate him.
