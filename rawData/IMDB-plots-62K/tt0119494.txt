Three young women from very different walks of life join the women's land army during World War II and are sent to work together on a farm in Dorset and the experience changes their lives forever.
During World War II, the organisation "The Women's Land Army" recruited women to work on British farms while the men were off to war. Three such "land girls" of different social backgrounds - quiet Stella, young hairdresser Prue, and Cambridge graduate Ag - become best friends in spite of their different backgrounds.
It is England in 1941 in the glorious Dorset countryside. Three beautiful young women, Stella, Ag and Prue, arrive on a remote farm. They are the 'Land Girls' - city girls who have volunteered to take the place of young men who have gone to war. They are an unlikely trio: Prue is vivacious and sexy; Ag is quiet and more reserved; while the dreamy, beautiful Stella is in love with Philip, a dashing naval officer. Despite their differences, they soon become close friends. The film follows their relationships with each other and the men in their lives in the face of war.
