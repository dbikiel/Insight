A charming scoundrel reflects on his exploits, from childhood through to manhood.
Life story of a charming scoundrel, with little dialogue other than the star/director's witty narration. As a boy, only he survives a family tragedy when he's deprived of supper (poisonous mushrooms!) for stealing...concluding that dishonesty pays. Through years of dabbling in crime and amusing adventures, two women appear and reappear in his life, a dazzling blonde jewel thief and a stunning brunette gambler. Finally, he meets the mysterious Charbonnier who had saved his life in World War I, leading to the surprising next phase in his career...
Sitting by himself in a caf√© on his 54th birthday, a cheater recalls his life. He was left an orphan and alone at 12 years of age when 11 members of his family died from eating poison mushrooms. He had survived because he's stolen a bit of money and was being punished. After a cousin cheated him of his inheritance, he set off to make his own fortune. He worked as a doorman and then a porter in a hotel. He completes his military service, or so he thinks, and soon finds himself fighting in World War I. Life got vastly more interesting when he met an attractive jewel thief - perhaps too exciting as he fled as soon a chance presented itself. Women were never absent in his life and many came and went. He remembers his wife, who he met while working as a croupier at the roulette wheel, with great fondness. After being falsely accused of cheating and fired by the casino, he decides to take to cheating at cards, something he's quite good at. An unexpected encounter has him once again on the straight and narrow but with temptation all around him, there is only one profession he can possibly take up.
