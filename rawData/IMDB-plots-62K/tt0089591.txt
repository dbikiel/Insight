Garret goes to Miami and gets murdered after 7 years in prison for a $20,000,000 bank robbery. The money and the 2 others were never found. The Trinity bros. go to Miami as cops to solve the case this time. Fun fights.
In 1978, $20 million was stolen from a Detroit bank. One of the robbers was caught, one was found dead, and the third disappeared. The money was never found. Seven years later, the robber who was caught was released from jail. He immediately went to Miami, only to be found dead the next day. Now FBI agents Doug Bennet and Steve Forest have been called in to investigate the case while posing as Miami police officers. Somewhere in Miami the third robber is hiding with his $20 million, and he has a seven-year head start on the authorities.
