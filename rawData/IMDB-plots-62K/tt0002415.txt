A lonely young woman lives with her strict father who forbids her to wear make-up. One day at an ice cream social, she meets a young man you seems interested in her. However, unknown to her, he is a burglar who is only interested in breaking into her father's house. One night she is awakened by a noise. Grabbing a pistol, she enters her father's downstairs office where she confronts a masked intruder . . .
The elder daughter has always been her father's favorite because of her strict adherence to his rigid precepts. The younger daughter is rather gay and frivolous, though innocently so, and horrifies her elder sister when the latter catches her in the act of powdering and painting her face. To the mild reprimand of the elder daughter the younger exclaims, "Well, you have to do it if you want to be attractive." The strength of the assertion is proven at the church lawn festival, the younger sister being surrounded by a host of friends while the elder passes the time in almost absolute ostracism. However, a stranger appears at the festival who pretends to be attracted by the elder daughter, she, in turn, being surprised and flattered. This is for a sinister purpose, however, for the stranger is a crook. Under the pretense of affection for the girl he gains her confidence regarding her father's business affairs, and with the knowledge he has acquired, he attempts to rob the house. This attempt works disaster for himself and the girl.
