Four Hispanic high school students form a robotics club. With no experience, 800 bucks, used car parts and a dream, this rag tag team goes up against the country's reigning robotics champion, MIT.
Four Hispanic high school students form a robotics club under the leadership of their school's newest teacher, Fredi.
