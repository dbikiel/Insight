A traditional Turkish woman tries to find love and is forced by her family members to get married.
The Husband Factor is the story of Efsun (30) who seeks true love and a romantic relationship rather than a husband. She is the black sheep of her peers and the women of her family who are programmed for marriage. She is seeking love yet she does not know what most girls know; how to strike an attitude, or how to manipulate a man. Hence, she has not had a single steady relationship to date. The good news is that her family is dedicated to initiating Efsun into the intricacies of womanhood and ensuring that she gets hitched into the happily ever after. Efsun surrenders herself into the capable hands of these women. As they are getting ready to re-launch her, Efsun runs into her high school friend and former flame Sinan. He is the one, the boyfriend she was never able to get over or replace.
