The Plot is too tiny. Pls feel free to expand.For the third time, the evil Wishmaster returns with more evil and grotesquery to wreck the life of more innocents. This time, his victim is a beautiful, innocent and studious teenage girl named Diana Collins who accidentally opened up the Djinn's tomb (a strange box with a jewel inside) and released him. After gaining his freedom, the Djinn (disguised as an unlucky professor) goes into a murderous frenzy throughout her college campus, in an effort to find Diana and force her to fulfill her three wishes. While Diana is on the run, she must endeavor to prevent the Djinn from subjecting the entire world to Hell's wrath. Diana uses one of her wishes (the second one) to summon the archangel Michael who possesses the body of her boyfriend, Greg, but even he cannot kill the Djinn as only the one who awakened him can do it with Michael's sword which Diana cannot yet wield. In the end, Diana's attempt to sacrifice herself (attempts to jump off a building) gives her the ability to wield Michael's sword and she kills the Djinn with it, but is fatally injured when they both fall in the process. Michael heals her wounds before returning to Heaven, and Diana is finally able to admit she loves her boyfriend, who has returned to normal, though injured.
