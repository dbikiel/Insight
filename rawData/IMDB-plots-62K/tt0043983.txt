A brother and sister dance act encounter challenges and romance when booked in London during the Royal Wedding.
Tom and Ellen Bowen are a brother and sister dance act whose show closes in New York. Their agent books them in London for the same period as the Royal Wedding. They travel by ship where Ellen meets and becomes involved with Lord John Brindale. This causes her to miss a rehearsal. Tom (Astaire) uses the time to dance with a hat rack and gym equipment. Later Tom and Ellen attempt a graceful dance number as the ship rolls. Upon arrival Tom holds auditions and meets Anne. There is much indecision by the siblings about their romantic partners even though they are in-the-clouds. Tom dances on the walls and ceiling of his hotel room. All ends well in this light musical. By the way, there is a vaudeville-style dance number in their show that features slapstick. It's a hoot.
Stage stars Tom and Ellen Bowen embark to open their show in England. Innocent-seeming Ellen is a female Don Juan and doesn't take dancing as seriously as brother Tom; on shipboard she meets her match, Lord John Brindale. Arrived in London, confirmed bachelor Tom auditions and is taken with cool dancer Anne Ashmond. Will romance break up the act?
Fred Astaire (Tom) and Jane Powell (Ellen) are asked to perform as a dance team in England at the time of Princess Elizabeth's wedding. As brother and sister, each develops a British love interest, Ellen with Lord John Brindale (Peter Lawford) and Tom with dancer Anne Ashmond (Sarah Churchill--Winston's daughter). Astaire famously dances on the walls and ceiling of his hotel room, and Powell's coloratura voice and comedic touches are featured in several vocals.
