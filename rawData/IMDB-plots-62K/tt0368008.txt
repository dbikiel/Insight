In the midst of the Gulf War, soldiers are kidnapped and brainwashed for sinister purposes.
When his army unit was ambushed during the first Gulf War, Sergeant Raymond Shaw saved his fellow soldiers just as his commanding officer, then-Captain Ben Marco, was knocked unconscious. Brokering the incident for political capital, Shaw eventually becomes a vice-presidential nominee, while Marco is haunted by dreams of what happened -- or didn't happen -- in Kuwait. As Marco (now a Major) investigates, the story begins to unravel, to the point where he questions if it happened at all. Is it possible the entire unit was kidnapped and brainwashed to believe Shaw is a war hero as part of a plot to seize the White House? Some very powerful people at Manchurian Global corporation appear desperate to stop him from finding out.
This is a remake of the 1962 thriller of soldiers, returning from war, who have been brainwashed and programmed to kill. The movie has been updated from the Korean War era to the war in Iraq (Desert Storm). Captain Bennett Marco (Denzel Washington) is now playing Frank Sinatra's part. Time has passed, and now Major Marco is giving speeches about his platoon being ambushed in the Kuwaiti desert. The Lost Platoon was saved by the heroics of Sergeant Raymond Prentiss Shaw (Liev Schreiber), who received the Medal of Honor. Shaw is now a candidate, running for Vice-President of the United States. Marco can't sleep at night, and when he does, he is having nightmares of what really happened in the desert. He thinks Shaw might not be a hero, and that he may have had something to do with the death of two soldiers in the desert. Marco tries to find the truth and people around him begin to die. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy)
