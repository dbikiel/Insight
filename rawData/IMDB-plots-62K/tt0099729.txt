The middle class Hamid Hamoun has been married to painter Mahshid for seven years. However, Mahshid is becoming increasingly frustrated with their existence, and feels that Hamid is somehow holding her back from her true creativity. When she asks for a divorce, Hamid struggles to come to terms with it, in addition to his battle to complete his PhD. In a series of dream sequences that resemble the work of Fellini, Hamid tries to piece together what went wrong. Hailed as Dariush Mehrjui's greatest masterpiece since 'The Cow,' this compelling film uses subtle humor to tell the story of one man's heartbreaking loss.
