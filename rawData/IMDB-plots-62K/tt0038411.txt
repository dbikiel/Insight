An eight-year-old girl is an unwilling and disturbed witness of parental quarrels in her home, and when the parents finally secure a divorce, the judge decrees that the young girl live with her mother for eight months and her father the other four months. The divided life affects her both mentally and physically.
Eight year old Bobby Carter is the only offspring of Ray and Joan Carter, both her parents who she loves very much. Unlike what Bobby believes is their happy home, Joan has fallen in love with Michael Benton, it which happened in part out of her loneliness when Ray is away on business which is frequently, that loneliness only exacerbated by living in the suburbs where there is nothing of real interest to preoccupy her time. Bobby's first indication that not all is right is when she and her friends spot her mother and Michael, a man she doesn't know, kissing clandestinely in the park, but Bobby still goes into denial about what they were doing. Bobby can't deny the truth any longer when her parents open up to each other about the issue, and decide to get a divorce, Joan who immediately marries Michael. In the judge awarding two-thirds custody to Joan and one-third to Ray in terms of time, the latter who retains the family house, Bobby has to adjust to her new situation, where going in she hates Michael, blames her mother, and believes her father is the victim. As Bobby struggles to make the adjustment, she will find that the lives of the adults and her place are not as clear cut as she initially believed.
