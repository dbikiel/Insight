A tramp finds a gun lying in the street.
Just another day in the life of a tramp. Morose, quiet and with no prospects of getting it better, the life of this tramp will have some unexpected turn of events when the man finds a gun lying on the street. And with that in mind comes a peculiar question: what to do with this weapon? To deliver it to someone who can keep it safe, to some authority or to use to it for a better purpose to himself?
