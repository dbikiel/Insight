A law student witnesses deception, homicide, and crime after being elected as General Secretary of his college.
Bikaner-based 28-year-old Dilip Kumar Singh is enrolled in a Rajpur-based Law college, and rents a room with an unstable male, Rananjay Singh. His attempts to re-locate to a hostel, pits him against a group of men, led by Jadhwal, who not only assault, but also molest him, and then lock him in a dark room with a naked and abused female, Anuja. He recuperates in a hospital and joins hands with Rananjay and Dukey Bana to avenge this humiliation, as well as befriends Anuja, who is a Lecturer in the college. He also decides to support Rananjay, who is legitimate son of a former Raja, to run for college elections - and it is this decision that will shatter and change his life forever.
