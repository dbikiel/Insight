Young Indiana Jones undertakes several perilous missions for the French secret service during the Great War.
Indiana Jones, now a captain in the French army, is assigned to escort two Austrian princes to meet with Emperor Karl I and convince him to broker a peace deal with France and Britain at the expense of Austria's alliance with Germany. Two months later, at the French Embassy in Petrograd, Indy must decide between his loyalty to his friends and his work in French Intelligence when he is pressed to discover details of a possible bolshevik revolution in Russia which would cripple the French war effort.
March 1917, Under the alias of Henri Defence, Indiana Jones was a spy in the Belgian Army. He had to safely escort two Austrian Princes to their family in order for their country to begin a separate peace treatment and deprive Germany of it's strongest ally. By July Indy was working as a translator at the French embassy in Petrograd. There he had befriended a group of young Bolshevik students. On his 18th birthday, they took him to hear Lenin himself giving a speech. Unfortunately, the speech inspires them to a premature revolution attempt.
