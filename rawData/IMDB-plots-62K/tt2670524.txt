Two brothers kidnap a schoolmate to contribute to the family's income.
Yaki and Shaul are two teenage brothers who share a strong, almost telepathic connection. Their family is suffering from an overgrowing debt, which has caused their father to fall into a deep depression. The brothers feel that they can't just stand on the sidelines while their family falls apart. Till recently, they were helpless. But now with Yaki's enlistment to the army, like every other 18 year old Israeli boy, he is given a rifle. This rifle gives the brothers the power they need to act and at once they are transformed from helpless teenagers into men.
