A police inspector, suspecting an attorney of two child sex murders, has him held for a questioning session that goes on for hours.
Inspector Gallien is investigating the rape and murder of two little girls. The only suspect is attorney Jerome Martinaud, but the evidence against him is circumstantial. As the city celebrates New Year's Eve, Gallien calls Martinaud to his office and interrogates him for hour after hour while Martinaud continues to maintain his innocence. We learn all about the evidence; we meet Martinaud's wife and learn all about the rift between the two; but will we, and Gallien, finally learn whether Martinaud is guilty?
In Garde à vue, Inspector Gallien (played by Lino Ventura) investigates the rape and murder of two young girls and targets attorney Jerome Martinaud (played by Michel Serrault), slowly breaking him down psychologically until he confesses to the crimes, even though he did not commit them. Director Miller emphasizes his message about investigatory detention in France by showing that even an experienced attorney can become an unintended victim. Garde à vue is still available only in French, but fortunately the film was re-made in the United States as Under Suspicion.
