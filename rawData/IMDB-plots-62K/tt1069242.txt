From Emmy-winning director and actor Charles S. Dutton, comes the true story of a guard (Dutton) at a Teen Correctional Facility-- who saw the cycle of destructive choices and racial tensions between female teen offenders, and decided to do something about it. He gathered African-American, Latina, and white teens, and put together a multi-racial track team behind the bars of the detention center.
Cleveland "Stack" Stackhouse (played by Emmy Award winner Charles S. Dutton) is a guard with the Texas Correctional Youth Authority who witnesses the cycle of destructive choices and racial tensions among female teen offenders and decides to do something about it. He gathers African-American, Latina and Caucasian teens, and organizes a multi-racial track team behind the bars of the prison. Participation in Stack's track team not only breaks down the racial divides between the girls, but puts them on a path to turn their lives around. (Inspired by a true story.)
