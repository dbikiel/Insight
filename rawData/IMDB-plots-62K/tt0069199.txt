In Utah, the idyllic existence of a mountain lion family is threatened when tourists, bent on sport-hunting cougars, make their appearance.
Utah's Redrock Mesa region is the setting for a cave-dwelling cougar family. Tragedy strikes when the male cougar is shot by a hunter, leaving Seeta, the mother, to provide for and raise her three cubs. These magnificent animals are captured splendidly as they experience growing up and learning to survive in an often harsh and dangerous environment. Contrary to accepted belief, Seeta encounters, and is befriended by, a gentle sheepherder (Arau), debunking the myth that cougars and humans can't co-exist. However, when the hunter returns, intent on tracking down the remainder of the family, Seeta and the shepherd's relationship is tested mightily.
