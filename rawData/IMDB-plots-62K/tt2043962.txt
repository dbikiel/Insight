Marina, an upper-class social worker with a doting husband and an enviable downtown apartment, is suddenly transformed into a bizarre twilight version of herself after having been raped by three policemen.
Marina is an attractive upper-class woman with an opulent wardrobe and a good-looking husband. She's employed as a social worker, a profession offering meager financial rewards. Thankfully her affluent father provides the supplementary income which her job as well as hapless husband cannot. Yet instead of finding contentment in her win-win situation, Marina carries on an affair with her best friend's husband, and also initiates a bizarre series of erotic encounters with a deadbeat cop who previously raped her.
Despite all the trappings of success and happiness, Marina is caught in the unending misery of corruption, exemplified by the chasing and rape of a prostitute, a negotiated affair with her husband's business partner, and the long stream of children she sees as a social worker. Her life hits rock bottom when she is raped by three policemen and meets with complicity and a callous disregard for justice everywhere she turns for help. When she decides to take matters into her own hands, she realizes she can, in her own way, soften the harshness of this reality.
