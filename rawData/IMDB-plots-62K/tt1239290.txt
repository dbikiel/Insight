What happens when a sexual connection overwhelms all your senses? A woman puts everything on the line in pursuit of a passionate affair with a man she hardly knows.
Karen is a successful Copenhagen-based fashion photographer who is happily married to Johan, a writer. But she works so constantly that she has little time for her husband and daughter. In her dreams, however, she has erotic encounters with an unknown man in an East European hotel room. At a photo shoot in Paris one day, she meets the stranger from her dreams for real: Maciek, a professor at Warsaw School of Economics and visiting from Poland. She feels an electric attraction that changes her life.- and begins an affair. She pursues him relentlessly, even going so far as to follow him all the way to Warsaw and ensconcing herself in an apartment right across the street from the apartment where he lives with his wife and family. Although her husband senses a change in her, Karen keeps meeting him. Her obsession increasingly causes her to lose control. While Maciek initially encourages the romance, he soon tires of Karen and tries to extricate himself from the relationship.
