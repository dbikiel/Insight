A hapless husband neglects to clear the icy walk, which leads to the mailman slipping and breaking his neck. A comedy of errors results from his attempts to hide the body.
Right before leaving for her Judo class at the gym, Alice Phelps tells her husband Ralph to clean off the snow-covered front walk before he leaves for work. Of course, Ralph ignores his wife, and as a result, when he returns home, he finds the body of the regular postman lying on his front stairs, who, obviously, slipped on the ice Ralph neglected to remove. Poor Ralph, what are you going to do when your wife returns?
Alice Phelps heads off to the gym, reminding her husband Ralph to shovel the snow from the porch. Ralph ignores her and then later finds that the mailman has slipped, broken his neck, and died on their snow- and ice-covered porch. Ralph panics, and what he does with the body (because he's in fear of the letter carriers' union) and what Alice does upon returning home forever change their marriage.
