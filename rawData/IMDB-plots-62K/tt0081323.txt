Pepi is raped by the policeman who catches her growing marijuana in her apartment. She seeks revenge by getting his masochist wife to leave him.
Almodovar's first film of life in Madrid during the punk era and not one for the squeamish. He covers everything from drugs and sexual violence, to female masochism.
While playing with her Superman card in her apartment, Pepi is visited by her neighbor and dirty policeman, who saw her vases with a plantation of marijuana on the window, rapes her and she is not arrested. Pepi plots revenge and calls her punk friends, and they mistakenly beat the policeman's twin brother up along the night on the sidewalk of a street. Pepi introduces her punk singer friend Bom to the policeman's masochistic wife Lucinda (Luciana), and when Bom urinates on her face, she falls in love for Bom and leaves her husband. Pepi, Luci and Bom go to underground concerts, bars and parties, but when the policeman meets Luci alone, he beats her up and she returns to him, while Pepi and Bom stay together.
