Boston , the fall of 2008. While the banking crisis grips national news, two young slackers rob a high-stakes poker game. The local Mob attorney brings in Jackie to clean things up. He's a hit man who likes to kill his victims softly. There's a code at work: Jackie surmises that he has to kill Trattman, even though he's innocent; then Jackie brings in Mickey from out of state, because one of the people who has to die knows Jackie. Can Jackie's methodical, cheery approach to his work put the local underground's finances back in order?
Livid over the fact that three low-level thieves have crashed the entire underworld economy, the mob's top brass hires Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt) to see that the bandits pay for their crime. The closer Cogan gets to his target, however, the more he finds his mission complicated by an alcoholic hit man who's well past his prime, incompetent gangsters, and the playboy host of the inauspicious game.
