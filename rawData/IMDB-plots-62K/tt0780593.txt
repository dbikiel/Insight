Residents of a small backwoods community summon the murderous demon of vengeance himself for revenge against a local mortician who wronged their deceased love ones, while a town physician seeks to kill those involved in its summoning.
A small backwoods community has discovered that the local mortician has been cutting corners by dumping the bodies of their loved ones in a nearby swamp as opposed to cremating them as promised. Infuriated by the horrific desecration endured by the dearly departed, the residents of the town seek out a local witch with the power to resurrect the demon of vengeance. As the demon Pumpkinhead rises to claim the lives of all who took part in the abominable scheme, the eccentric town physician who masterminded an illegal organ donor business makes it his mission to murder any and all who played a part in unleashing the murderous monster.
