Outrageous, misogynistic and vulgar-to-the-max comedian Andrew Dice Clay does his stuff in this combination of a stand-up concert video, in a filled-to-capacity performance at Madison Square Gardens, and a series of comedy sketches.
Before he was The Diceman, he was a poor, pathetic, put-upon Jew from New York who was disrespected by everyone he came across. Everyone. Then - he got the studded vanity leather jacket--and the Diceman was just - well, he just appeared. And his coolness and general attitude about everything just blew everyone away. Cut to Madison Square Garden where the Diceman himself not only became cool, suave, arrogant - and strangely Italian. He filled the arena two nights in a row. He comes onto the stage and croons in a Gold-Record worthy Clay original - then he starts the stand-up. And leaves no taboo - taboo. The attack on everything. The need to just blow the lid off of everything the fascism of political correctness has been taking over worse than - well, any Holocaust ever did. And the crowd is always giving him a standing ovation loud and powerful enough to level the house.
