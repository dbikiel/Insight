Released from prison, statutory rapist ex-teacher Deborah Ward seeks revenge on cross-dressing co-worker Richard Martinez who put her there.
Released from prison, ex-teacher Deborah Ward seeks revenge on Richard Martinez, the cross-dressing co-worker who outed her practice of having sex with male students. Hearing of Russia's terrible treatment of homosexuals (far worse than Texans can), she tricks her former colleague to fly there over spring break, hoping he'll get unceremoniously imprisoned for his homosexuality. Complicating matters is Rex, Richard's mind-fried druggie friend, and Deborah's simple-minded daughter, Carly, who wants her deflated fake boobs restored.
