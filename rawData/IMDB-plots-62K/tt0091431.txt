Asian Hawk (Jackie Chan) and his bumbling sidekick are sent on a quest through Europe to find a mysterious treasure held by a shadowy organization of monks.
Jackie Chan plays an ex-singer-turned-fortune-hunter, whose ex-girlfriend is kidnapped by an evil cult. Her fiance, an old friend of Jackie's, turns to him for help - as the kidnappers intended... lots of cooool, Jackie style action and laughs.
