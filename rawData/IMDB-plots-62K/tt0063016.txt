Documentation of 1967 Los Angeles Easter Sunday Love-In.
Against the audio backdrop of the psychedelically charged music of the day with no dialogue, the proceedings of the first ever Los Angeles Love-In on Easter Sunday, 1967, are presented. A large crowd of people of different ages, sexes, races and seemingly social backgrounds have converged on a grassy field. Music abounds - some formally presented on stage, with other impromptu within the crowds - while people groove in their own way to what they hear. They are all there to express and celebrate their freedoms most specifically about love, both individual love and societal love.
