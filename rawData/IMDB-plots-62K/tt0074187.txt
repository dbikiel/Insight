Taking place during the Chilean Coup d'Ã©tat in 1973, this film opens with the attempted military coup of June 1973, which is put down by troops loyal to the government. The left is divided over strategy, while the right methodically lays the groundwork for the military seizure of power. The film's dramatic concluding sequence documents the coup d'etat, including Allende's last radio messages to the people of Chile, footage of the military assault on the presidential palace, and that evening's televised presentation of the new military junta.
