A documentation of the influences that went on to help create the seminal album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
On 1st June, 1967 The Beatles released what would become the world's first concept album, SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND. Described by Rolling Stone magazine as "The most important rock &amp; roll album ever made..." the album not only changed the course of music but went on to become one of the biggest selling records of all time. Featuring interviews with former employees, fellow musicians, family members and journalists, and supported by a vast array of original and exclusive never-seen-before footage, the film offers a fascinating insight into the swinging sixties and the 12 months surrounding the album's release. Examining the band's disillusionment with touring, their changing relationship with manager, Brian Epstein, and the advent of the Summer Of Love, this star-studded rockumentary offers a fascinating insight into the creation and recording of one of the most ground-breaking and influential albums in pop history.
