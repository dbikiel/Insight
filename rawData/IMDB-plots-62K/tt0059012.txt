The career of Shakespeare's Sir John Falstaff as a roistering companion to young Prince Hal, circa 1400 to 1413.
Sir John Falstaff is the hero in this compilation of extracts from Shakespeare's "Henry IV" and other plays, made into a connected story of Falstaff's career as young Prince Hal's drinking companion. The massive Knight roisters with and without the Prince, philosophizes comically, goes to war (in his own fashion), and meets his final disappointment, set in a real-looking late medieval England.
The aging King Henry IV watches disapprovingly as his son Hal (later Henry V) enjoys a rude and irresponsible life under the bloated and decadent Sir John Falstaff. The young Prince dreads the not-too-distant day when he will have to choose between his opposed father figures.
