A "Hitlerjugend" kind of story, set in the Soviet Union during the Second World War, based on a fictitious story from the eponymous book by Vladimir Kunin. The Red Army has a gang of juveniles for a clandestine operation against the Nazis. The boys are trained by a dangerous crime lord at a top secret boot camp. They are doomed to die in the mission, or after it, just to keep it a secret.
Based on a true story of teen criminals in the Soviet Union during World War 2. As alternative to prison they are trained in the mountains of Armenia for a mission in Nazi Germany to blow up an important installation. All but one boy dies. Most die during the rigorous training &amp; some die in Germany. It is still unsure what is exactly true or not according to what faction one speaks with, but surely the fact that at the awards ceremony it was a heated moment amongst believers and non believers that the event ever took place.
The year is 1943. Colonel Vishnevskiy (Andrei Panin) receives an order from the government to train a group of saboteur soldiers who should stop the actions of a German army group called "Edelweiss". The mission is a top-secret one. Vishnevskiy trains young (14-to-15-year-old) boys from juveniles. They all know that after the mission is finished they all will be eliminated since they all know too much to be left alive.
