Agathe Cl√©ry is a hard working and modern marketing manager from a cosmetics company, specialized in clear skin. Her colleagues find her snob, strict, and they know she's a racist. One day though, Agathe is diagnosed to suffer from Addison syndrome, which alters and darkens your skin color. One morning, she wakes up as black as the ones she intensively hated.
