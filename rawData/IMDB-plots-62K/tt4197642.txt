A woman newly released from prison seeks a date to bring to her best friend's wedding.
'Mad' Mary McArdle returns to Drogheda after a short spell in prison - for something she'd rather forget. Back home, everything and everyone has changed. Her best friend, Charlene, is about to get married and Mary is to be her maid of honour. When Charlene refuses Mary a 'plus one' on the grounds that she probably couldn't find a date, Mary becomes determined to prove her wrong. 'A Date for Mad Mary' is a tough and tender story about friendship, first love, and letting go of the glory days.
