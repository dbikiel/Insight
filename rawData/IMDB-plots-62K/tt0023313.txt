On a tropical island, a native boy sings "Pagan Moon" to his sweetheart. Later, he plays music underwater with an octopus-pianist and other jazz-loving sea life.
An islander serenades his sweetheart by the light of the moon. A crocodile swallows the boy's ukulele, but he manages to get it back. The two then go for a boat ride, during which the ukulele is accidentally knocked overboard. The boy dives down to retrieve it and sees all manner of undersea life.
On a tropical island, a native boy sings "Pagan Moon" to his sweetheart. The other natives, the animals, and even the plant life join in the fun. One of the coconut trees dances to the music, slapping its "rear" and twirling two of its coconuts as though they were breasts. The fun is interrupted when an alligator swallows the boy's ukulele. The clever boy holds the reptile's mouth open with a stick, walks down into its stomach and retrieves his instrument. Later, the fun is interrupted yet again when the boy drops the ukulele into the sea. He dives underwater to get it back, and ends up playing music with all the sea life, including a trombone-playing fish and a piano-playing octopus.
