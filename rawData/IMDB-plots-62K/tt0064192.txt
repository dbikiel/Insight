Two crooks are hired to rob an eccentric old lady's estate, but once they get to know her, they can't bring themselves to do it.
Recently paroled convicts Herbie Haseler and Marty Miller realizing they're broke decide to go to New York and work for their old boss Nick Marco.But Nick is tired of these two idiots who bungled the last caper they were hired to do. Therefore, Nick is reluctant to re-hire Herbie and Marty.Besides, the duo still owes ten thousand dollars to Nick for bankrolling the armored car heist that went wrong, sending Herbie and Marty to prison. However, Herbie has been in charge of the prison library and has studied a lot. He convinces his boss to finance one more caper, this time in England, where many rich lords live in opulent mansions. These English mansions house many treasures, including fine art, priceless paintings worth millions, antiquities and more. Although skeptical, New York mob boss Nick Marco reluctantly agrees to send Herbie and Marty to England. For this purpose, he bankrolls the operation and also gets in touch with his mob contacts in the UK. The contact is Frank Finley, the London mob boss who owns most of the London casinos. The target is the large English countryside estate of elderly Lady Sophie Fitzmore who lives with her loyal nephew Freddie Fritzmore. This caper would have to succeed because Herbie and Marty already owe too much money to their New York crime boss who expects results.
