How do you find a murderer amidst the chaos, death and destruction of the Second World War? On the Russian Front in the harsh winter of 1943, a series of bodies, hideously mutilated and carved with bizarre symbols and messages, are discovered. Arturo, a world-weary police inspector, now serving his country in the brutal regime of the military, makes it his personal mission to track down the killer, a cunning, vicious entity seemingly intent on making known a diabolical master plan, one that may lead to the very top of the chain of command, threatening the very direction of the war.
Russian Front, Winter 1943. A battalion of the Blue Division encounters a series of horses' heads scattered on the frozen surface of a lake. The bodies are submerged beneath the ice. Mounted on one of the horses, the body of a Spanish soldier. A pit pierced his neck from side to side, and the shoulder has an inscription to the sword: "Have I not see God." The controls handle the investigation to the soldier Arturo Andrade (Juan Diego Botto), a former police inspector, who takes the job with precision and professionalism. Arthur believes that the murder is related to Masonry. There is also a second hypothesis: that the victim was a pro-Soviet agent infiltrated the Division, and "Have I not see God," a warning to other potential collaborators.Released in Spain: January 20, 2012
