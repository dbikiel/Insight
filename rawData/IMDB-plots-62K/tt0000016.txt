A rowboat with three men is leaving a little harbor. Two of them are rowing the boat, while the third is sitting in the stern. All of them wear hats. They are passing the outer end of a pier, where two women in long, black gowns and aprons are standing together with two little girls. It's windy and the waves are quite high. When the boat passes the pier, a big wave appears, that almost throws the boat back into the harbor.
