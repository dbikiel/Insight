Uncle Rollo finally retires to the house he was brought up in. Lost in thoughts of his lost love, Lark, he does not want to be disturbed in his last days. However, the appearance of his niece and the subsequent romance between her and Lark's nephew causes him to reevaluate his life and offer some advice so the young couple don't make the same mistake he did, all those years ago.
The widowed patriarch of the Dane family adopts a young girl named Larke, whose parents have been killed in a train wreck. This upsets his biological children; Selina, the eldest, and two boys, Roland and Pelham. As the years go by, however, the boys find they like their new "sister" and, as they grow older, they each find themselves in love with the high-spirited, but somewhat manipulative, girl. But each attention and accolade that Larke receives only enflames the jealousy of Selina, who feels Larke is nothing but a parasite, who has usurped Selina's rightful role of both daughter and sister and, eventually, matriarch.
