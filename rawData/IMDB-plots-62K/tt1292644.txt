Both detectives on a sickening murder case struggle with being alone and childless in their 40s. As they investigate the young man found beaten and strangled to death, platonic friends Karine and Herve unravel a love story between Vincent, and Rebecca a high school girl. The teenage lovers quickly plunged into the kind of amour fou the flics fear to chance for themselves. Rebecca is missing, and unknown to her, the boy was a homosexual Internet hustler. The ordinarily blasé male investigator is appalled to find that on-line dating is a world the sexy Karine knows well. Is Rebecca the killer, another victim or ?
Vincent and Rebecca fell in love at first sight, when they first exchanged glances at a cyber-cafe. They are both young, barely eighteen years old, and face the future with few doubts or worries. Two months later, Vincent's body is discovered in the Rhône, and Rebecca has disappeared. Inspector Hervé Cagan and his partner, Karine Mangin, are placed in charge of the investigation. While they put together the clues gleaned by Vincent and Rebecca's brief romance which links their life and death, Hervé and Karine find themselves confronted by the failures in their own lives.
