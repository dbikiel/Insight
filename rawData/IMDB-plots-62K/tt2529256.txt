This is a 3-D movie production of the classic Puccini Opera "Madam Butterfly", directed by world renowned photographer Michel Comte. It's a modern day tale that starts with the young Madame Butterfly emerging from the ashes of the atomic bomb in Nagasaki. By a subtle meshing of reality and fantasy, Michel Comte and his team bring to the screen a visual orgy of modern ballet, opera, and narrative filmmaking.
