Wilbur Whateley travels to the Arkham Miskatonic University to borrow the legendary Necronomicon. But, little does anyone know, Whateley isn't quite human...
H.P. Lovecraft meets Hollywood: Wilbur Whateley wants to help the Old Ones break through by consulting the Necronomicon, and Armitage must stop him.
Dr. Henry Armitage, Sandra Dee and another girl who wasn't in the book visit the library of the Miskatonic University where they are studying, and find a mysterious young man named Wilbur Whateley trying to borrow the Necronomicon (to non-HPL fans : a book containing ancient rites to bring alien gods to our planet), and as it is a public library they let him. Sandra Dee offers to drive the moustachioed warlock back to his home in Dunwich, where he drugs her and makes her stay to be a part in his evil ceremonies.
Dean Stockwell delivers a creepy, sexually suggestive performance as Wilbur Wotley. This film proves that Lovecraft can indeed be portrayed in film where so many have failed miserably. I look to Guillermo Deltorro to carry on the tradition!
