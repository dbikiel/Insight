In this darkly karmic vision of Arizona, a man who breathes nothing but ill will begins a noxious domino effect as quickly as an uncontrollable virus kills. As he exits Arizona State Penn after twenty-one long years, Wilson has only one thing on the brain, leveling the score with career criminal, Mackey Willis. As eccentric and intuitive as he is vicious, Mackey's own perfected criminal game will play right into the path Wilson has set for him. With the help of a prison bus driver, Lee Marvin, Wilson acts as a catalyst, putting a plan into action that will bring an untimely end to Mackey Willis. The problem is, no plan is perfect. Meanwhile, an aimless bunch of Arizona twenty-nothings are cooking up a heist that will lead them to the same bank, with different intentions. Skilled at nothing beyond drinking, doing drugs and attending strip clubs, their plan is destined for immediate failure. Heavily armed, without a single identifiable clue, these boys are as blind as they are impulsive. With both plans loosely angled inward, the vengefully mystical presence of the Sonoran landscape will have its way and every solider will fall on his own sword.
In Arizona, after twenty-one years in prison, Wilson is released at the same time as Lee Marvin and while driving back home, they have a conversation about their future plans. Lee is absolutely regenerated while Wilson plots revenge against the despicable criminal Mackey, who framed him and was the responsible for his conviction. Wilson invites Lee and Mackey to heist a bank and raise money. Meanwhile, a group of young smalltime crooks plan the heist of the same bank to raise money for drugs, booze and women, and the clumsy Connor becomes a serious threat for his friends with his shotgun.
