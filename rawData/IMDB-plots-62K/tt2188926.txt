High-school music teacher Beth Landon puts herself on the line when she invites world-famous country singer Jason Keith to perform at her rural town's Strawberry Festival. A one-hit wonder with a horrible rep for canceling shows and copping an attitude, Jason isn't what Beth's mother Eileen considers a reliable musical act for the beloved festival, which she is proudly hosting with her good friend Ruth. Reigning Strawberry Queen Beth attempts to stick up for her favorite singer, but when she finally meets Jason face-to-face, this becomes difficult. But behind Jason's rock-star image is the secret he's keeping about his past that could turn his tanking career around. Beth helps his manager Ray convince him that the festival gig is a great way to revitalize his career and win back his audience. As Jason spends more time with Beth, his attitude fades as they encourage each other to realize their deepest dreams as talented musicians.
