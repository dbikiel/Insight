Two cousins and friends, Richie and Evan, go to Atlantic City to gamble. Richie loses all he has at slot machines and asks Evan for two more coins for a last attempt. That last attempt brings a $400,000 jackpot for Richie. No wonder Evan turns greedy and jealous.
SOUR GRAPES is what you get when lots of money ignites a runaway chain of events including deceit, destruction and dissolution all because two cousins can't figure out how to share 50 cents. Richie, a sneaker sole designer, and his cousin Evan, a brain surgeon, are spending this weekend with their girlfriends in Atlantic City. Having exhausted their gambling funds, Richie drops his last quarter into a slot machine. Evan advises him that he needs two more quarters to really make it big and proceeds to give him the extra coins. Richie pulls the lever. Moments later, three grapes across, Richie is scooping up a $436,000 jackpot. Does Evan get two-thirds of the payoff for two-thirds of the investment? Not in Richi's eyes. How about half? No dice.
Richie, a sneaker sole designer, and his cousin Evan, a brain surgeon, are spending this weekend with their girlfriends in Atlantic City. When one of them ends up with a $436,000 jackpot, sour grapes is what results. Even though Richie uses two quarters from Evan to win the progressive jackpot, he sees no connection with that and sharing the jackpot. This ignites a hilarious, runaway chain of events including deceit, destruction and dissolution in the family as everyone seems to side strongly with one side or the other.
