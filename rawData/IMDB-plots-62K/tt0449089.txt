Bob Munro and his dysfunctional family rent an RV for a road trip to the Colorado Rockies, where they ultimately have to contend with a bizarre community of campers.
The executive Bob Munro is stressed, feeling threatened of losing his job and his lifestyle, since his abusive boss Todd Mallory hired the Stanford's geek Laird to work in their soda's company. Bob has promised his wife Jamie Munro, his teenage daughter Cassie Munro and his young son Carl Munro to spend vacations in Hawaii, but Todd demands him to prepare a presentation and attend a business meeting with the owners of a family company in a merging operation scheduled in the same period. Bob hides the truth to his family, rents a recreational vehicle and tries to convince his dysfunctional family that a road trip to the Colorado Rocky Mountains would be good to bring old values back to their family. After many incidents and while in the trailers parking area, the rookie Bob is helped by the bizarre but friendly Gornicke family. They escape from the Gornickes and initiate a journey of difficulties and leaning, retrieving their forgotten family bonds.
Bob Munro is the dad of a dysfunctional family. He hires an RV to take the family on vacation. However Bob is NOT the best RV steering wheel operator in the neighborhood and the hilarity is added on by the fact that the brakes are about as useful as a chocolate fireguard. Bob first realizes it when the RV rolls (not literally) backwards into a line of shopping carts. Also Bob's job is in danger if he doesn't go to a very important meeting. Before you can say "COME BACK! COME BACK!," things go gloriously, hilariously, Munro-annoyingly wrong due to the lack of brakes, Bob's job, toilet waste not cleared out from the last rental and more hilarious stuff.
