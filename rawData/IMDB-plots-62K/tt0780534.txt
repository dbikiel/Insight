Henry Durand is a young federal agent who is given a difficult assignment: spy on his mother and her boyfriend who is suspected of leading a gang of art thieves.
Henry is a young FBI agent. During a three-year absence from his home in Shreveport, his mother Marty loses more than 100 pounds, looks great, and to Henry's embarrassment, has become a party animal. Within a day of Henry's returning home with his fianc√©e, Emily, who's an FBI profiler, Marty meets Tommy, a suave foreigner. He's posing as a consultant, but he's an international art thief, in town to steal "Mother and Son," a Bernini sculpture. Henry is detailed to head a team keeping his mom's new boyfriend under surveillance. Love, law enforcement, and filial devotion are set to collide.
Single, low-ranking FBI agent Henry Durand, engaged to profiler Emily Lott, moves back to the parental home in Shreveport with his widowed mother Marty, who to his distaste turned into a cougar party animal. Henry has his doubts from the start about mother's latest admirer, slick gentleman Tommy Lucero, even before the FBI swears him to secrecy but promises a promotion if he pulls off an unorthodox undercover operation: spying o the couple, without telling his loved-ones, as Tommy is an international master jewelry thief. Indeed he already constituted a team of mutually suspicious crooks, and has a master plan.to steal Bernini's sculpture "Mother and Son", on loans to the city museum for a prestigious exposition, and it includes dodging guards as well as Henry's FBI team, plus a major twist.
