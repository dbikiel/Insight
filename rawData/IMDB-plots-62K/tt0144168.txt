Two girls wander away from a White House tour and meet President Nixon.
Comedy about two high school girls who wander off during a class trip to the White House and meet President Richard Nixon. They become the official dog walkers for Nixon's dog Checkers, and become his secret advisors during the Watergate scandal.
When Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein broke the story that Richard Nixon knew about the attempt to bug the Democratic headquarters in Watergate, they identified their source only as Deep Throat. This film theorizes that Deep Throat was Betsy and Arlene, two ditzy teenage girls who witness G. Gordon Liddy's prescence in the hotel during the bugging. To keep them quiet, Nixon hires them as "official White House dog walkers," then "Presidential youth advisors." However, when they learn the truth about what is going on they take their story to Woodward and Bernstein. Nixon attempts all kinds of measures to stop them. He was tricky, they were better.
