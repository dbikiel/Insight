From Earth's pollution a new monster is spawned. Hedorah, the smog monster, destroys Japan and fights Godzilla while spewing his poisonous gas to further the damage.
Coming to Earth on a fallen meteorite, The microscopic alien life-form Hedorah feeds on Earth's pollution and grows into a Gigantic, ever Evolving, poisonous Gas and acid-secreting monster. Godzilla, Earth's Defender senses the Threat and Meets ''the Smog Monster'' in a Literal, Battle for Earth's Survival.
A pollution monster named Hedorah comes from outer space. First it terrorizes sea, then it goes on land where it encounters the big G. After it's after the fight with Godzilla it retreats, only to reappear again in a flying form, it's starts to kill people. Then it takes on it's final form, that's when the Big G comes and the battle that decides the fate of the world begins.
By this time, Gojira, defender of the Earth, has become a national phenomenon, akin to the Loch Ness Monster, especially with children, ingrained into the Japanese conciousness. However, the Japanese people still don't realize that destroying the earth will summon the millennias-old protector. A young boy finds a dangerous monster that thrives on toxic waste that he names Hedorâ, a pun on the Japanese word for sludge, "hedoro." In his dreams, he wishes for Gojira to defeat Hedorâ and, hopefully, persuade people to stop polluting the earth. Gojira, coincidentally, fights the monster because of the destruction to the environment.
