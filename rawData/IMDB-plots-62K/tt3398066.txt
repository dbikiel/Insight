A marketing executive tries to find Mr. Right on a Christian dating website. When impressing her dream guy ends in disaster, Gwyneth gets in touch with her spiritual side.
Gwyneth Hayden has it all. A top-notch career, killer wardrobe, dream apartment, and great friends - she thinks the only thing missing is a man. In a moment of inspired desperation, she fills out a profile on the dating website ChristianMingle.com hoping to find Mr. Right. However, Gwyneth's Christianity is a little rusty and her attempts at impressing her dream guy end in disaster when he calls her out on her "faux faith." In an honest realization, she sees her superficial life for what it really is, and is driven to create a personal relationship with God.
Ambitious 30-something marketing executive Gwyneth Hayden logs onto ChristianMingle.com in search of her ideal man, but gets called out for religious hypocrisy on a big date. The event serves as an epiphany for Gwyneth, who subsequently makes it her life mission to establish a meaningful relationship with God.
