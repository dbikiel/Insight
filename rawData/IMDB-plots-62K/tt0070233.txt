An ordinary Soviet building manager, living in the 20th century, is extremely similar to a Tsar of All Rus' - Ivan IV the Terrible (1530-1584). He would never have known about this, but one day his neighbor created a time machine.
Shurik Timofeev builds a working model of a time machine. By accident, Ivan Bunsha, an apartment complex manager, and George Miloslavsky, a petty burglar, are transferred to the 16th century Moscow, while Tsar Ivan the Terrible goes into the year 1973.
The film begins as black and white. Inventor Aleksandr Sergeevich Timofeev (aka Shurik) creates a time machine. Another experiment to launch it, periodically leading to burnout of traffic jams in the entrance, ended in an explosion, burnout of traffic jams in the whole house and loss of consciousness by Shurik. With the beginning of Shurik's dream, the film becomes color.
