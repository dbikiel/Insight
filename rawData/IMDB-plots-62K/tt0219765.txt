A voyage through writing, sex, spirituality, nightmares, and New York that captures the warmth and high animal spirits of singular American artist and auteur, Henry Miller, on an intimate tour of his bathroom gallery. It's a miraculous shrine of photos, drawings, and interstitial anecdotes of mad kings, philosophers, women, and friends of the author.
