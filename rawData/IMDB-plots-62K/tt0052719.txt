Phil, a part-time truck driver and singer who wears his pants far too high, meets a feisty platinum blonde who challenges him to a drag race through Griffith Park. When he is caught and loses his license, he meets up with the sketchy Frank Wooster who offers him a job singing in his new nightclub. When Phil discovers that his new job also includes drug running, he must fight to save his friends and himself.
One of a kind - the only J-D film in which the hero is an accordion player: Truck driver Phil is forced off the road by playgirl---heavy on the play---Jana Ryan in her sports car. Later, she sees him singing in a club as "Daddy-O." He tells her she is the world's worst driver, and she challenges him to a race. They roar through the park side-by-side (in two vehicles it must be added)until apprehended by the police. A really bright gang recognizes Phil's great driving ability---(hey, he was side by side with Jana through the park)--- and they recruit him to be the driver of their really, really souped-up getaway car, although it does not have the Getaway logo on their car. Unknown to Jana, Phil is working WITH the police, and she tries to get him away from the gangsters, but she is captured by them. Phil overpowers the gang-leader (without having to resort to playing his accordion) and the rest are jailed, and he promises Jana he will give up driving for singing.
