Parisian friends (two brothers and their one-time girl friends) fly to Corsica for a mountain trek guided by the married lover of one of the women. Cora, nearly 30, goes because her psychic says she'll meet a man with a load on his shoulders, which she guesses is a backpack. Nadine goes to be with her lover, Eric, the trek's guide, who is married but promises to leave his wife and daughters soon. Brothers Louis and Mathieu go because Nadine has promised that the beautiful Bernadette will accompany them, plus Louis wants a break from his possessive lover, Jennifer. Bernadette doesn't show; Eric proves a temperamental guide; and, by the end, some relationships change.
