A housewife with an abusive husband has an affair with a writer.
Tina Balser is a bored New York housewife-mother married to Jonathan, a pompous, social-climbing lawyer who ridicules her in front of their children, criticizing everything she does or wears. She begins an affair with George Prager, a dashing, successful and blatantly sadistic writer. Finally after George has tormented Tina in much the same manner Jonathan has, and has been unfaithful to boot, she goes back to her husband and begins group therapy.
Diary of a Mad Housewife is set in the early 1970s New York, at a time when the role of women as worker/wife was unclear. The Women's Liberation Movement hasn't hit Bettina, however, who is deftly played by Carrie Snodgrass. A housewife whose idealistic lawyer husband has turned in to a materialistic social climber, Bettina finds herself on the verge of a nervous breakdown after a summer in the Hamptons. She struggles with her role as mother-housekeeper-wife as her husband becomes more demanding and distant, and she is constantly reminded of her 'duties' as a wife and mother. At yet another party with the mad social whirl of New York, Bettina meets George Prager, a writer whose ego is as large as Bettina's anxiety. As she works through a sexual affair with Prager, who is as verbally abusive as her husband, Bettina slowly begins to realize that she has allowed herself to be a pawn from both her lover and her husband. As her husband's facade begins to crack, she slowly gains strength and realizes that it is she that must carry the family; humor the husband so he feels better, raise her daughters to be ladies, batten down the hatches, and make things right. Bettina is a classic example of a woman searching for her identity, lost in the chorus of how 'lucky ' she is.
