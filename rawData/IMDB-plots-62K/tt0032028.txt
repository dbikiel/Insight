D'Artagnan sings and fronts for slapstick cowardly Ritz brothers posing as musketeers.
A parodic remake of the story of the young Gascon D'Artagnan, who arrives in Paris, his heart set on joining the king's Musketeers. He is taken under the wings of three of the most respected and feared Musketeers, Porthos, Aramis, and Athos. Together they fight to save France and the honor of a lady from the machinations of the powerful Cardinal Richelieu.
Not quite. Parody, yes; remake, no. Read reviews below.
