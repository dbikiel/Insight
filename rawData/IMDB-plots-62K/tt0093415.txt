A pair of siblings must choose whether to pursue their dream of touring with their rock band or support their family and stay in Cleveland, Ohio.
The siblings Patti and Joe Rasnick live in an industrial suburb in Cleveland, Ohio, and play in a local rock band, The Barbusters. While Patti is focused on their rock band, Joe is also devoted to the family and the upbringing of Patti's young son, Benji. Their pious mother reproaches them for their way of life, especially when they quit their jobs and go on tour, taking Benji with them. In the steamy, smoke-filled clubs in and around Cleveland, they find their happiness living the dream with The Barbusters. Patti and Joe live their lives for one hour in the spotlight on stage, and when the lights go down, their world lights up. With hard times in the family and hard knocks on the job, it's hard rock music at night that keeps them alive.
