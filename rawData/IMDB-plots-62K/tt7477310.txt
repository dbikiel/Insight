Stephan (Christoph Maria Herbst) and his wife Elisabeth (Caroline Peters) organize a dinner in their house in Bonn. Invited are family friend René (Justus von Dohnányi), Thomas (Florian David Fitz) and his pregnant girlfriend Anna (Janina Uhse). But the parents of an unborn boy make sure that the evening planned as a cozy get-together suddenly gets out of hand: they announce that they want to call their child Adolf and thus cause a scandal.
