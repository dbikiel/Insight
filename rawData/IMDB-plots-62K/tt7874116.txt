In the running for a promotion, reality cooking show producer Kelly prepares for her cooking show for kids. When show host Chef Betty has an unexpected injury, Kelly hires controversial Chef Stephen as a replacement.
Hardworking and optimistic television producer, Kelly (Ali Liebert), doesn't have time for love. Along with her mentor Amanda (Janet Kidder), Kelly dives into another season of the Little Gourmet, a kids cooking show, when hot-headed chef Stephen Harris (Brett Dalton) is dropped into Kelly's life as a last minute replacement host. As the two struggle to make peace and a successful show, they realize they have a lot more in common than they thought - a love of food, the kids they encounter and each other.
Hot-headed, perfectionist, innovative chef Stephen Harris was discredited by an Internet incident. When the old-fashioned resident chef of kids cooking competition Little Gourmet is medically disabled last-minute, the network decides to pimp its ratings by bringing in the controversial cook. He accepts, but doesn't consider taking brainless orders from the show's culinary ignoramus producer Kelly, nor settling for less the stars restaurant conditions, nor even lowering his standards to kids level. She despairs as he does everything his gastronomically right way, and scores, while an improbably romance grows , mainly trough her stomach and disarming kid candidates.
