984 IS A MAN WITHOUT A NAME. WITHOUT HOPE. WITHOUT A FUTURE AND WITH ONLY ROBOTS TO HEAR HIS SCREAMS.He was imprisoned without a trial and without a reason. His identity was taken from him. He was tortured and beaten, though innocent. His screams fell on deaf ears.These are the realities of tomorrow; a nightmare glimpse of a horrifying, electronic future without human rhyme or reason. There is no escape. There may be no reason to escape.
