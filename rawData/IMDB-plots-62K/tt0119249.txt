A nuclear armed SS20 will be smuggled from Russia via Finland to Sweden unless Swedish agent Hamilton +5 stop them with "no loose ends". What about the other stolen SS20?
Swedish agent Carl Hamilton and Finnish Åke Stålhandske are ordered to stop Russian smugglers. The smuggled goods is a nuclear missile. It's an SS 20, 1,5 megatons, "enough to turn Paris, Washington or New York to ashes". The American villain is Mike Hawkins.
