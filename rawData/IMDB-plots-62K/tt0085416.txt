Pre-medical student Glen Marshall (Rick Barnes) falls head-over-heels for Gretta (Meridith Haze), a blue-movie actress who plays piano at a tawdry night club. Gretta leads Glen into a nether-world of bizarre characters, including a group of rich patrons whose desires are not only quirky but dangerous. Bored and jaded by all of life's sensualities, they play their own imaginative versions of Russian roulette, seeking their final rush of adrenaline...death! Glen rebuffs the group at the first suicide game he attends. Gretta overdoses. Grieved, Glen attends her funeral. Nights later, he discovers Gretta is not dead but has become piano-player "Charlie White." Glen's obsession to restore Gretta to the woman he cherished incites the sinister circle to take them captives for the ultimate chilling and killing charade.
