2 brothers try to make it in the comedy business. The kid brother "Foolish"/Eddie Griffin does a lot of stand-up comedy.
Eddie Griffin is Miles Waise, a fast rising nightclub comedian. His life is made difficult by his manager, who wants him to sell out for big bucks, and his brother Fifty Dollah, a scheming hood whose dream is to start a comedy club with Foolish.
