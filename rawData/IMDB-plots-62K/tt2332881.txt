"Somewhere in Palilula" tells the story of Serafim, a fresh graduate of a medical school, in 60's Romania. He is brought by destiny to the strange town of Palilula. Nowhere, that is. Palilula is a ghost town, lost in the middle of the Wallachia. A quarantine area, a sanatorium, an improbable hospital, a gynecological clinic in a settlement where no child is born. A small community of fools, lazies, sluts, vagabonds with angel's hearts is living under the sun in a sweet innocent unconsciousness. A community of Romanians who forgot their language, but not the nostalgia of their traditional music. Romanians with Danubian taste and disorientation. The young doctor Serafim will not get to practice his profession in this childless town. He will be drowning in the sweet and poisoned honey of the place, like a fly caught by a frog.
