On their release from prison, two criminals join forces to prove the innocence of a wrongfully convicted fellow prisoner and in the process, also learn the truth about their own missing parents.
Raja (Rajinikanth) and Babu (Prabhu) are two friends and petty criminals. They meet an innocent man Manohar (Pandiyan) who tells them that his sister was raped by Muthuraaj (Radha Ravi) and who had killed a taxi driver (witness) with the help of a corrupt police officer Nallasivam (Vinu Chakravarthy) and pinned the murder on Manohar. Manohar is sentenced to death row for the killing by the court. Raja and Babu believe in Manohar's story and decide to find the truth and prove his innocence once they get released from prison. Raja fractures Manohar's arm so that his death sentence would be delayed, until it heals, under law. Once released, Raja and Babu set in motion an elaborate plan to convict the real killers.
