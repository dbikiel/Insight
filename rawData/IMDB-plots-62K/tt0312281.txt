Sara, a straight arrow schoolteacher, meets Virgil, an easygoing tattoo artist, and finds herself choosing between her comfortable life and a life of freedom and adventure.
Sara is a "straight arrow", no nonsense school teacher who has earned the respect of her family, friends, colleagues and community. She frowns on anything that is deviant, until she meets Virgil, a tatoo artist who prefers watching romantic movies to sleeping around. As their friendship turns to romance, Sara finds herself questioning her life's decisions, including her future with her fiance, Brett, and whether she should continue her current life or break free from her bonds to find her true self.
