Two streetwise cops bust criminals in their red and white Ford Gran Torino, with the help of a police snitch called "Huggy Bear".
Set in the 1970s in a metropolis called "Bay City," this is the tale of two police detective partners, Ken "Hutch" Hutchinson, and Dave Starsky, who always seem to get the toughest cases from their boss, Captain Dobey, rely on omniscient street informer Huggy Bear and race to the scene of the crimes in their souped-up 1974 Ford Torino hot rod, telling the story of their first big case (as a prequel to the TV show), which involved a former college campus drug dealer who went on to become a white collar criminal.
It's 1975, we witness the birth of the partnership of undercover cops Starsky and Hutch. One is uptight and by-the-book, the butt of hazing by other officers; he runs through a dozen partners in two years. The other steals from bookies and hangs out with low-lifes. Bad-guy Reese Feldman is importing an odorless, tasteless cocaine that fools drug-sniffing dogs. One of his murder victims washes up on shore about the time Hutch's informants tell him a big cocaine deal is going down. But, our fearless duo moves too quickly, and they are suspended from the force; the partnership founders amid bad feeling. Can they patch it up, don disguises, and ferret out where the murderer hid the coke?
This movie is a remake of the 1970s TV series with detective partners Dave Starsky (Ben Stiller) and Ken 'Hutch' Hutchinson (Owen Wilson) working undercover in Bay City, California. Their savvy and well dressed street informant, Huggy Bear (Snoop Dogg) gives Starsky &amp; Hutch information about a big drug deal that is about to go down. Reese Feldman (Vince Vaughn) is the drug dealer who is about to make millions in the biggest drug deal of his life. Reese is not going to let two cops take him down without a fight. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy)
