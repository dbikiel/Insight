A history of the James Bond franchise.
Of all of pop culture's mainstays, no media property created after the Golden Age of Hollywood has had more influence and staying power than the James Bond franchise. This film covers the story of that creation from the imagination of Ian Fleming seeking an escape from his boring intelligence job. From that literary success, we follow the creation of the film series under the producer team of Broccoli &amp; Saltzman as it became a media sensation in the 1960s. As the franchise dealt with changing actors, legal conflict with writer Kevin McClory and the growing internal schisms with the producers, it has its greatest challenge: the changing times. Despite this, Bond has proven as incredible adapting to them as his adventures as the greatest of the spies.

Everything Or Nothing focuses on three men with a shared dream Bond producers Albert R. Broccoli, Harry Saltzman and author Ian Fleming. Its the thrilling and inspiring narrative behind the longest running film franchise in cinema history which began in 1962. With unprecedented access both to the key players involved and to Eon Productions extensive archive, this is the first time the inside story of the franchise has ever been told on screen in this way. Director Stevan Riley follows a story that begins with a ground-breaking spy thriller and continues six Bonds and five decades later. While Bond was saving the world from chaos and catastrophe on screen, this compelling documentary draws back the curtain to reveal the battles, threats and real stakes unfolding behind the camera.
