Gerald Otley, wannabe antiques dealer, is kicked out of his flat for failing to pay rent, sleeps at a friend's house for the night, wakes up two days later in an airport field, and finds himself entangled in international espionage.
Gerald Arthur Otley (Sir Tom Courtenay), a petty thief and garbage rummager, wakes up one morning after a drunken night on the town, and finds that he is wanted by the Police for murder, and that is only the beginning. While being pursued for a crime he did not commit, he is kidnapped by a group of criminals who suspect him of being involved with double Agents. Otley manages to escape, but cannot avoid getting into one nearly fatal crisis after another, as Police and foreign Agents chase after him. It is a wild week of misadventures which he will never forget.
