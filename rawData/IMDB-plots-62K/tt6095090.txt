The unusual practice of photographing dead relatives during mid-1800s rural Russia will link a Philology student with her husband's abysmal family history.
Nastya is a young woman who travels with her soon to be husband to his family home. Upon their arrival, she can't help but think that the visit may have been a horrible mistake. She is surrounded by strange people and starts witnessing strange, terrible visions as his family prepares her for a mysterious traditional Slavic wedding ceremony. More than the wedding preparations, can she survive the next few days?
In the mid-1800s rural Russia, with his bride Olga only dead for several hours, a newlywed young photographer profoundly scarred by the endless suffering caused by this great loss, decides to resort to an unholy amalgam of science and witchcraft to perform an abominable ritual that would bring his beloved wife back from the realm of the dead inside a fresh and unspoilt new body. Centuries later, Efremov's Philology student Nastya with her newlywed husband Vanya who comes from a family of photographers, pay a visit to his relatives to have a wedding ceremony according to a family tradition. Instead, troubling and unwelcome manifestations fueled by the bleak and grim surroundings begin to plague poor Nastya, becoming all the more evident that she made indeed a wrong decision. As the dreadful visions grow stronger and abnormally clear, so the body weakens, and with Vanya nowhere to be found it is up to Nastya to solve the riddle that stems from the family's abysmal history. Nevertheless, will she live to see another day?
