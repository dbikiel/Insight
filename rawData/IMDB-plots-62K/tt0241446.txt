Two men practicing fencing. Directed by William Dickson and filmed at Thomas Edison's Laboratories in New Jersey. It was an experimental film to test the new kinetoscope. Originally only a second long, this version has been looped and progressively slowed down from a normal starting speed to an 8x slow speed.
