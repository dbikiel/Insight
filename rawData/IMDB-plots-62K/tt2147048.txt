A solipsistic filmmaker takes his independent film on tour. Hoping to escape the pain of his recent breakup, he stumbles into a twisting constellation of fear, sex, and tortured illumination. A tragicomedy about death and marriage, RED FLAG unfurls across six sates, four broken souls, and one very elusive bird.
