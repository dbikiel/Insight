Based on a true story. In 1915, a mountain village in Japan was attacked by a giant bear, dubbed "Red Spot", who terrorized the villagers for days, murdering the men and carrying off the women to save for a late night meal. Sonny Chiba (`Kill Bill`), in his directorial debut, and special advisor Kinji Fukasaku ("Battle Royale") present a film based on this terrifying real life incident.
