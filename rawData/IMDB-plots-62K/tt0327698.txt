The Stevens think that they've won an all-expenses-paid trip to an island that's halfway around the world. When their house is destroyed, their food stolen, and their bacon eaten, the Stevens family breaks apart in front of all their friends on live national television, while the island itself is only a short distance away from Sacramento!
The Stevens win a dream vacation to an island in the middle of the Pacific. Little do they know that they will be stranded for one week on the island with some unfriendly residents, who turn out to be actors in a reality program, with the Stevens as their unfortunate dupes!
