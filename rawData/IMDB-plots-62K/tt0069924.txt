A nutty antiques dealer starts to sacrifice women to an African idol.
Jack Palance plays as a demented art dealer &amp; antique-shop owner who performs nightly rituals in honor of the African god Chuku, whom he believes will reward him with unimaginable wealth and power if he merely offers up human sacrifice. His methods are fairly creative, ranging from impalement, slashing and burning, to scaring people to death with an ooga-booga fright mask.
