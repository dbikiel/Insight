Finding themselves at a crossroads in their tumultuous lives, the members of a daftly dysfunctional family struggle to sort out their hopes, fears and expectations.
All the members of the De Roover family have ended up at a point of no return in their lives where crucial choices have to be made. Winnie wants a child. Her husband Rutmer wants to get in touch with his feelings. His brother Charlie doesn't want any responsibilities. Their brother-in-law Dick wants his deceased wife back. Head of the family Arend wants to be happy. Mother Jeannette wants somebody to want her.
