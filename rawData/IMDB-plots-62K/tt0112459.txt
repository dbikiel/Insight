When Badal attends college, he meets with pretty and percocious, Tina Oberoi (Twinkle Khanna), and after a few misunderstanding and misadventures, both fall in love. This is not taken well by Tina's dad, (Raj Babbar), who hopes to marry Tina with his friend's (Bharat Kapoor) son. Tina's dad complains to the college principal (Vijay Kashyap), but Tina testifies in favour of Badal. Tina's dad then asks a corrupt cop, Neghi, who is the city's Assistant Commissioner of Police, for assistance. Neghi arrests Badal on trumped up charges and imprisons him. Badal's dad (Mukesh Khanna) also comes to the big city to try and make sense of why Badal ended up in prison. Tina's dad gives a contract to Neghi to have Badal killed, to which Neghi agrees and hires a gang of ruthless outlaws to hunt and kill Badal. He also pressurizes Tina not to acknowledge and meet Badal anymore, and Tina reluctantly agrees. Will Badal survive? Will Tina and Badal's love be fated to end tragically?
