A girl's bright smile masks a psychopathic soul that will eliminate anyone who comes between her and her doting father.
After a difficult school year, Jody's teacher, Ms. Hemp, informs her that she'll recommend that Jody's father send her to a special boarding school the next year. Horrified at the thought of being separated from her beloved father, Jody sneaks into school the next day when nobody's there but Ms. Hemp and brutally murders her by crushing her with a bookcase. As other people come between Jody and her father, they meet similar fates.
