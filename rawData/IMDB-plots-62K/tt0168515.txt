Bittersweet Motel is a documentary about the popular rock band Phish. The film focuses on Phish's music, with little emphasis on their die-hard fan base.
This film follows the band, Phish, through a year of its life; from the Great Went concert in Limestone, ME in August 1997 through the subsequent touring in the next year, leading up to August 1998. The director, Todd Phillips, said, "We weren't looking to make 'Tie-Dyed'; I wanted to concentrate on the music."
