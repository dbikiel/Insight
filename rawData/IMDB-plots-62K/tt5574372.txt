The story of two best friends whose dreams of success and stardom have fizzled, so they decide to become famous in one day - at all costs.
NERDLAND is the story of two best friends, aspiring screenwriter ELLIOT and aspiring actor JOHN, whose dreams of super-stardom have fizzled. With their 30th birthdays looming and their desperation growing, John and Elliot decide that in this 24/7, celebrity-obsessed world of over-shared navel-gazing, there are more ways to become famous -- or infamous -- then ever before. So why not become famous TODAY? NERDLAND is that day. Making up for what they lack in brains and talent with abundant, witless enthusiasm, John and Elliot troll Los Angeles on a fame-grab journey, encountering and abusing friends both new and old. Navigating their hyper-stimulating landscape of consumerism gone wild, our two consumers want desperately to be consumed -- and they will have their FAME, no matter what the cost.
