Apollo 13 was supposed to be the third human spacecraft to successfully land on the moon and return home safely, when, 250,000 miles from earth, these words pierced the vastness of space: "Houston, we have a problem." This documentary uses interviews with the actual astronauts, family members and NASA engineers that were there, combined with archival news footage, to tell the true story of Apollo 13.
