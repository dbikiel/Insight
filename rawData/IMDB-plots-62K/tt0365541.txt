A day in the life of the city and citizens of New York as seen through the fantastic eye, and the incredibly distorted optic lenses, of filmmaker Francis Thompson.
A nearly-wordless collage that follows a day in New York City from early morning to late at night. The day starts with a look at power generators, ready to light the city. At eight, an alarm clock goes off, people go to work on the subway, type, and break for lunch. In the evening, night clubs and jazz take over. The images are fanciful, abstract, and multiple, suggesting a kaleidoscope of color and activity. The soundtrack is light, breezy, and staccato. New York City is a place of bridges, skyscrapers, and motion.
