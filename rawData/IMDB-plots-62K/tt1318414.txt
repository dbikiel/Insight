Continuing adventures of little Fyodor and his talking cat friend.
Sharik and Matroskin quarreled and stopped talking to each other because Sharik, instead of felt boots, bought himself trendy sneakers. To carry the communication helps them the postman Pechkin, who transmits telegrams from one end of the hut to the other. Uncle Fyodor and Dad come to Prostokvashino on New Year's Eve (without mom, because mom should sing on the New Year's Blue Light).
