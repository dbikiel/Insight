The cast and crew of all four Psycho films recall their time working on the influential horror series as today's masters of horror reminisce on what the movies stirred in them.
This documentary is a collection of interviews with various producers, actors and directors connected with the Psycho franchise. All give appropriate credit to the original Psycho (1960) for setting the stage of modern slasher films, with only limited information on other aspects of film's originality. Most of the documentary is spent discussing the three subsequent sequels, which produced diminishing returns with respect to quality.
