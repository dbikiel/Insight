The entire squad of gendarmes from Saint-Tropez has been retired. But there is no such power that could stop them from protecting the law and public order.
The whole clique of Cruchot's police station is retired. Now he lives with his rich wife in her castle - and is bored almost to death. He fights with the butler, because he isn't even allowed to do the simple works. But when one of the clique suffers from amnesia after an accident, all of the others reunite and kidnap him, to take him on a tour to their old working places and through their memories. In their old uniforms they turn St. Tropez upside down.
Now maréchal des logis-chef (chief petty officer) Ludovic Cruchot has married the rich colonel's widow Josépha and been retired early from the gendarmerie (French paramilitary police) with his whole St. Tropez (a fancy French Rivièra resort) unit, he finds life as a castle lord unsatisfactorily boring. When his former chief adjudant (warrant officer) Jérôme Gerber and report their mate maréchal des logis (petty officer) Lucien Fougasse is in therapy at La Pinsonnière from amnesia, the veterans all take him on a trip down memory lane, in -now illegal- uniform, only to discover he fakes it to enjoy easy life in the mental asylum. Nevertheless they can't resist sabotaging their much younger successors' promising attempt -by parachute- to catch their favorite pray, the elusive illegal nudists, but find Cruchot's car was stolen, so they masquerade as hippies to penetrate the colony 'undercover' and retrieve it. Everything seems lost with the new commander opening the hunt and both veteran wives deciding to have their own fun, when the 'flying nuns' turn up, whose convent now runs a holiday camp for boys, the five worst scamps being missing for a day, as soon turns out with a most dangerous prank plan...
