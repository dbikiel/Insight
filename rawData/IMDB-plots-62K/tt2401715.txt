19th Century violinist and composer Niccolò Paganini incurs the wrath of his diabolical manager while preparing for his debut performance in London, and falling for the daughter of an English impresario.
1830. Violin virtuoso and notorious womanizer Niccolò Paganini (David Garrett) is at the peak of his career, acclaimed throughout Europe. His name alone suggests countless affairs and scandals - which is exactly what his manager Urbani (Jared Harris) is doing his utmost to cultivate, for it is in his interest to market his famous client the best way possible.

Business-savvy Urbani ultimately manages to bring Paganini to the British capital, albeit against his will.

Musician and manager are forced to take refuge at Watson's home, where Paganini quickly takes a liking to his host's lovely daughter Charlotte (Andrea Deck), a talented singer. She and the violinist find the way to each other's hearts through music - and Paganini falls undyingly in love with the young beauty. This displeases Urbani, however, who fears he will lose his influence on his protegé. He begins to craft a diabolical plan...
