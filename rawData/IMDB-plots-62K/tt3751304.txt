Self Made tells the story of two women - one Israeli, the other Palestinian- who are trapped within their respective worlds. After a mix-up at a checkpoint, they find themselves living the life of the other on the opposite side of the border.
Michal is an avant garde artist and something of a celebrity in Israel. She is having a bad day, much of it amnesia-related: her husband unexpectedly flew overseas for a conference, her bed collapsed and the replacement appears faulty, interviewers keep unexpectedly appearing at her house (though they do have an appointment), her bath is filled with crabs. Meanwhile, in another part of town Nadine, a Palestinian woman, has just been fired, indirectly due to something Michal said. For Nadine, every day involves checkpoints, body searches and suspicion. Then their paths cross, and their lives are strangely altered.
