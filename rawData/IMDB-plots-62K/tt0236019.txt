After a one-night stand a couple is faced with the terrifying possibility of what they really want.
He wakes up in her bed. He's Josh, an Australian photographer living in London, on holiday in Sydney, leaving in three days. She's Cinthia (Cin), a dress designer. They've met at a party and shared a cab back to their respective places, they're attracted to each other, he'll be gone in three days (no complications), so he stays the night. Each of them talks to the camera occasionally, commenting on what happens; so do her female friends and his male ones. An omniscient taxi driver also helps out. How will those three days go? What could be better than sex?
