Uryu Shinbei appeals his boss's corruption and his appeal is denied. He is kicked out from the han. Shortly afterwards, his wife Shino collapses from a disease and dies. Right before her death, she tells Shinbei, "I hope you go back to the han and help Uneme Sakakibara." Shinbei and Uneme were friends, but they became rivals to gain Shino's affection. Uneme is also related to Shinbei's exile.
