Unlikely friends in a melting pot of confusion. Simon Murray fights for the French Foreign Legion. Pascal Dupont fights for himself. War torn men question honour, hope, morality...because you can desert everything...except yourself.
Rebuffed in love and uncertain of life, Simon is the story of a young Englishman's physical and spiritual journey during Algeria's battle for independence from France. Driven by romantic illusion to join the French Foreign Legion, Simon learns what it truly means to be a hero. A timeless, coming of age story set against the epic, sweeping landscape of North Africa.
