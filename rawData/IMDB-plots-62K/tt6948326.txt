Based on the life of the former head of Peugeot, Christian Stieff, the film serves as a wake up call for those enslaved in the unrelenting arduousness of contemporary existence. A high profile businessman who has let his personal life lapse in favour of corporate success. When he suffers a serious stroke and wakes up in hospital he finds himself stripped back to zero. He leans to rebuild his life with the help of a therapist and his family.
