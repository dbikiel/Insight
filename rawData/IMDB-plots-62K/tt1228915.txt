The first installment of a planned trilogy, director Francisco Laresgoiti's speculative sci-fi thriller finds the son of a powerful general caught in the middle of a raging class war between the privileged elite, and the downtrodden masses. In the year 2033, Mexico has become a fascist state. As the upper classes partake in debauched parties and amuse themselves by using the poor for target practice, a highly addictive drink called Pactia keeps the working class under control. Meanwhile, the religious minority forms a resistance movement, and finds an unlikely ally in the guise of privileged military brat Pablo. Despite his sheltered upbringing, Pablo knows the difference between good and evil. And once a line is drawn in the sand, he is compelled to turn against everything he's ever known in the fight for the future of humanity.
The year 2033 has arrived to Mexico City, re-baptised as Villaparaiso (Paradise City). The mechanical, caothic and hot megacity is ruled by a military and tyrant government. It is an oppressed society with its religious faith and liberty of expression stolen. Pablo, the main character, is a young finantial yuppie that gets shelter in drugs and alcohol. He leaves his privileged life in order to help the unprotected and destroy the system that controls the human being. Pablo meets Lozada, a hidden priest, Father Miguel, that will eventually transform his life. Pablo lives with the needy and helps sick people that suffer due to chemical products they eat sold by the main company of Villaparaíso. Addictive products that make them work for long hors. Pablo fights with other believers in order to destroy the regime. On his way, he meets Lucía, a girl that gives a higher sense to his life.
