Montanans Jim Redfern and Mike Evans head into Canada's British Columbia via the Cariboo Trail intent to raise cattle and dig for gold but find trouble instead.
Jim Redfern dreams of owning his own cattle ranch and along with his partners Mike Evans and Ling heads off on the Cariboo Trail into the interior of British Columbia. There's a gold rush on and along the way they're joined by old-timer Grizzly Winters, a prospector who hasn't had much luck of late. They soon come up against Frank Walsh whose men stampede their cattle. Evans is severely injured forcing Redfern to amputate his left arm. Evans hates him for that and will have nothing to do with him or his dream of the cattle ranch. Walsh owns the local town making it difficult for Redfern to get re-established. Things begin to go his way when he finds gold.
While the gold fever is sweeping the Cariboo Region, extending from Kamloops to Prince George, of British Columbia in western Canada, a man heads up into the region with his herd of cattle, because he thinks he can make even more money by rearing animals in the fine pastures. However, his traveling companion turns against him and a local tycoon opposes his plans, leading to a bloody gunfight during which all is resolved.
