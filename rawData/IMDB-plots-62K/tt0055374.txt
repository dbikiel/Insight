In the 1960s Oregon, two sheriff deputies arrest three teenagers for robbery but are overpowered and taken hostage while forest fires rage all around them.
Frank Gorshin and his girlfriend, Joyce Taylor, are on the run from the law when apprehended and arrested by the Sherriff, David Janssen. During the transport to jail Gorshin escapes and in the ensuing chase a forest fire is started. The nearby small town is threatened and the only means of escape is by train, led by David Janssen.
After being arrested, three teenage delinquents overpower and take a Deputy Sheriff hostage. Using him as a guide, the teens force the Deputy to lead them through the Oregon forest in an attempt to escape. Meanwhile, the local Sheriff's Department and townspeople band together to track down the fugitives and rescue the Deputy.
Three teenagers are picked up on an APB for a gas station holdup in Tacoma. On the way to the sheriff's station, they pull a gun, force the officers into the woods and eventually trek over miles of dense forest trying to make their getaway.
