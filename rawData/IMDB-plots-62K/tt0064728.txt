Two men kidnap a girl off the streets, take her to a beach house owned by a drug-addicted stewardess, and hold her for ransom.
Things start to go wrong for a group of criminals after they kidnap a young heiress and hold her for ransom at a beach house in France. Fighting among the co-conspirators boils over shortly after the ransom is picked up, leading to a violent end for most.
At Paris' Orly Airport a young girl is kidnaped by a burly chauffeur, Bud, and his sadistic companion, Leer. Quartered in an isolated beachhouse, she is introduced to the other gang members, including Vi, whom the she recognizes as the stewardess on her flight, and Vi's brother Wally. Discovering that Vi is addicted to drugs and suspecting that Leer intends to sexual assault their hostage, Bud suggests ending the scheme. Wally, however, dissuades him. While Bud, Wally, and Vi, drive to the village cafe to pick up the ransom, Leer guards the girl. At the cafe the gang murders its proprietor and a gendarme. As Vi and Wally alight from the car they are shot down by the perfidious Leer, who is in turn murdered by Bud. Upon entering the house Bud discovers the expiring victim hanging from the wall, stripped, lacerated, and shot in the back. As Bud frees her body, the victim awakens in the plane. Awaiting her is the chauffeur...
