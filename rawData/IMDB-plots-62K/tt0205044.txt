Meandering amid a hot Athenian summer, Odysseas finds himself in Hydra, after losing his job. There, an elusive dark-haired nymph lures him into a dream-like hunt for the ideal love, tempting him to embrace life. Will he emerge a new man?
Out of the blue--in the middle of a hot and dry Athenian summer--the married family man and hard-working accountant for fifteen long years, Odysseas, loses his job. Surprisingly indifferent, bored to death, and with his pockets crammed with severance pay, the freshly fired paterfamilias starts meandering in the bustling metropolis, only to find himself aboard a fast Flying Dolphin hydrofoil boat to sun-kissed Hydra. There, an elusive dark-haired nymph--the living embodiment of the ideal love and the fleeting youth--will lure Odysseas into a desperate and seemingly endless dream-like sequence, tempting him to embrace life. During the course of a single day, Odysseas' journey will go full circle to where everything started. Will he emerge a new man?
