It's 1955 and curious 14-year-old Bronx kid Lenny has a mission for his summer: to witness two adults in the midst of an "act of love." When his mother sends him to Queens to stay with his pregnant aunt and uncle, Lenny thinks his plan is doomed, until he meets his gorgeous adult neighbor Hedy and hooks up with some like-minded neighborhood kids. Soon, Lenny is learning more than he ever expected about life, love and growing up.
Lenny is a typical 14-year-old from the Bronx. Like every teenage boy, he is totally fascinated with the concept of sex. But the year is 1955, and Lenny is too young and too scared to actually "do it." So he dedicates his summer vacation to the next best thing. Seeing two other people do it. Easier said than done. Caught in the act of spying, his mother and stepfather ship him off to spend the summer with his aunt and uncle in "the country" Queens. His plan looks like a bust, and his summer seems destined for boredom, until he meets a whole new group of friends. Young teens who have a "sex club." They don't do it; they just talk about it, but these kids have a lot more interesting information than was available in the Bronx. And then he meets Hedy; a nurse, twice his age, and gorgeous - in a former life she modeled for bra ads. Lenny is both smitten and inspired, and his goal for the summer kicks into high gear. Lenny's plan to "witness an act of love" becomes an obsession, which turns a summer vacation into an adventure that will change his life forever.
