The photographic record of an African expedition led by producer-explorer Armand Denis and his (very) photogenic and camera-toting wife Michaela, who goes bird-riding at an ostrich farm. The expedition ranges from the central interior jungles and mountains to both coasts and as far south as Capetown, and ends with a gorilla hunt led by natives using 100-year-old muskets. Denis produced and directed with the entire production under the supervision of Jay Bonafield and Douglas Travers, with commentary written by Jerome Brondfield and Burton Benjamin and camerawork credited to Tom Stobart, Phil Scultz, Robert Carmet and Eric White.
