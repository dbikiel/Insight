Jeff Dunham and his socially reckless "suitcase posse" are back in this highly anticipated follow-up to Arguing with Myself, his breakthrough television special! What's next? An ALL NEW show that is Bigger... Better... and Funnier than ever! This time, Dunham welcomes two never-before-seen partners "Achmed the Dead Terrorist," and "Melvin the Superhero." Long-time favorites "Peanut," "Walter" and Jose Jalapeno...On a STEEK! are back in an entirely original show for everyone!
Combining his amazing talent and his unorthodox sense of humor, Jeff Dunham returns, yet again, with an hilarious ventriloquist performance. Starting off with the infamously known Walter, scrutinizing every bit of today's American society.
Followed by two new characters, Achmed the Dead Terrorist, who continuously threatens the crowd with Silence and Death, and Melvin the Superhero, who can stop a speeding bullet! ... only once...
He wraps up the show with the adorable Peanut and an uncanny debate between him and Jose Jallapinio (on a Stick).
Brilliantly written with an Outstanding performance.
