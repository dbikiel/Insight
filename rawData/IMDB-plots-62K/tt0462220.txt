CAMP DAZE takes you back to the days of tube socks, bongs hits and short shorts, throws in a quiet summer camp full of blood and mayhem and watches the fun unfold.
A group of kids break down while driving down a remote forest road. After a disturbing night alone in the woods, they stumble upon Camp Hiawatha in full swing and packed with seemingly happy teenagers. However, the teens and the camp itself are strangely trapped back in 1981. The clothes, the music, the hair, and the attitudes are 24 years back in time. The campers are forced to relive the same day and night over and over again. The night when a silent killer stalked the camp silencing campers and counselors one by one. The kids from the present struggle to understand and help the teens from 1981 break free of the curse. Working together both time-periods begin to learn about the different worlds from which they come and what it will take for all of them to survive.
