The fates of three German-born Muslims in Berlin collide as they struggle to find their place between faith and modern life in contemporary western society, caught at a crossroads where alluring liberated lifestyles conflict with deeply-rooted traditions.
Ismail is a married Berlin policeman, raised according to Turkish tradition but lost contact with spiritual matters. Finding at a raid Leyla, whom he had to shoot three years earlier, mentally shaken Ismail lets Leyla go but can't forget about her, seeks contact but finds helping Leyla doesn't sooth his guilt, while she looks at him differently. Modern, free-spirited Maryam (19) calls her single father Vedat, a modern liberal imam, a hypocrite for condemning her pregnancy out of wedlock. Traumatized when her morning after pill induces incessant bleeding, Maryam fears divine punishment and turns devout, starting a contorted relationship with Samir. Gay white German Daniel has an open pubertal crush on Nigerian meat market colleague Samir, even joins him at Vedat's Koran class, but Samir lets his backward mother convince him to reject his reciprocal feelings, even tries to break off their friendship and turns viciously on him.
