Three separate stories about the same thing: le plaisir (pleasure).
Three stories about pleasure. The first one is about a man hiding his age behind a mask to keep going to balls and fancying women, pleasure and youth. Then comes the long tale of Julia Tellier (Madeleine Renaud) taking her girls (whores) to the country for attending her niece's communion, pleasure and purity. And lastly, Jean (Daniel GÃ©lin) the painter falling in love with his model, pleasure and death.
