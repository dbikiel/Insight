Two young French soldiers take a three-day leave in Cyprus after finishing their tour of duty in Afghanistan.
At the end of their tour of duty in Afghanistan, two young military women, Aurore and Marine, are given three days of decompression leave with their unit at a five-star resort in Cyprus, among tourists. But it's not that easy to forget the war and leave the violence behind.
Having completed a traumatising tour of duty in Afghanistan, the childhood friends, Aurore and Marine, along with the rest of their unit, arrive in a five-star Cypriot resort for a mandatory three-day "decompression" course. There, with the aid of state-of-the-art virtual reality technology, the French troops share their painful memories and relive their deep psychological traumas, in an attempt to analyse the failed strategies in a long and tense group therapy. However, even though this treatment is designed to help the fighters blow off some steam, little by little, unbridled aggression starts to build up, giving way to savage violence among brothers-in-arms. Will this brief stopover put to the test not only Aurore and Marine's friendship but also the entire group's bonds?
