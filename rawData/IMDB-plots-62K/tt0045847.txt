A young gunslinger tries to help a rancher and his daughter save their land and cattle from an evil, wealthy land owner.
Kittridge is hired by the villains but turns to defend the rancher Saxon after learning the true situation. Kittridge wins Saxon's ranch with a cut of the cards but Saxon has other reasons for deliberately losing the gamble. Telford and Lake try everything from bushwhacking to setting a wildfire to stop the Saxon/Kittridge herd of cattle from reaching the railhead.
Gunslinger Reb Kittridge rides into town expecting to take a job helping badman Matt Telford get rid of Dan Saxon, now the only other farmer in the basin. Instead the wily Saxon arranges that Kittridge become owner of his ranch, so the gunman lands up with the job of getting a cattle herd to their buyer while he fights off Telford and his men. He also has to find time to romance Saxon's pretty but independent daughter.
