An older woman discovers that her multi-million dollar fortune was based on embezzlement, so she sets out to right the wrong. She goes to America to meet the young woman who is the one and only heir to the embezzled man years before. She works in a department store, in love with a struggling pianist. When the handsome young attorney tries to give the young woman a check for a million dollars, the heiress doesn't believe it. On the sly, the older woman befriends the younger woman.
Pamela is just your average working class girl trying to make ends meet and maintain a positive outlook on life. Happy as a clam living in a boarding house across the hall from her surly boyfriend Pete, Pamela hasn't a care in the world other than meeting her rent. As it happens, Pamela meets an older lady who is moving in to the boarding house. Pamela takes the lady under her merry wing and treats her to a dinner at the Italian joint where Pete plays piano. Over the course of the next few days, the lady (who is rather well to do) hires an attorney to give Pamela 1 million dollars. The result of which causes Pamela and Pete's lives to be turned upside down until they finally focus on what is important.
