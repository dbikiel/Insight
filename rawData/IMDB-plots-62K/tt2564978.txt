After leaving a doctor visit with the worst news, Valerie Dreyfuss and her sister Melissa come to a stop on a lonely stretch of road. Their car is engulfed by a blinding light....12 hours later Valerie wakes to the horror that her sister is gone, nowhere to be found.
Valerie leaves her doctor's office with her sister, Melissa, after receiving horrific news. Valerie has terminal cancer and no amount of treatment will save her. While driving home together, their car suddenly stops and they are engulfed in a blinding light. Valerie blacks out and when she awakens, her sister has disappeared without a trace. Months later, Melissa is still missing, but Valerie's cancer has completely disappeared, much to the disbelief of her doctor. Valerie, with the help of her cop boyfriend, Carter, devotes her entire life to finding her sister and to discover what happened to them on that fateful night. Valerie has considered every possibility for Melissa's disappearance except for one-alien abduction. It would be insanity to think that aliens abducted her sister and cured her cancer. Or is it? Valerie's dreams and visions of aliens would suggest otherwise. She stumbles across a book by a Dr. Reed called "Lost Time," which seems to explain the phenomena she is experiencing. She goes to meet Dr. Reed, who promises her answers if she checks herself into his institution for evaluation. She agrees, against the wishes of Carter. What she finds in the institution is beyond explanation. Nothing is as it seems and the concept of reality is turned inside out! And what exactly is Dr. Reed-Human? Alien? Or a new strain of being entirely? It is up to Carter to rescue Valerie from the evil clutches of Dr. Reed and his alien minions, before it's too late.
