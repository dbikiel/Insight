Alejandra and her dad Roberto have just moved to town. She is new at school, he has a new job. Starting over is sometimes complicated when you have left so much behind.
With the loss of a beloved mother and wife still fresh and raw in their memory, the dejected Roberto and his teenage daughter, Alejandra, flee the coastal Puerto Vallarta to start anew in bustling Mexico City. But, there--even though Roberto has already a job as a chef lined up for him, and Alejandra seems to have no trouble fitting in at her new school--unforeseen problems lead both to a tense situation which will, inevitably, spiral out of control. In the end, life is full of fresh beginnings; however, on the other hand, making a life change can be very intimidating, especially when you have lost everything.
