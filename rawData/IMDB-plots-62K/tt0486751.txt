Chacun Sa Nuit explores the carnal interdependencies among a host of characters who live in a town in provincial France. At the center of it all is Pierre (Arthur Dupont), a conceited and vain bisexual musician in his late teens who acts as a magnet, to varying degrees, for a whole array of characters - from his sister, Lucie (Lizzie Brocher√©), with whom he has a heated incestuous relationship, to a city councilor with whom he participates in gay orgies. When Pierre turns up dead, Lucie investigates the reasons for his demise and charts the network of sadomasochistic relationships that crisscross the town.
Chacun Sa Nuit ("To Each His Night") is a modern study of French teens which turns into a murder mystery. Narrated by the lone female in a quintet of very close friends, her narcissistic, bisexual twin brother ends up dead and she is bent on solving the crime. Rather than a whodunnit movie, in which the audience has clues, here all we can do is go along for the ride -- trying, with the sister, to unravel what happened and why. Contains non-sexual nudity, some sexual content and profanity.
