The obstacles facing the perilous mission of 12-year-olds Ida, Sebastian and Jonas are many: a bank vault 30 meters above ground to open, secret combinations to crack, vicious guard dogs to wrestle, watchmen to distract and a bank manager to fool. Not to mention surviving a hair-raising go-cart race through narrow city streets with a hoard of cops in hot pursuit. Equipped with state-of-the-art climbing gear, a few borrowed go-carts and a couple of wild, throbbing hearts set on winning Ida's love, the trio plan the most audacious bank heist in the history of Denmark: to steal 1.5 million DKK from CCT Bank Europe's new headquarters - by breaking into the world's most secure bank vault.
