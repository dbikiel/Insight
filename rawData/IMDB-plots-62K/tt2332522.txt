A documentary shot in the North Atlantic and focused on the commercial fishing industry.
This film is more of an assemblage of random sensory experiences on board a fishing vessel than anything else. The audience experiences the sights and sounds from the perspectives of various parts of the ships, crew mates, and even the fishes and birds. There is no plot to speak of, just various glimpses of typical activity aboard a fishing vessel. These activities include such things as detangling large chains, winding huge ropes, emptying nets full of fishes, sorting, gutting, and cleaning fishes and shellfish, dumping refuse, exploring nether regions of the vessel, riding along with the bow (above and below water), flying along with the gulls, shelling scallops, dumping starfish (ever seen a galaxy of starfish before?).Camera angles sometimes are randomly oriented, resulting in gulls flying sideways, appearance of seaweed wafting by overhead, and so forth.There is some dialog, but it's essentially unimportant.
