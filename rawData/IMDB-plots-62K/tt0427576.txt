She's an avid mystery lover and bookseller, for whom crime has been comfortably confined to the pages of her favorite novels-until a real-life murder turns a weekend of fun and games into a chilling whodunit... The quaint mystery bookshop bequeathed to Samantha Kinsey may be struggling, but the idea she's concocted for the weekend should drum up some killer publicity-a book signing by three very popular and very competitive mystery writers: Maura Hobbs, Angela Cooke, and the reclusive Clare Beckman. Unbeknownst to Sam, Clare is using this "mystery weekend" to make the shocking announcement of her retirement. Just as Clare poses for a final career photograph, an ear-shattering gunshot rings out. Clare manages to dodge the bullet, but later falls victim to a cleverly planted poison. Wading through a long list of suspects and motives, Sam manages to uncover a convoluted plot of blackmail, greed, and deceit-a real-life mystery that would have thrilled Clare...had she lived to see it unfold.
When the book shop hosts a mystery weekend, recluse hit author Clare Beckman announces her retirement, DA Cassie is hit by what may well be a failed attempt. Charming new lawyer Scott Tyler dates both friends. The weapon was registered by oldest attending local Dorothy, who rather risks arrest by the chief then accepting help or disclosing the truth, including about her ex Derek. Later, Clare mysteriously dumps fiancee Grant and dies from bee poison, which only works due to her allergy which few people knew about.
