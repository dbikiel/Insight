"Punto y raya" is the story of a young Colombian recruit who, while patrolling his country's border, is befriended by a Venezuelan adversary, and the tragic consequences of their relationship.
Cheito, a street-wise Venezuelan conscript, is thrown together with Pedro, a straight-arrow volunteer in the Colombian army, when one deserts his company and the other lives through an ambush. They must survive guerrillas, drug producers, corrupt narcotics officers, and each other as they bungle through the jungle: first they are enemies, then allies, then friends, until women and politics test their loyalties. Can pawns survive when powers clash?
Cheito and Pedro, one Venezuelan and the other Colombian are on the border between the two countries during a time of heightened nationalism. One comes to defend his country; the other has a firm vocation: desertion. Both of them, enemies for nationality, are locked in a small but brutal battle. The wild geography restricts them to areas controlled by the guerrilla, camps of drug traffickers, indigenous tribes and lawless people, where the only way to survive is by joining forces. As a result, friendship grows up between them. But once the friendship gains body and soul, treachery rears its ugly head.
