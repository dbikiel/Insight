A live-in aide has no place to live.
With no place to call home, 19-year-old Elena takes a job as a live-in aide. She finds herself thrust into the middle of a family in crisis: all the things that go on between a father, grandmother, mother, and cat. Eventually, Elena strikes something of a balance though... That is, until the prodigal son returns home. Placing fictional characters alongside real people, 'Exit Elena' is shot through with all the rough edges inherent to family life and home movie form.
