A cabaret dancer witnesses a murder and is forced to hide from gangsters by disguising herself as a male Princeton student.
Curly Flagg, Philadelphia nightclub dancer, witnesses a murder and runs away to avoid being held as material witness. Landing in Princeton, she hides out in a college dorm, decked out in men's clothes and haircut by students Paul and Buzz. Soon, converging on Princeton are: 1) publicity men for Buzz's dad's movie studio; 2) Paul's irate fianc√©e Frances; 3) killer Mugg, who wants to rub out Curly. By the time they arrive yet another girl is after Paul: Midge, the dean's daughter.
