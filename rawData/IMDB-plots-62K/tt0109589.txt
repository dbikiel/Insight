Disillusioned private detective haunted by the past, Joe Keyes, must protect a strange little girl and her secretive mother from a homicidal scientist in search of immortality.
A secretive young woman hires disillusioned private eye Joe Keyes to locate her husband, Warren Rickman. He does so, only to realize too late he was followed by two strange, seemingly bulletproof, yet highly inflammable goons disguised as milkmen, who attack them, assassinate Rickman and frame Joe for murder. With the help of his friend, Det. Sgt. Eldon James, Joe locates Mrs. Rickman and her little daughter Gracie who turn out to be under the protection of his ex, Monica Quik. He learns that Gracie is infected with revolutionary futuristic nanobots known as "Deep Red" which possess incredible healing ability that illustrious scientist Dr. Thomas Newmeyer wants for himself no matter the cost, and the "milkmen" are working for him. Joe agrees to help the girls even though the case brings back painful memories of his disastrous attempt to save the family of Eldon's partner, Mack Waters, who's been holding a serious grudge ever since and really wants to see Joe dead.
