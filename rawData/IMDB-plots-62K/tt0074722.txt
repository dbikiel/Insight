Earth's Moon has been ripped from its orbit by a massive nuclear explosion and cast adrift in unknown space. The more than 300 surviving personnel of Moonbase Alpha find that the drifting Moon on which they are situated has become locked on a collision course with the giant planet Astheria and then is pulled into the center of a black hole in space. The intervention of a higher power saves the Alphans from destruction in both instances.
