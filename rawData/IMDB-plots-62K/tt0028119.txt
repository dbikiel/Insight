The legendary sailors Popeye and Sindbad do battle to see which one is the greatest.
After sending his giant bird, Rokh, to wreck Popeye's boat and kidnap Olive Oyl, Sindbad forces Olive to dance for him by firing buckshot at her feet with a pea-shooter. Popeye attempts to rescue her while J. Wellington Wimpy follows a duck around with a meat-grinder. After Popeye disposes of Rokh and Sindbad's two-headed, Yiddish-accented giant, Boola, it's a battle to the "finich" between the two legendary sailors.
