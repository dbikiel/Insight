Liza slowly replaces Melampo, Giorgio's dog. While she accepts it, Giorgio forces her to wear collars and leashes.
Withdrawn to a remote and desolate Mediterranean island, Giorgio, a comics' illustrator, seeks the precious peace of mind away from the city, trying hopelessly to prolong somehow his escape from an unbearable reality. There, in this idyllic place, Giorgio leads a simple life along with his dog Melampo, fishing, drawing and salvaging whatever the sea washes ashore, devoid of excitement. But soon, this fragile equilibrium will be disrupted when Giorgio, during a long walk on the beach, will encounter the beautiful Liza who has just left her friends after an argument, and under those circumstances, he will offer her food and shelter. Strangely, however, solitary Giorgio still prefers to talk with his beloved companion Melampo, in complete disregard of his new-found friend, Lisa. Is it possible that Liza simply does not belong there?
