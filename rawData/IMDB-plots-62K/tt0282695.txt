An actor in a Wild West show must become a mythical Western Hero when a biker gang descends upon a small Montana town.
Standard story of a biker gang taking over a town is not saved by the presence of Lou Diamond Phillips as the head biker or Sean Patrcik Flanery as the avenging townsperson who takes on the gangs with the help of an old codger (Robert Forster). The story starts with Phillips and a cohort robbing a store and injuring a salesperson. The bikers tell everyone in the store that if any one tells who committed the crime, the gang will take revenge on them and their families. Flanery nonetheless proceeds to arrest them with a gun filled with blanks when he next sees them. The gang breaks their leader out of jail, killing the policemen in the process. Flanery &amp; Diamond then trade off attacks.
