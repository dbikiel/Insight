A newly wedded couple attempts to build a house with a prefabricated kit, unaware that a rival sabotaged the kit's component numbering.
Buster and Sybil exit a chapel as newlyweds. Among the gifts is a portable house you easily put together in one week. It doesn't help that Buster's rival for Sybil switches the numbers on the crates containing the house parts.
After a beautiful wedding on a fine Monday morning, newly-weds, Buster and Sybil, arrive at lot no. 99 to receive Uncle Mike's generous present: a DIY portable house. However, as the spurned suitor, Handy Hank, manages to renumber the packing boxes, disaster awaits in seven equal parts--after this intelligent sabotage, no one would be able to finish the construction, let alone Buster, the novice builder. From that point on, everything that can possibly go wrong, will go wrong; nevertheless, can a few minor setbacks come between true love?
