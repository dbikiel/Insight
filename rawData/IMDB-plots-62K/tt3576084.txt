A unit of female Israeli soldiers at a remote desert base bide their time as they count down the minutes until they can return to civilian life.
A zany, dark, &amp; comedic portrait of everyday life for a unit of young, female Israeli soldiers. The Human Resources Office at a remote desert base serves as the setting for this cast of characters who bide their time pushing paper and battling in computer games, counting down the minutes until they can return to civilian life. Amidst their boredom and clashing personalities, issues of commitment - to friendship, love, and country - are handled with humor and sharp-edged wit.
&amp;#1488;&amp;#1508;&amp;#1505; &amp;#1489;&amp;#1497;&amp;#1495;&amp;#1505;&amp;#1497; &amp;#1488;&amp;#1504;&amp;#1493;&amp;#1513; &amp;mdash;"Story 01" (.&amp;#1505;&amp;#1497;&amp;#1508;&amp;#1493;&amp;#1512; 01): "The Replacement" (&amp;#1492;&amp;#1502;&amp;#1495;&amp;#1500;&amp;#1497;&amp;#1508;&amp;#1492;)Zohar (Dana Ivgi) and Daffi (Nelly Tagar) are returning to Shizaf칩n, their middle-of-nowhere IDF base, where they work in Personnel along with Irena (Tamara Klingon), two ditzes&amp;mdash;Livnat (Heli Twito) and Liat (Meytal Gal)&amp;mdash;who spend their waking hours singing duets at annoying volume, and various other incompetents, all commanded by the Nurse Ratched -like, gung-ho, drank-the-IDF-Kool-Aid Rama (Shani Klein).With Zohar's aid, Daffi, who's miserable as Chief Paper Shredder of the unit, has composed numerous appeals to headquarters to be transferred to the Kiry치h in Tel Aviv, where she fantasizes about lunching at Azrieli Towers, except that unbeknownst to Daffi, Zohar never sent any of the appeals: She doesn't want Daffi to get transferred, as it would leave her friendless at Shizaf칩n.As the busload of soldiers enters the base, a new girl taps Daffi on the shoulder and asks her where Personnel is, upon which Daffi promptly decides that her appeals to be transferred have been answered and the new girl, Tehila (Yonit Tobi), is her replacement; and Daffi immediately begins training Tehila to take over her job.That night, Eitan (Moshe Ashkenazi) and his girlfriend, Anat (Dana Meinrath), are making out in his quarters, and there's a knock at the door. He quickly covers up Anat (notes of Halfon Hill Doesn't Answer) and gets up to answer. It's Tehila, who had a fling with Eitan the previous summer and has been obsessed with him ever since. She's not a soldier; she borrowed an IDF uniform and entered the base unauthorized (notes of Hair) in order to see him. When she lunges at him and declares her love, Anat emerges from her hiding place, devastating Tehila, who runs out in tears and proceeds to use a box cutter to remove her tattoo of Eitan's name. The following morning, the girls awaken to a pool of blood and a dead Tehila, for which Rama blames the entire Personnel team."Story 02" (.&amp;#1505;&amp;#1497;&amp;#1508;&amp;#1493;&amp;#1512; 02): "The Virgin" (&amp;#1492;&amp;#1489;&amp;#1514;&amp;#1493;&amp;#1500;&amp;#1492;)That night, Zohar's bed collapses and she refuses to sleep in the only vacant bed&amp;mdash;that which had been assigned to Tehila. Exasperated, Irena moves to the vacant bed and during the night is visited by Tehila's ghost, leaving Irena catatonic and non-functioning.Her imagined replacement dead, Daffi decides her only ticket to the Kiryah is by going off to officers' training, which she completes by the skin of her teeth, and gets assigned not to her longed-for spot at the Kiryah, but to replace Rama at Shizaf칩n, on notification of which she bursts into tears.Meanwhile, lonely and at loose ends without Daffi, the girls have begun to taunt Zohar for being a virgin, so Zohar decides to rectify her situation. She seduces a reservist and arranges to meet him that night, telling Rama that Irena ought to see medical personnel, and offering to accompany Irena to the infirmary, to which Rama agrees.Zohar's date, Meir (Elad Smama), attempts to rape her, except just as he's getting ready to enter her, a shot is fired by Irena, who had followed them and grabbed his rifle, which he'd tossed onto the ground in blatant contravention of strict orders. Aiming his rifle at him, Irena orders him over to a waste can, where she orders him to ejaculate into it, "Just like what you were about to do to Zohar". He promptly vomits into the waste can, upon which Irena throws his clothes and rifle at him and orders him to leave the base.As a shaky Zohar and a back-to-normal Irena are returning to their rooms, they encounter Rama, who asks them what they're doing outdoors. Zohar explains, and Irena claims she has no idea what Zohar's talking about. Rama dismisses Irena and punishes Zohar for being AWOL by assigning her the all-night task of cleaning and organizing the Personnel office, including "getting rid of all superfluous paper".The following morning, Rama comes to inspect the office to find it spotless...and every single sheet of paper, including all the soldiers' files, shredded and stuffed into her own office. Rama runs off screaming hysterically, realizing her army career is over."Story 03" (.&amp;#1505;&amp;#1497;&amp;#1508;&amp;#1493;&amp;#1512; 03): "The Commander" (&amp;#1492;&amp;#1502;&amp;#1508;&amp;#1511;&amp;#1491;&amp;#1514;)Meanwhile Daffi arrives to replace Rama and is now commander over her former fellow soldiers, who treat her like a joke and don't accept her authority over them. To show Daffi who's (not) boss, Zohar prints out multiple copies of all of the transfer appeals she composed for Daffi but never sent, and posts them all over the base, where they provide entertainment for all at Daffi's expense.Daffi decides to avenge the humiliating prank by deleting all the games to which Zohar is addicted and which have served as Zohar's lifeline to sanity. As she's doing so, the two get into a staple gun fight, and it's discovered by the base IT guy that instead of deleting the games, Daffi accidentally deleted all the soldiers' files, so now there're no records, either electronic or paper, as the paper files were shredded by Zohar.Daffi and Zohar make up while in detention (notes of The Parent Trap) and are treated for their staple wounds in the infirmary, where Zohar spends the night with IT Guy, with whom we see her snuggling the following morning. The story ends with Zohar getting discharged and alighting from a bus in Tel Aviv, with Azrieli Towers on the horizon.
