In the Italy of WWII, a widow and her lonely daughter seek for distance between them and the horrors of war.
Cesira is a beautiful widow and a successful grocery store owner in Rome. WWII is raging, and she fears for her beloved daughter, 13-year-old Rosetta, amid the daily bombings. They travel to the village where Cesira was born, where Cesira believes they will be safer. There, they are happy even as food dwindles. A young intellectual, Michele, falls in love with Cesira, who is too consumed with the well-being of her daughter and their survival to return his timid advances. As the allies advance, Cesira decides to return to Rome - and encounter the horrors of war at last.
To flee from yet another devastating attack during the Allied bombing of Rome on July 19, 1943, the widowed mother, Cesira, and her 13-year-old daughter, Rosetta, leave behind the capital to find shelter in the rugged and mountainous region of Ciociaria; Cesira's birthplace. There, amid hunger and deprivation, the two women will stumble upon Michele di Libero, the village's charming young intellectual, who is everything Cesira needs--a loving husband for her and a caring father for Rosetta--however, the war is far from over. Can the three of them live a normal life back in Rome in the aftermath of the costly World War Two?
