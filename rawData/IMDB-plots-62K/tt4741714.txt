A young man paying the rent for himself and his lifelong friends at an apartment, ends up flat-broke and resorts to selling marijuana to pay the bills - only to get caught up in the dangerous world of drugs.
Five childhood friends have always dreamed of being roommates. When the opportunity arises for them to move in together, Julia, Vadim, Nestor, and Timoth√©e jump at the chance, especially when Samuel offers to pay half the rent. Hardly have they moved in when Samuel suddenly winds up penniless. He decides not to tell the others and instead starts selling weed to pay his share. But not everyone is cut out to be a dealer, and when the going gets tough, Samuel has no choice but to turn to the only family he has left: his friends.
