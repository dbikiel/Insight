Grammy(R)-nominated comedian Tig Notaro headlines and directs this stand-up comedy special taped at the Wilbur Theatre in Boston, MA. Known for her distinctive storytelling, offbeat sense of humor and honesty, Notaro's deadpan stand-up style draws on highly personal experiences, including a breast-cancer diagnosis and the death of her mother.
