Manjardo, a young Gypsy leader headed by Tulio, has spent a lively and joyful life with his young women, Glafira and very keen Akris. He will soon be married to the daughter of the master of another tribe, Esmeralda. From this, her mistresses are no more enthusiastic than Esmeralda and Manjardoka, so the parties of this future couple have never even met each other.
