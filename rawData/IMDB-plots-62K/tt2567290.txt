Music short for Sigur Ros.
The film tells the story about a young girl Sara, played by Elle Fanning, who confronts the imminent death of her father, played by John Hawkes. The story is set in the desolate landscape of an economic collapse. It's about the fine line between keeping it together and the feeling of helplessness when life just doesn't work any longer. But the story is not only about sorrow, but about hope, love and the loss of fear, rebirth and reincarnation. The idea that we possibly have travelled through time with the same souls in different roles. The daughter now holds her father as he begins a new life in her arms.
