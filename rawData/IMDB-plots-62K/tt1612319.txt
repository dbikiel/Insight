It's been 5 years since the Re-Animates outbreak that wiped out 85% of the world's population. Within a few cities, the Re-Animates have been segregated into "zones" and are policed by the R-Division of the QUASI S.W.A.T. Unit.
It's been 5 years since the outbreak that wiped out 85% of the world's population, but the war between Re-Animates (Re-Ans) and Humans wages on. Most of the major cities are still uninhabitable. Within the few surviving cities, the Re-Ans have been segregated into "zones" and are policed by the R-Division of the QUASI S.W.A.T. Unit who hunt to re-kill the Re-Ans in the hope of quelling a second outbreak.
After a Zombie Apocalypse, most of the world's population has been annihilated. The R-Division is trying to eliminate the last zombies (called Re-Animates or Re-Ans) in segregated zones to avoid a second and final outbreak and rebuild Earth. Their operation is filmed and showed in television as a reality show. The efficient Sarge commands a team of veteran soldiers and despite their experience, there are usually casualties. When they decide to investigate a compound, they find an army with thousands of Re-Ans. Will mankind be doomed to disappear?
