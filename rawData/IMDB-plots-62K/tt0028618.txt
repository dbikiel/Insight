Eddie Haines is a radio reporter with Station KBC. He is always getting the scoop, which infuriates those at the New York Star, which happens to employ his ex-girlfriend Mary Bradley. But when Mary is kidnapped while thinking she is getting a scoop on a big story, Eddie and Mary, (ie. the print media and the radio media), must work together to rescue her.
Fast-talking Eddie Haines, a former newspaper reporter who has gone to the 'other side,' as a newscaster/reporter for a radio station, because he can report the news while it is happening, has lost his girlfriend, Mary Bradley, a newspaper reporter who has disdain for Eddie's methods and jealousy for his ability to scoop the printed news. But Eddie goes to her rescue when she is kidnapped by gangsters.
