What do high school students usually do? While away their days dissatisfied with and unhappy about their lives. These four Okinawans are little different. Toru meets Nagisa, with her long hair and cute face, at a local aquarium and falls in love. They coincidentally meet again at a rap concert, but it turns out not to be the encounter for which Toru hopes. It is a show by Workaholics, which inspires Toru and friends to form their own group.
