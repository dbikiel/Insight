In the South Pacific islands, two brothers, one good and one bad, fight over the same girl and over a bag of pearls.
Sea-faring saga of two brothers (Robert Taylor, Stewart Granger) and the woman they both love. Set against South Pacific islands, this love triangle pits the good brother against the bad as they squabble over Ann Blyth and a bag of pearls on the floor of a lagoon; the bad boy redeems himself, however, by helping fend off a mutiny.
1857, New Bedford, Massachusetts. The Shores have long been a whaling family, Mark Shore the current hired captain of the Nathan Ross. The Nathan Ross returns to port after whaling the South Pacific captained by who was the first mate, James Finch, as Mark abandoned ship on the Gilberts, it uncertain if he left on his own volition due to his heavy drinking, or if he was killed by natives. Mark's already slightly tarnished name and that also of the Shores takes a hit regardless of the reason for Mark's disappearance. To demonstrate his continued faith in the Shores, Asa Worthen, the owner of the Nathan Ross, appoints Mark's younger brother, Joel Shore, as the ship's new captain. Joel and Mark did not see eye to eye on life's issues due to their differing personalities, Joel who is considered the responsible one. Despite not considering Mark a friend, Joel is still determined at least to sail around the Gilberts to find out conclusively what happened to him. Before sailing, Joel and Priscilla Holt marry, she who Joel asks to sail with the ship. Both Mark and Joel had always been sweet on Pris, and she on them, with she likely to have ended up with Mark if not for his disappearance. In whaling the South Pacific, Joel is able to find Mark. Mark's return into Joel's life, specifically for the reason behind his disappearance, causes problems in Joel's marriage to Pris, and in Joel's ability to captain the ship, all at the core from the fundamental differences between the brothers.
