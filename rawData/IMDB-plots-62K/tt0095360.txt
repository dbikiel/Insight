A biography of the rock music star.
This "biography" evolves around the nearly 240 hours of film and videotape fortuitously taken by Lennon of his life. The archive footage is transformed into a fascinating life story of one of the most complex and fascinating men of the modern music era. This effort includes a 36 song soundtrack. Includes some very personal and insightful footage, never before made available to the public.
This a documentary taken from the various home movies arranged by John Lennon as a personal record and edited into this film to be a rebuttal to the character assassination in the biography, "The Lives of John Lennon".
