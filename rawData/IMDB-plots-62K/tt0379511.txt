In an unnamed country in a small village the young local executioner is carrying out the execution of three people on the orders of the outside hard core cleric, Hadji. After the first two are shot, he is told to stop, because Hadji believes that executing the young women will send the young virgin to heaven. Instead Hadji orders the young executioner to marry and deflower the virgin, so she will end up in hell after her execution. This is the start of the executioner's crisis of faith.
