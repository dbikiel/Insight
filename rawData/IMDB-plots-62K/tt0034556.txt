Superman versus extortionists with a super-powerful rocket car.
Extortionists with a super-powerful bullet-shaped flying rocket car threaten destruction to Metropolis. At first they seem to defeat even Superman, but their capture of Lois Lane spurs him to new efforts...
The city of Metropolis has received an ultimatum, from a gang known as "The Bulleteers," that unless the treasury funds of the city are turned over to them that destruction will rain down from the skies, and proceed to prove it by destroying the city hall. "The Bullteers," in their self-propelled projectile attempt to make good their extortion threat, but Superman arrives in time to rescue Lois Lane, from the clutches of her kidnappers, destroy the machine and capture the gang.
