Three Russian expatriates are loving life and seducing women in New York City until they meet up with Saint Valentine in disguise and he curses them with impotence until they learn about true love. No love - no sex.
Three Russian friends work in New York, party hard and chase women. It's great times until they get cursed by a drunken Russian night club owner, who turns out to be Saint Valentine. St. Valentine's curse is simple - the guys lose all their manly powers until they find their true love. It turns out to be harder than it sounds - our boys have a lot of growing up to do. Fast."
