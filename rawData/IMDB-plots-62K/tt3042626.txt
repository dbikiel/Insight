Our filthy hero Gus mutters to himself, just before stealing a white Rolls Royce. He happens upon Ruby, a stunning tattoo artist he's always had a thing for, and waves her into the convertible. The misfits escape the city and into nature, sharing a joint, wondering why things used to be so much cooler in the '70s. Asthma is a modern romance that explores addiction in a fresh and honest way. She warns him not to fall in love with her, but the higher you are the harder you fall.
