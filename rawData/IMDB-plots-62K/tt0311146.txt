Dante and Randal are back and trapped in Dante's car during a very bad traffic jam while talking about a "flying car" from The Jetsons.
Kevin was commissioned to shoot the first ever short film aired on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. The result was the return of Randal and Dante from 'Clerks' in this six-minute-long short film shown on The Tonight Show and downloadable at the View Askew web site (www.viewaskew.com). This short is a discussion of the absence of the "flying car" and the hypothetical question posed asking "what would you do to get a flying car?" Funny dialogue between characters leads up to a hilarious punch-line which ties it all together in a Kevin Smith trademark style.
