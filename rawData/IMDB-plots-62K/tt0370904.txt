Instead of really living her life, since losing her mother at age seven, Seattle lawyer Amy Myer sticks to a ridiculously detailed time-line mother drew as a guideline in all walks of life, even love in search of marriage with 'number 7'. Despite good advice from father Bernie, aunt Rachel and uncle ray, she refuses to contemplate going steady with any of the six first steady boyfriends, even apparently perfect businessman Daniel McCandles. She initially declines accompanying a good friend, bagel shop manager Connor, to a family wedding as his pretend-fianc√©e, but changes her mind so Daniel can be lucky seven afterward. However, Peter proves a perfect match, and able to make her reconsider the blind life schedule.
Before Amy Myer's mother died when Amy was 7, she planned out the little girl's life on a timeline, including the fact that Amy would marry her 7th boyfriend. When Amy falls in love with #6, she's thrown into a tailspin, because all of her mother's advice had worked perfectly. Now she must decide whether to follow her mother's advice and wait for #7, or follow her own heart.
