After playing a pagan ritual on a dare, a group of high school students find themselves trapped in an endless cycle of their worst fears.
A partying teen and her friends decide to perform an ancient pagan ritual found online called 'The Midnight Game': Candles are lit. A drop of blood is spilled. Their worst fears are confessed and an entity is summoned. But if the rules are not followed exactly, punishment is promised. Tonight, the game is not being taken seriously. A demonic horror has been unleashed. And now, even daylight cannot stop the nightmares that may destroy them all.
