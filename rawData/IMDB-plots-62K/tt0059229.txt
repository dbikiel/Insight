Visions, memories, and mysticism all help a 40-something woman to find the strength to leave her cheating husband.
Juliet lives in a beautiful house by the ocean. Her sisters, and especially her Mother overshadow her with their beauty. She is a spiritual, superstitious and naive woman. She visits a psychic seer who tells her she must follow the sex trade in order to be happy. Not long after she meets her eccentric and sexy neighbour, Suzy, who, by all counts appears to be a high class prostitute and encourages Juilet into sexual acts which make her guilty and nervous. A rare night when her husband is at home she wakes up to catch him talking to another woman on the phone. He calls out the name "Gabriella" while sleeping, but when she questions him he lies his way out of it. She finds out who Gabriella is and fears her husband will leave her. Juliet begins having visions who accuse and terrorize her. The pinnacle of the visions comes at the end where it is implied she realizes she would be better off without her husband and is ultimately emotionally emancipated.
Giulietta Boldini's middle-aged and married to a man who's having an affair with a younger woman. She believes there has to be a better life for her - out there. She's afraid of the unknown. Assisted by her new friend and neighbour, a free spirit, named, Suzy, Giulietta sets off on a quest to find what her future might bring - and to perhaps have the courage to leave her husband, and her comfortable life.
