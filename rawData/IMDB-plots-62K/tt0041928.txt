Star major league pitcher Monty Stratton loses a leg in a hunting accident, but becomes determined to leave the game on his own terms.
The movie is about Chicago White Sox pitcher Monty Stratton (Jimmy Stewart), who in the 1930s, compiled a 37-19 won-loss record in three seasons. After he became the winningest right-hander in the American League, his major league career ended prematurely when a hunting accident in 1938 forced doctors to amputate his right leg. With a wooden leg and his wife Ethel's (June Allyson) help, Stratton made a successful minor league comeback in 1946, continuing to pitch in minor leagues throughout the rest of the 1940s and into the 1950s.
Monty Stratton was a successful pitcher for the Chicago White Sox in the 1930s. While trying out for the team in California, he meets his future wife Ethel on a blind date and they are soon married. His success is cut short however when his right leg has to be amputated as a result of a hunting accident. After a long rehabilitation, he starts to throw again, eventually making it back into professional baseball.
