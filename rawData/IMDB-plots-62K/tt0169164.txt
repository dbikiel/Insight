Looking back at stories and myths of an Italian small town in the mid-70s.
April 24, 1993: the last program of Radio Arrow is on the air. Over the microphone, Bruno tells the story of the radio station which is also the story of a group of friends. In the beginning the radio was called Radio Raptus but its name was changed into Radio Arrow after the body of Ivan Benassi, known as the arrow, was found half-immersed, head down, in a ditch. Jena, Boris and Tito are the friends with whom Arrow and Bruno spend most of their time. They consider the bar Laika as their own home and it's there that Adolfo, the barman, talks to them about privately-owned radio stations for the first time. All of them, individually, try to find their way to grow up or to remain forever young, through long days spent in the bar, love stories, small-town practical jokes and dramatic events.
