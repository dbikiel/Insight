An untested American submarine captain teams with U.S. Navy Seals to rescue the Russian president, who has been kidnapped by a rogue general.
A U.S. submarine, the USS Tampa Bay, vanishes while shadowing a Russian Akula-class submarine in the Arctic. Rear Admiral John Fisk sends a Virginia-class submarine, the USS Arkansas, under the command of newly-promoted and unorthodox Commander Joe Glass to investigate. At the same time, a Navy SEAL team under the command of Lieutenant Bill Beaman is sent in to discreetly observe a Russian naval base. When they arrive at the naval base, they witness defense minister Dmitri Durov conducting a coup d'etat and taking Russian President Zakarin prisoner, and swiftly realize that Durov intends to trigger a war..
When the USS Tampa Bay submarine that is navigating in Russian waters loses contact with the American base, Captain Joe Glass is assigned to command the USS Arkansas submarine to investigate. They discover the USS Tampa Bay and a Russian submarine sunk with survivors inside. However they are attacked by another Russian submarine hidden under an iceberg but they explode the enemy. Then they rescue the survivors, including the Russian Captain Andropov. Meanwhile a commando led by Lieutenant Bill Beaman is sent to observe a Russian base and they find that a coup d'Ã©tat is in progress with the defense minister Dmitriy Durov overthrowing the Russian President Nikolai Zakarin. Now Beaman and Glass are assigned to try to rescue Zakarin to avoid a nuclear war, but the only chance to the USS Arkansas reach the Russian base waters is with the help of Captain Andropov. Will he collaborate with Glass?
