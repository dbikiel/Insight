Stan and Ollie do battle with inanimate objects, their co-workers, and the laws of physics during a routine work day at the sawmill.
It's a typical day at the woodshop for Stanley and Oliver, getting jammed in windows, puncturing water pipes, getting stuck to glue brushes, having tiffs with their co-workers, and finally getting their car cut in half in a giant band-saw.
Without a care in the world, the cheerful duo of novice carpenters, Stan and Ollie--of all people--drive along a busy stretch of road on a sunny day, on their way to work at a sawmill. There, among a plethora of heavy and dangerous machinery, the boys get to play with tools, as one problem easily leads to another, and faith in their relationship is always put to the test. In the end, is carpentry Ollie and Stan's thing?
