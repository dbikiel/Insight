A story of a married couple with two children, whose housing problems, the man's infidelity and the woman's fragility lead the family to destruction.
Beata and Bartek are a young married couple with two children. As they keep waiting for the key to their own Warsaw apartment, they are living temporarily with Bartek's overbearing mother near Warsaw's Saviour Square. Problems arise when the developer who was supposed to build their apartment goes bankrupt. Financial difficulties coincide with family quarrels and Bartek's infidelity, which eventually lead the marriage to collapse.
The movie tells the story of a family, living together in Warsaw, next to the Saviour Square (Plac Zbawiciela). Based on facts, it relates the lives and relationship of three people - a wife, a husband and his mother. The action takes place around 2005. A young couple is about to move a new apartment in which they invested all their money. As the construction of the new building takes longer than scheduled, they decide to move temporarily to the house of the husband's mother. Couple of months later, the real estate developer goes bankrupt and the young couple is left with no money, no own home, and an unpayable loan at the bank. As the three characters starts slowly blaming and hating each other, the story turns into a "huis-clos" drama.
