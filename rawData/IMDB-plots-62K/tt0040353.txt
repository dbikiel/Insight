During World War II, an insubordinate fighter pilot finds the shoe on the other foot when he's promoted.
At an American air base in England, 1943, is conniving Sergeant Dolan, who manipulates everyone, and insubordinate ace fighter pilot Major Ed Hardin. When Ed is promoted to commander of his group, he must fight his former anti-authority stance as well as the enemy; tension grows as D-Day approaches. Generally lighthearted between moments of technicolor gore; lots of air combat footage, much of it genuine.
In England in 1943, the men of an 8th Army Air Corps fighter squadron bravely escort bomber missions over Europe. Their ace is Major Ed Hardin who has made a name for himself not only as a flyer but as one who is ready to break the rules if he thinks it will make a mark on the enemy or protect his men. When he is made the unit's commanding officer, he finds himself in constant conflict with his immediate superior Brig. Gen. Mel Gilbert. Meanwhile, the unit's Master Sergeant, James Dolan, is a wheeler- dealer and something of a ladies man whose exploits are now known far and wide.
