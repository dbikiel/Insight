Pusit is having the worst day of his life. He just lost his job and is in serious debt. That is all about to change when he receives a mysterious phone call with a tempting offer. If he could complete 13 tasks, he will win 100 million Baht. Pusit agrees and the game begins.
13: Game of death or 13 Beloved is a THAI horror comedy/psychological thriller movie, which focuses on a struggling and desperate salesman named Phuchit who loses his job in due course of time for not being productive in his performance and runs up enormous debts as a result of this accident. Shortly comes a turning point in Phuchit's life when he receives a mobile phone call made by some anonymous callers who urge him to partake in certain 13 spooky games. The games, that consecutively follow, become progressively challenging and detestable to test the patience of Phuchit. If he qualifies all of them successfully, he has the chance to win a whopping amount of money against every game, as the prize to be given by the callers. Regarding the offer as a fine way to restore his means, Phuchit reluctantly gives his consent to undertake the venturesome project only to give the remainder of the plot a sensational yet sinister turn.
