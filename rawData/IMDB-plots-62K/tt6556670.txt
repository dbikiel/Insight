Claude and Marie Verneuil face a new crisis. The four spouses of their daughters, David, Rachid, Chao and Charles decided to leave France for various reasons. Here they are imagining their lives elsewhere.
After Laure's blissful marriage in Qu'est-ce qu'on a fait au Bon Dieu? (2014), the multicultural family of the unconventional Verneuils faces yet another unforeseen crisis. Against the backdrop of ambitious business ideas in a France that is constantly changing, the ethnic sons-in-law--the Algerian, Rachid; the Jewish, David; the Chinese, Chao, and the Ivorian, Charles--are now planning to move abroad with their lovely wives, leaving the doting parents, Claude and Marie, all alone. And, as if that weren't enough, the Koffis, too, are in for a big surprise. Will the Verneuils take this situation lying down? Above all, will they ever learn how to trust their children, and stop worrying?
