Five years ago, Christine went after the baby she gave up for adoption, claiming he'd been stolen, and wound up killing Alex Williams' wife and the baby the Williams' had adopted. Now, Alex has remarried to a woman with a young son and when Christine escapes from a mental institution, she heads straight for Alex, looking for revenge.
A woman (Walker) who is mentally ill had a baby years ago. Her family decided that it would be in the child's best interest to give it up for adoption. She looked to get it back. When the husband (McCloskey) came home, he found his wife dead and the woman clutching her dead baby. She was sent to a mental hospital. A few years later, she escapes, and she wants revenge. The man who adopted her baby has since remarried a single mother (Francis), and they live in the same house. She assumes that their son is her baby, and gets a job at the coffee shop to wait for an opportunity to strike. The husband, learning of her escape, dreads what she would do.
