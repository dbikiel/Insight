Assorted wacky characters converge on a Chinese hotel to bid on a new invention, television.
Professor Wong has invented a television and invites everyone to see it at China's International House Hotel. Every time Tommy Nash attempts to wed his fiancée Carol Fortescue, he comes down with an illness, and when he breaks out in a rash, the hotel is quarantined. Into this hotel flies Professor Quail in his auto-gyro.
A Chinese scientist invents television, and Agents from all countries gather in the remote Chinese city of Wu-Hu to buy the rights. American Tommy Nash is in trouble with fiancée Carol because his illnesses keep postponing their wedding; playgirl Peggy evades jealous ex-husband Petronovich and pursues rich American Professor Quail. Much of the movie is comedy and musical acts from old-time radio, made visible by the "radioscope". Highlight: Cab Calloway performing "Reefer Man".
