A thriller set in turn-of-the-century Helsinki, Stolen Death uses elements of German expressionism to tell the story of Finnish resistance fighters smuggling arms to overthrow the Tsarist occupiers of Finland.

A World War One era group of revolutionists in the Scandinavian region prepare for military actions, but find this endeavor difficult as the times are hard and uncertain, their collaborators corrupt.
