Spartak Molodtsov is a man who can not pass through. Because of this he always gets into trouble.
Spartak Molodtsov - a man extremely accurate, irreconcilable to any mess. Finding once the torn wire of the high-voltage line, he, of course, could not pass by. But, as you know, "no good deed goes unpunished" - now Spartak is late for work, his beloved sister is going to move out, and the incredibly active Georgian is trying to give him a bribe. Moreover, no one is going to repair the wire .
