When Blondie mistakes a gold watch Dagwood carries home as her anniversary gift, it leads Dagwood into trouble with his boss, a loan shark, and crooked building contractors.
Dagwood's boss gives him an expensive wrist watch to deliver to the secretary of a bank as a gift, thereby hoping she will help influence the bank president to give him a big construction contract. Dagwood takes it home, planning to deliver it the next day. Blondie opens it and thinks it is a gift for their wedding anniversary.Not having the heart to tell her otherwise, DAgwood lets her keep it and he buys a cheap one to give to the secretary. The switch is discovered and Dagwood is fired (for the578th time counting Sunday newspaper comic section.) Blondie to the rescue.
