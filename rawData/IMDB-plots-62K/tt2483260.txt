When Zarina steals Pixie Hollow's Blue Pixie Dust and flies away, Tinker Bell and her friends sets on a journey to get them back.
When a misunderstood dust-keeper fairy named Zarina steals Pixie Hollow's all-important Blue Pixie Dust, and flies away to join forces with the pirates of Skull Rock, Tinker Bell and her fairy friends must embark on the adventure of a lifetime to return it to its rightful place. However, in the midst of their pursuit of Zarina, Tink's world is turned upside down. She and her friends find that their respective talents have been switched and they have to race against time to retrieve the Blue Pixie Dust and return home to save Pixie Hollow.
Mesmerised by the sparkling Blue Pixie Dust and thrilled by its magical power, the inquisitive and ambitious dust-keeper fairy, Zarina, finds herself neck-deep into trouble when she starts experimenting with the mystical powder. Almost one year later and far away from the colourful Pixie Hollow, Zarina is now a pirate-fairy and a member of Skull Rock's intimidating corsairs, unbeknownst to her that Tinker Bell and her loyal friends--Silvermist, Iridessa, Fawn, Vidia, and Rosetta--have set off to find her. Now, with an unforeseen change of talents, can the little sprites outsmart the young cabin boy, James Hook, and the rest of the crew?
