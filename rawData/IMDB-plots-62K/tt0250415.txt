Raj is a struggling singer with big dreams who is still waiting for his big break. One night he witnesses an accident where a car spins out of control and lands on the tracks of an on-coming train. Raj runs over to the wreckage and rescues the occupant just in time. He takes her to the hospital and the girl's family are informed. The girl, Pooja Oberoi, survives but is in a vigil coma, a condition whereby she can hear and see everything but cannot speak nor move any part of her body. The Oberoi family is grateful to Raj and are led to believe that he is Pooja's groom, Romi. Raj is reluctant to accept this but then he changes his mind and accepts being the groom, as he has an agenda of his own and takes advantage of this accident to further his goals. But then he meets Pooja's best friend Jahnvi and falls in love with her. The situation is complicated even more when Pooja wakes up from the coma and begins to show feelings for Raj.
