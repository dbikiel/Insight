Fonda and Redford star as Addie Moore and Louis Waters, a widow and widower who've lived next to each other for years. The pair have almost no relationship, but that all changes when Addie tries to make a connection with her neighbor.
In Holt, a small Colorado town, Addie Moore (Jane Fonda) pays an unexpected visit to a neighbor, Louis Waters (Robert Redford). Her husband died years ago, as did his wife, and in such a small town they'd been neighbors for decades, but had little contact. Their children (Matthias Schoenaerts and Judy Greer) live far away and they are all alone in their big houses. Addie seeks to establish a connection, and make the most of the rest of the time they have.
After losing her husband, a small town widow Addie (Fonda) asks her fellow neighbor and widower Louis (Redford) if he would like to sleep next to her at night, to ease their loneliness. As their friendship grows, they become involved in each others lives and those of their friends and family.
