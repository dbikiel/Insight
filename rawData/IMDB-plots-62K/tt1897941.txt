Naka Riisa will play a 24-year-old woman named Mitsuko who is 9 months pregnant to an unknown father, but still puts aside her own problems to help others. Her character is described as having a deep sense of duty and humanity, traits which are getting less and less common in modern society. The hope is that Mitsuko's disposition will tug at the heartstrings of Japanese audiences much like the Tora-san character did through the Showa era. Nakamura Aoi will play Mitsuko's childhood friend, Yoichi.
