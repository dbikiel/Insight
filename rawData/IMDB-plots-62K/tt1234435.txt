The year is 2013 and, with the abolition of the death penalty, prisons are overflowing across the globe presenting a major problem for the authorities. The solution is to ship a consignment of them to a far-flung, freezing god-forsaken place and let them colonize it. When they find themselves deposited at their new home, the authorities leave a pile of numbered keys with which to unlock their chains, and then retreat to a safe distance. All hell breaks loose and among scenes of carnage, the Russians kill the Chechens with uncontrolled acts of murderous violence.
