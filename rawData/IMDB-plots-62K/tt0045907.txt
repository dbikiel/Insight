Confronted with the unfortunate news that their favorite Streetcar, no. 133, is going to be decommissioned, two Municipal Transit workers get drunk and decide to "take 'er for one last spin," as it were. Unfortunately, the "one last spin" ends up being an all-night and all-day scramble to stay out of trouble, as they are confronted with situation after sometimes bizarre situation that prevents them from returning the "borrowed" Streetcar!
In the 50's, in Mexico, the streetcar mechanic Juan Godinez and the pilot Tarrajas become upset when they are informed by their supervisor that the streetcar number 133 will be decommissioned. They go to a party and late night, they get drunk and decide to borrow the streetcar for one last spin for fun, without charging the passengers. Completely wasted, they sleep in the streetcar and on the next morning, they get in troubled and weird situations while trying to return the vehicle to the garage.
