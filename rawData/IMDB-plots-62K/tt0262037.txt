A neurotic Sri Lankan patient crashes his psychotherapist's family vacation in Kodaikanal.
Thenali (Kamal) is a traumatized Sri Lankan Tamil, who is beset by a variety of elaborate phobias. A psychiatrist Panchabhootam (Delhi Ganesh), convinced that Thenali is impossible, refers him to rival shrink Kailash (Jayaram). The doctor takes an instant dislike to his new patient, while his wife (Devyani) and sister (Jyothika) take more of a liking to him than Kailash would like.
