Ex-con Rocky Mulloy seeks the real culprit in the crime for which he was framed in a night world of deceptive dames and double crosses.
Rocky Mulloy, back in town after serving 5 years of a life sentence for armed robbery, hopes to clear his friend Danny Morgan who's still in prison for the same crime. It won't be easy. Even the witness who cleared Rocky thinks he's guilty; Danny's glamorous wife Nancy, living in a sleazy trailer court, seems lukewarm about getting Danny back; cynical cop Gus Cobb just wants to stir things up in hopes that the missing "hot" $100,000 will surface. Plenty of tough talk, night scenes, deceptive dames and double crosses in this typical film noir.
"Rocky" Mulloy is framed for a murder and a holdup he didn't commit and pulls a five year stretch in prison. He is finally pardoned when a friend returns from overseas to corroborate his testimony in court. "Rocky" then goes hunting for the real culprits so this his prison buddy, believed to be innocent, can also be pardoned. Nancy Morgan, wife of his friend, falls in love with him along the way, and he also has a few bullets fired at him by an oily character. "Rocky" finds the guilty party in a place he didn't think about looking.
