A guy starts a fake casting agency in hopes that he will meet his soul mate.
In Los Angeles, three guys with limited social lives hatch a plan to meet women: they'll issue a casting call for an independent film, interview actresses, and ask out the ones who interest them. Glenn is a nerd, but he has the office. Sherman has the idea - he's a hound, happy to lie, eager to meet and bed as many women as he can fool. Richie, who owns the camera, hopes to meet his true love. Within a few days, he's fallen for Marina Dell, new in town, with a boyfriend back east; Glenn is ga-ga for Laurel, and Sherman can't say no to the eager and adventurous Nikita. But how long can they sustain the fiction, and what about real feelings?
