The happy tranquility of Buggsville is shattered when the populace learns that a colossal skyscraper is to be built over their tiny town.
In a vacant corner lot off Broadway (by about a yard) is a place called the Lowlands by the tiny community that lives there. Bugs and insects are neighbors and hang out at the Honey Shop of old Mr. Bumble the bee and his daughter Honey. Hoppity the grasshopper arrives to be with Honey, his sweetie. This bugs the crooked C. Bagley Beetle, so do his bunglers Smack the Mosquito and Swat the Fly. The Beetle wants Honey and the Lowlands for himself. But the Human Ones, with their littering and carelessness, pose a threat of destruction to every Lowland home of bug and beetle alike. Despite the doomsaying of Mr. Creeper, the snail, Hoppity finds hope of a new home behind the house of two Human Ones: Mary, who cares for a beautiful garden; and Dick, a struggling songwriter who puts his own hope on a Broadway hit to save his home.
Hoppity the grasshopper finds that all is not well when he returns home to the lowlands, a vacant lot just 45 inches from Broadway. A skyscraper is scheduled to be built on the site, throwing all his friends and relatives from their homes. Not only that, his girlfriend Honey Bee is being forced to marry the villainous C. Bagley Beetle. All will be saved if only Dick and Mary, the songwriting humans who own the land, can find the money to build the home of their dreams, thereby also providing a new home for the lowlands residents. But Beetle has other ideas and, with the help of his bumbling but hearts-of-gold henchmen Swat and Smack, intercepts Dick's hefty royalty check.
