Movie buff and hamburger waitress Alice Goodbody sleeps her way to Stardom via encounters with the cast and crew of a rock-musical movie. It's a bumpy-road for Alice, however, because of a series of comic mishaps on the set.
A classic, wild 70's R-rated sex comedy. Movie-nut hamburger waitress Alice Goodbody (Sharon Kelly - star of Supervixens) sleeps her way to Stardom via encounters with crew and cast of a rock-musical movie. It's a bumpy-road for Alice, however, because of a series of comic mishaps on the set. A ribald romp that Roger Corman called, "Hilarious! The funniest, truest take on Hollywood -- EVER!"
