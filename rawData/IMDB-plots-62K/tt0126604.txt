A talented young photographer, who enjoys snapping photos of his satirical, perverted Baltimore neighborhood and his wacky family, gets dragged into a world of pretentious artists from New York City and finds newfound fame.
A Baltimore sandwich shop employee becomes an overnight sensation when a photographer's photos he's taken of his weird family become the latest rage in the art world.
A young adult named Pecker, who works at a sandwich shop/deli by day, takes pictures of his dysfunctional family, the crazy residents of Baltimore, places and even things around the city. One day at his own art show at the shop, New York art dealer Rorey Wheeler buys one of Pecker's "modern pictures" and invites girlfriend Shelley, a laundromat worker, common thief/best friend Matt, parents Jimmy and Joyce a struggling bartender/bar owner and bargain clothing store saleswoman, daughter Tina a hostess/bartender at a gay strip joint, their sugar-crazed young daughter Chrissy, and the family's religious grandmother called "Memama", a "pit beef" sandwich chef, to an art gallery in New York City. It is then that Pecker becomes an overnight art sensation nationwide. Unfortunately, serious problems arise back home. Many of the residents become appalled and embarrassed by his pictures, costing him a whole lot more than his friends. It's up to Pecker to make things right with his Shelley and make the people see the good from bad in photography.
