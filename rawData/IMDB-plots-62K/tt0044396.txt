When the Texas cattle trails to Kansas are blocked, cattle buyer Gene Autry (Gene Autry) goes to Texas to investigate. There, he finds his friend, land-agent "Buckeye" Buttram (Pat Buttram)and pretty Gay Kendall (Anne James, a newspaper reporter, siding with the homesteaders in a rancher-settlers dispute instigated by speculator Steve Ruttledge (Leonard Penn), in a land-grab scheme in which he will benefit when the railroad is built across the land he hopes to control.
Cattle are not getting through to the railheads in Kansas and Gene has been sent down to Texas to investigate. There he finds the squatters have fenced off the range land with barbed wire. Unable to get the ranchers together, he stages the fake funeral of a leading rancher. Once assembled he gets the ranchers to agree to a large cattle drive. But Ruttledge has paid the squatters to fence the land figuring a railroad will have to be built letting him sell the land at a profit. Now he plans to stop the drive.
