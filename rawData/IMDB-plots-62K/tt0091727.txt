A teenage boy takes a job as a counselor at a summer camp. He finds that the camp is run like a military training camp, and he resolves to turn it into Party Central.
Camp counselor and party animal Jerry Riviera (Andrew Ross) has seen the girl of his dreams in Heather Morris (Kerry Brennan) at summer camp. Unfortunately, the strict regimen of his camp experience is not what he imagined. So, with the help of his group of young misfit campers, wiseguy Riviera sets out to buck authority and turn the experience into a non-stop party-like atmosphere.
