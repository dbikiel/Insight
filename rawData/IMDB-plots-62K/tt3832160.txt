A writer falls in love with a woman whose traditional family ties interfere with her life.
When Jack gets rescued by Maria, a superstitious Portuguese beauty, he has no idea that his life and luck are both about to change. During this accidental "first date", Jack and Maria project idealistic images of themselves -- images that are humorously contradicted through a series of flash-forwards to their future life together.
