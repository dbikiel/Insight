To prove his theory that rock and roll is on its way out, a sociologist tries to convince a "bop" singer to switch to calypso, much to the ire of her Hollywood nightclub manager.
The action takes place in a college town where there seems to be an amazing number of night clubs featuring rock and roll entertainment (the Bop in the title). Professor Winthrop (Lucien Littlefield) hangs out at Barney's nightclub (George O'Hanlon). Jo Thomas (Judy Tyler) is the lead singer of the house band. The professor is mentoring a new young professor, Robert Hilton (Bobby Troup). Dr. Hilton is trying to publish a thesis on crowds and fads. He has a machine which will measure the excitement in a club. He takes his machine to all the clubs which helps us see Nino Tempo, Mary Kaye's Trio (Hawaiian humor!) and other groups. He has found that rock and roll is on the way out and calypso will be the next big thing. He verbally spars with Jo over this and gets in a fist fight with Barney. Jo agrees to go to a calypso club with him where Lord Flea puts on a show. She is moved to come up with calypso numbers with her band. Meanwhile, she is falling for the young professor while he is dealing with his fiancee who wants to get married and make a genetically perfect baby in the next week. All turns out well when Jo's calypso number is a big hit at Barney's club.
