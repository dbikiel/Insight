Two gamecocks are fighting inside a wire cage, while two spectators look on in the background. The two men agree to make a bet on the outcome. One of them shows his money to the other, who is commenting on the fight.
A stationary camera observes two fighting cocks on a raised platform, with chicken wire behind them. On the far side of the chicken wire are two men, on either side of the frame. We see just the head of the man on our left and the head and chest of the man on our right, who is clearly in charge. Money changes hands twice as the cocks fight. Feathers fly. The man on our right points and shakes his finger. Both cocks are still standing when the film ends.
