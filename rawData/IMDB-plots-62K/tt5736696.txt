A clumsy girl dreams about joining to an elite special forces team.
The story of a woman who dreams to join an intervention group in the police department called RAID. Unfortunately, she is rather clumsy and both her family (and soon to be family-in-law) and a veteran of the RAID do not approve. However, Johanna is determined to prove them wrong.
Johanna Pasquali is the first woman to join the RAID elite group. With the agent Eugene Froissard, the most misogynist of the agents of RAID, this improbable duo is entrusted to stop the Gang of the Leopards. But before stopping them, they would have to work in pairs without killing each other.
