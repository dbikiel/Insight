Born in a tribe of fierce warrior women, the archer and sword fighter, Hundra, has been raised to despise the influence of men. Superior to any male, Hundra takes a vow of revenge until one day she finds love.
It's the Dark Ages, and savage men enslave all women, but except for one woman who was born in a tribe of fierce warrior women Hundra the Invincible has been raised to despise the influence of men. Her name is Hundra, the finest warrior of her people. Hundra seeks out her elder, she leads a valiant tribe of women who dares to be free.
In a dark age of violence--where men made the laws, and women only lived to obey them--Hundra, the fearless leader of a free tribe of valiant women, comes face-to-face with the vile nature of man. As the sole survivor of a blood-soaked raid, the dauntless she-warrior embarks on a dangerous quest of retribution against the oppressive male masters, refusing to bow down to no one, especially the odious barbarians. Now, the gleaming sword of the all-powerful blonde hunter of men thirsts for revenge, and no force on Earth can stand in Hundra's way; however, she's about to meet her match in the person of an unexpected adversary. Can the untamed female executor avenge all women?
