Twisted, apocalyptic satire, THIS IS NOT A MOVIE envisions the end of the world through the bi-polar mind of a strung-out pop-culture addict. Starring Edward Furlong and Peter Coyote, with a jagged, atmospheric score from Slash.
With the end of the world imminent, Pete Nelson (Edward Furlong) locks himself inside a Las Vegas hotel. There, he tries to understand his confused reality influenced by film,TV, pop culture, disinformation, drugs and propaganda. The journey that follows is a surreal, psychedelic, apocalyptic quest where nothing is what it seems... THIS IS NOT A MOVIE.
