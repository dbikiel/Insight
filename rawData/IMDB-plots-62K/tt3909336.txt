In modern Greece, while socioeconomic turmoil ravages Southern Europe, three distinct stories unfold, each representing a different generation of Greeks in love with a foreigner, each story coming together in the end to form a whole.
In a restless Athens against the backdrop of Greece's socio-economic collapse, three vivid stories of intercultural romance intertwine, depicting the turmoil and the inner sadness of a country amid a ceaseless explosion of immigration and financial meltdown. In this colourful triptych of love, the Syrian refugee, Farris, saves a damsel in distress, the idealist college student, Daphne, as a seemingly endless wave of fervent nationalism spreads in town. Then, in the following segment, Giorgos, an unhappily-married, pill-popping sales manager, delves deep into an unexpected affair with Elise, the frigidly beautiful Scandinavian corporate executive. Finally, Maria, a wistful Greek housewife whose family is struggling to keep afloat, has a fateful encounter with the retired German expatriate, Sebastian, who offers Maria a second chance in love before the well-stocked aisles of a local supermarket. In the end, can love transcend all barriers?
