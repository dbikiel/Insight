Some day, her prince charming at the wheel of one of those big machines, will dismount his modern steed and take her away, over the rainbow. So she runs and runs along the road, in red shorts,too tight as she turns into a young woman, trying to tempt one of those modern knights. One night, one of them does notice her. He is good-looking but Catherine soon realizes that he is also a drunk and a violent pervert. The dream turns into a scary nightmare...
