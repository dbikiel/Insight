China Blue takes us inside a blue-jeans factory, where Jasmine and her friends are trying to survive a harsh working environment. When the factory owner agrees to a deal with his Western client that forces his teenage workers to work around the clock, a confrontation becomes inevitable. Shot clandestinely in China, under difficult conditions, this is a deep-access account of what both China and the international retail companies don't want us to see - how the clothes we buy are actually made.
