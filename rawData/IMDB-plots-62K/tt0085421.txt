The historic saga of Russia's first industrialists. The main plot of the first season is the story of the Demidovas and Peter the first's mutual relationship. In a short time following Peter Akinfii Demidov's command, the problems with the cast iron and cannon industry was sorted which allowed Russia to secure a string of historic victories. The second season's events unfold in the time-period of Tsarina Anna Ioannova when Demidov Akinfii becomes absolute ruler of the Urals after having managed to oppose harsh and cunning ruler Biron.
In 1700 Peter the Great was crushingly defeated under Narva. Almost a half of the Army was lost. All artillery went over to the Swedes. The country needed a prompt industrial reconstruction, new and higher quality guns and canons. The Tsar summoned all armourers and asked who would take it up for a small price, for the treasury was empty. Only one armourer Nikita Demidov volunteered to help, but asked for his pains one small plant in the Urals, where there was the best ironstone. He got the permission, and soon after the Russian Army started getting excellent guns and canons, and the talented armourer became the one of the most powerful Russian manufacturers.
