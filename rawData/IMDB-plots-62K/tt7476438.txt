When a family of five rent a beautiful house for their summer vacation, the price seems too good to be true.
When a family of five rent a beautiful house for their summer vacation, the price seems too good to be true. Unbeknownst to them, the lascivious owner has set up a series of spy cams throughout the house, documenting their most intimate moments and live streaming them to the dark web.
With his seemingly ideal rental properties crammed with unseen spy cameras, the lascivious landlord, Gerald, lures an unwitting family of five in one of his houses in the middle of nowhere. Picking up where he left off in Slumlord (2015), the creepy voyeur has now stepped up his game, selling a live stream on the Dark Net. Once more, the grotesque superintendent from Hell invades the private lives of his unsuspecting victims, and, this time, he craves more: an equally depraved audience. What will it take to stop the pervert?
