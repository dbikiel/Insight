In a traditional "magician" attire complete with a black robe and a pointy hat, the wizard of illusion and jump cuts, Georges Méliès, says the magic words, and out of thin air, he conjures up a plain wooden box atop an ordinary table. Unexpectedly, the illusionist jumps into the box, and a comical and famished Pierrot emerges, only to give place to a bearded sculptor, ready to put the finishing touches on a life-like female bust. Suddenly, a beautiful woman appears. Is she real or is she a delightful mirage?
In this scene is shown a magician behind an ordinary table, upon which he suddenly and mysteriously causes to appear a large box, into which he leaps. The sides of the box fall to the ground, but instead of containing the magician a lively clown steps forth who further mystifies the audience by causing the box to disappear, and in its place is seen a fully laid table with a smoking dinner, to which the clown applies himself. The table, however, suddenly disappears much to the astonishment of the clown, who is confronted by the magician in the garb of Mephistopheles. This he suddenly changes to that of a sculptor, and in the background is seen a pedestal with the bust of a young lady, which comes to life as the sculptor applies the mallet and chisel.
