A brokenhearted woman teams up with her ex-boyfriend to try and stop the hitman she accidentally hired to kill him.
Harper and Ray, who have been dating for over two years, break up after Ray flatly turns down what was supposed to be Harper's romantic proposal of marriage. Emerging from a drunken stupor in the middle of the night following the proposal and break up, Harper believes she may have placed an online ad to hire a hit man to kill Ray in a "paper clip" trade - the trade being the engagement ring she bought for herself for Ray to give to her - some unknown person who responds to the ad. Harper has no way of contacting the person, who only knows Ray's given name and her cell phone number and email address. Concerned for Ray's safety, she immediately tells him what she did. Ray is at first unconcerned, until he discovers how much the responder may know about about them and how close geographically he actually is to where he lives. They hope for the best but fear for the worst as they begin to suspect any little thing out of the ordinary is the hit man's doing, and as they prepare themselves against an attack. But in their time together during this precarious time, Harper and Ray may have a chance to dissect their relationship and admit their true feelings in their end of life thoughts.
