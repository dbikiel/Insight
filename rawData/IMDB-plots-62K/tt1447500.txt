A bike stuntman recalls his previous life as a warrior, and pursues his love's reincarnation. A sinister figure from their shared past threatens to separate them forever.
In 1609 AD, Mitravinda, a princess, and Kala Bhairava, the warrior that she loved, die. 400 years later, the warrior is reincarnated as Harsha, a motorcycle stuntman. He brushes hands with a girl and sparks fly as he begins to recall his past life. Knowing that he is destined to love this young woman, he sets about trying to identify her. Indu does not remember her past life and keeps Harsha at a distance; playing tricks on him until she gets to know him better. However, just as the two begin to fall in love, a sinister force from their shared past returns!
