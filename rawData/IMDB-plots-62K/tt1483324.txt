Two parents fall in love over the course of a single day while playing hooky from their children's college tour.
EDITH MARTIN (Vera Farmiga) is a strong-willed, free-spirited and successful businesswoman whos taking her hyper-achieving, 18 year-old daughter AUDREY (Taissa Farmiga) on a tour of potential colleges.GEORGE HARTMAN (Andy Garcia) is a buttoned-up heart surgeon accompanying his not-very motivated son CONRAD (Spencer Lofranco), on a similar tour.Their paths cross at idyllic Middleton College, nestled in the picturesque Pacific Northwest. At first, all things point to this being the kids story but it quickly becomes clear that Edith and George are the heart and center of the film.As the campus tour gets underway, and their well-intentioned support turns clumsy in the extreme, Edith and George not only embarrass their kids, but are soon told by them essentially to take a hike.Now banished together, these two time-pressed, responsible adults suddenly find themselves with a free day in the midst of a beautiful setting and the hours they subsequently share change their lives as they play out a unique college tour all their own.Equal parts charming and funny, "Middleton" is about letting go and coming together the story of two people who, through a remarkable, unexpected connection, are able to glimpse the potential that true romance can offer. As Edith and George eventually realize in ways both hilarious and heartbreaking, their adventure proves to be the greatest half-day of their lives.
