A pulsing, kaleidoscope of images set to an energetic soundtrack. A young women swings in a garden; a woman's face smiles. The rest is spinning cylinders, pistons, gears and turbines, kitchen objects in concentric circles or rows - pots, pan lids, and funnels, cars passing overhead, a spinning carnival ride. Over and over, a heavy-set woman climbs stairs carrying a large bag on her shoulder. An Art Deco cartoon figure appears, dancing. This is a world in motion, dominated by mechanical and repetitive images, with a few moments of solitude in a garden.
The detail of a mouth, rotating mechanical objects, a girl who goes on a swing in a reverse frame to reality. Human movement is camouflaged in mechanics and imitates cumbersome movements. The forms are alchemically mutated and broken by subversive geometries. A figure decomposed in cubes moves with a stick.
