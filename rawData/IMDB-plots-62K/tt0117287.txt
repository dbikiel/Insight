Gunther Wheeler, fourteen, a tough guy from New York City, moves to a small town called Pleasant Valley. Gunther isn't making very many friends in his new town. Until he meets Allison Robbins a beautiful blonde girl his age, the girl of his dreams. Gunther is anxious to score on Allison by taking her out on a date. When Chad, Luke, and Wylie, a couple of neighborhood bullies give Gunther a chance to see Screamin' Banchees, an awesome band, but the tickets for the concert are one hundred fifty dollars. Gunther doesn't have that kind of money. So the only way for him to get the money is to work as a paperboy with Charlie, Gus, Henry, and Fish, which are known as the "nerd herd".
A 14 year old boy named Gunther moves to a small town with his parents and little brother. He meets up with a group of overly charitable paper boys who want him to sub for their friend while he's out of town. Gunther agrees so he can get enough money for concert tickets to take his blonde and beautiful crush too, all the while dealing with Chad, her wannabe boyfriend and his bully friends. All in all, Gunther learns to respect himself and other people and to have fun during it all.
