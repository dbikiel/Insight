In 1718 a recently freed family of indentured workers inherits the small uninhabited Bull Island off the Carolina coast. The family consist of husband and wife, one son, and a second son who they bought as a baby. The local fishermen who were already using the island think they own the island and attempt to force the family to leave, during which the husband is killed. The conflict over the island escalates as more people including a castaway, a fugitive from justice, and hired heavies join each side. Not everyone is who they seem to be or claim to be.
Bonnett was a real buccaneer in the early 18th Century, known as "The Gentleman Pirate" both for his taste in fine clothes and his reputed kindness to the women that he robbed. Here Bonnett is less refined, but he's still coming to the aid of a besieged widow and her family while marooned on an island by his mutinous crew.
