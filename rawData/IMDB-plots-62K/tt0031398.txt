In 19th century India, three British soldiers and a native waterbearer must stop a secret mass revival of the murderous Thuggee cult before it can rampage across the land.
Based loosely on the poem by Rudyard Kipling, this takes place in British India during the Thuggee uprising. Three fun loving sergeants are doing fine until one of them wants to get married and leave the service. The other two trick him into a final mission where they end up confronting the entire cult by themselves as the British Army is entering a trap. This is of the "War is fun" school of movie making. It has the flavour of watching Notre Dame play an inferior high school team.
Born in British India, Gunga Din always wanted to join the British army like many of his fellow Indians, but was not allowed to do so. So he starts observing them and learns accordingly. He befriends Sgt. Archibald Cutter, and warns him about a Thuggee uprising that may threaten their base. Sgt. Cutter and others are able to fend off the attack, but when Gunga gets information of a much larger rebel attack, Cutter accompanies him to the cult's temple embedded with gold statues of Hindu deities. Gunga finds out he is regarded as a traitor by his countrymen, and Cutter, as well as Sergeants MacChesney and Ballantine are held captive by the Thuggees in a bid to force the British to leave India.
