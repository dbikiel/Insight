En route to Hollywood, singer Steve, his partner Seymour and fiancée Jane, Jane's airheaded roommate Irma, and Irma's con artist fiancé Al have a series of misadventures and end up involved with a murderous gang.
In this sequel film, all the characters remain the same; Al is still unemployed, Jane still has show-biz aspirations for boyfriend Steve; Steve and Seymour are still partners, and Irma is still Irma, which isn't all that easy. Al gets Steve a singing job on television, which is seen by a Hollywood producer. He signs Steve to a long term movie contract, and all hands depart for Hollywood. But, alas, the producer turns out to be an escaped lunatic, and they end up in Las Vegas, where Irma manages to get kidnapped by gangsters, who are very unhappy with Irma.
A delusional escaped mental patient convinces crooner Steve Laird that he's a Hollywood producer and signs him to a bogus studio contract. A jubilant Steve and his entourage; friend Seymour, con-artist agent Al, fiance Jane, and Jane's room mate Irma, the prototypical dumb blonde, speed across the country to California. They learn the truth before finishing their journey in Las Vegas, but not before Steve becomes entangled with a sexy French actress, Seymour gets involved with a chimpanzee, Al goes into the rug business with a millionaire Indian, and Irma is kidnapped by gangsters after she inadvertently sabotages one of their rigged roulette wheels.
