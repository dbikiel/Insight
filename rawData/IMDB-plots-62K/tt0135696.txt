Much to our amazement, an elegant and masterful illusionist detaches his own head effortlessly from his shoulders for a once-in-a-lifetime performance.
One of the greatest of black art pictures. The conjurer appears before the audience, with his head in its proper place. He then removes his head, and throwing it in the air, it appears on the table opposite another head, and both detached heads sing in unison. The conjurer then removes it a third time. You then see all three of his heads, which are exact duplicates, upon the table at one time, while the conjurer again stands before the audience with his head perfectly intact, singing in unison with the three heads upon the table. He closes the picture by bowing himself from the stage.
Much to our amazement, an elegant gentleman stands before an enthralled audience, between two ordinary wooden tables. Then, as if by magic, the masterful illusionist detaches his own head effortlessly from his shoulders, placing it on the table where it starts conversing with another identical head. Before long, the talented magician sprouts four indistinguishable heads out of his shoulders for a once-in-a-lifetime performance that will leave you wanting for more.
