A womanizer is falsely diagnosed with AIDS by a jealous lover and falls in love with a woman equally suicidal as he.
Yuppie and womanizer Tomas is caught in a trap when falsely diagnosed with A.I.D.S. by Silvia, a nurse who finds herself cheated by the young Casanova. Looking for a quick death (putting his head into a microwave oven) Tomas falls in love with Clarisa, a beautiful stewardess who is also suicidal because her boyfriend is having a love affair with a blonde stewardess from Continental Airlines.
