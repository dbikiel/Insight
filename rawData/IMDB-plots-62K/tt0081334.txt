A psychiatrist involved in a radical new therapy comes under suspicion when his patients are murdered, each according to their individual phobias.
A psychiatrist treats his patients - sufferers from agoraphobia, claustrophobia, acrophobia, a fear of snakes, and a fear of man - with radical therapy in which they confront their fears by watching them on a large screen. The result is that each patient is driven to commit violent acts, and each dies by what he most fears.
