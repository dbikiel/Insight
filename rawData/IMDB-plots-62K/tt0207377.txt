Secret Service agents must retrieve the briefcase allowing the President control of America's nuclear arsenal before massive destruction ensues.
Connelly, a secret service agent whose contempt for the new president's morals makes him unwilling to take a bullet for the guy is transferred to 'football duty'. The football in question is the briefcase which gives the president control over the whole of America's nuclear arsenal. It must be kept within 40 feet of him at all times and officers guarding it have responsibility only for the briefcase. However, during unofficial negotiations with a prominent Chinese businessman both the president and the football are captured.
