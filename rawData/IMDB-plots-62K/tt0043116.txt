Andy Clark discovers he was cheated out of a half interest in partner Mike's business, now a thriving dance hall in 1892 Chicago. Unable to win it back, Andy schemes to make Mike's position untenable. He also hopes to turn Ruby Summers, Mike's motor-mouthed burlesque queen, into a classier entertainer, and incidentally to make her his own. But at the last minute, Andy's revenge comes unravelled.
See the plot of 1943 movie "Coney Island", also with Betty Grable. This is a remake. In fact it's an exact remake. Just change the stars and their names in the picture, other than that it is the same story. It continues the old Hollywood tradition; never make anything new when a remake of an old money maker is much easier.
