Set in the "not-so-distant future", the crew of an international space station are set to return triumphantly to Earth, until someone starts killing the other crew members.
I would just like to add that this was a 2 part mini-series on Showtime. The first part was really interesting and the second part was a let-down. I believe it was the first made for cable movie that Showtime ever created. This was also the first time I ever saw Wilford Brimley but Michael Ironside was very familiar to me.
