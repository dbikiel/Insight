Using the same rocking effect previously employed in "Combat naval en Grèce (1897)", the director Georges Méliès recreates the illusion of a small ship in a tempest.
About a half dozen passengers, a clergyman, a captain and boson are aboard a sea tossed vessel. As it lurches several of the passengers are sea-sick and throwing up into bowls held by other passengers. Meanwhile a male passenger downs a drink. When the seas get even rougher the most of the passengers head below. The clergyman, however, is knocked off his feet and falls through a hatchway. As he tries to get back on deck the tossing becomes even more turbulent causing most to lose their footing. All go below except for the captain who has stayed at his post throughout this whole event.
Using the same rocking effect previously employed in "Combat naval en Grèce (1897)", the director Georges Méliès recreates the illusion of a small ship in a tempest with the use of this new technique and a graphic scenic design. Inevitably, as the vessel rocks from side to side, some of the passengers roll over and over, some get sea-sick, while others seek refuge inside. In the end, even though this is a rather busy scene, this obviously staged actuality makes an attempt to incorporate elements of early cinematic comedy in this wonderfully lively farce.
