Based on the autobiographical novel by Cielo Latini, the film tells the story of a teenager who falls in love and starts dating an older man whom she met on the Internet. Submerged in a shallow world, without any friends and with adults who can barely understand the adolescence, the relationship becomes an obsession for her, a loquacious, incisive and dizzying narrator who guides us through a story of unrequited love where the option of starving herself becomes the illusion of a perfect life.
