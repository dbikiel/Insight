A burglar reflects on his life and loves; while the media speculates how he managed to pull off so many heists.
Inspired by the incredible true story of Lucky Singh, an extremely charismatic and fearless confidence man and thief who socialized with the rich, famous and influential of Delhi society and then proceeded to rob them blind. He was the bÃªte noire of the police and had stolen millions by the time he was caught. A modern day Robin Hood with a twist, he robbed both the rich and the poor without prejudice. Nothing was too big nor was anything too insignificant to escape his attention. The film opens with his trial and charts his rise from the projects of crime ridden suburban Delhi to the very heart of the corridors of power. Along the way he makes lifelong friends, falls in love an manages to outwit the entire law and order machinery.
Arrested by Special Crime Branch Inspector Devender Singh, Lovinder Singh reflects upon his life: his childhood, his father's second marriage, his siblings; his entry into crime and association with Gogi Arora; his romance with and subsequent marriage with the lovely Sonal; and his subsequent betrayal by his buddy and a business partner. Meanwhile the media speculates on how he got away with stealing 140 TV sets, 212 Video cassette recorders, 475 shirts, 90 music systems, 50 jewelery boxes, 2 dogs, and a greeting card - in a spree of burglaries that included households in Bangalore, Chandigarh, Mumbai, and other cities in India.
