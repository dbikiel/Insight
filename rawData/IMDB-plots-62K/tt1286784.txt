Vincke and Verstuyft are detectives of the Antwerp police department. This time they have to deal with the Albanian mob and some problems in their own police division.
DOSSIER K. is the long anticipated successor to 'The Alzheimer Case' which won numerous awards and was sold to over 30 countries, among which the US (where it was released through Sony Picture Classics). This second film based on a novel by Jef Geeraerts is a dense European thriller about passion, betrayal, revenge, blind ambition and the inevitability of fate. Set against the realistic background of Albanian mafia in Antwerp, the story brings the main characters Erik Vincke and Freddy Verstuyft into a disastrous vortex from which no one seems to escape.
