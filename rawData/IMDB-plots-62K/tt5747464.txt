A short comedy by the Coen brothers which was planned to be a part of an anthology film To Each His Own Cinema, but wasn't included in the final version of the film. A Texas cowboy goes to a movie-theater where he can't decide what non-American movie to watch and asks a ticket seller to suggest him a decent one.
