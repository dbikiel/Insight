A destitute woman (Cruz) becomes involved with an upper-crust physician (Castellitto).
While waiting for the brain surgery of his daughter Angela, victim of a motorcycle accident, the surgeon Timoteo (Sergio Castellitto) recalls his torrid affair with and passion for Italia (Pen√©lope Cruz), a simple woman from slums in the periphery of the big city where he lives. The ghost of the beloved and sexual object of desire Italia chases him in his memories.
This preposterous bit of nonsense has the gall to present us with a hero(?) who starts his courtship of a young woman that he first meets when he RAPES her! Pure garbage! Of course he IS a medical doctor and his manly rape technique is so appealing to this unsophisticated young naive twit that she falls in love with him and his suave Italian approach to courtship immediately. Obviously this is a movie made by a very sophisticated movie maker and one that is much too deep for the likes of me..Clearly the maker of this fine movie is intimately familiar with the rape approach to lasting love,one that perhaps might be employed by we naive Americans.
