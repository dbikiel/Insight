'Devi' focuses on a young woman who is deemed a goddess when her father-in-law, a rich feudal land-lord, has a dream envisioning her as an avatar of Kali.
In 'Goddess' (originally titled 'Devi'), Doyamoyee is left alone with her husband's aging father-in-law, a devoted follower of the goddess Kali. One evening, the aging widower she cares for dreams she is an avatar of Kali, and must be worshipped. Word spreads, and others come to believe that she is an incarnation of the deity. Hearing this alarming news, her husband, Umprasad, returns only to find Doyamoyee herself beginning to believe that she is an avatar; a belief which soon turns to tragedy.
In the countryside of India, Umaprasad has been happily married with his seventeen year-old wife Doyamoyee for three years. They live in the house of Umaprasad's father Kalikinkar Roy, who worships the goddess Kali, with Umaprasad's elder brother Taraprasad, his wife Harasundari and their child Khoka. Umaprasad has a conversation with Doyamoyee and explains that he will move to the big city to study English and she questions why he needs to travel to go to school. Sometime later, Kalikinkar has a dream that Doyamoyee is the reincarnation of Kali and the locals come to Kalikinkar's house to worship her. Doyamoyee asks Harasundari to write to Umaprasad and soon he returns home. But Doyamoyee has been brainwashed with the situation and begins to believe that she might be the reincarnation of Kali leading the family to a tragedy.
