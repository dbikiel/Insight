Charles Chaplin is employed as a janitor in a bank. He falls in love with a stenographer and one day finds a necktie on her desk with a note reading, "To Charlie, With Love." He buys a bouquet and puts it on the stenographer's desk. In the meantime, the cashier, whose name is Charlie, receives the necktie and goes to the stenographer to thank her. She, in turn, thanks him for the flowers, but he denies sending them. She learns that they are from the janitor and throws them into the waste basket. Chaplin is watching her through the door and his heart is shattered. He goes to the basement to sulk and finally falls asleep. He dreams of an attempt to hold up the bank. The cashier hides under a desk while he grapples with the robbers. He hurls them into a vault and holds them until the police arrive, then rescues the stenographer who has been gagged. The cashier is discharged for his cowardice, while the president of the bank showers his praises on Chaplin. The girl throws herself into his arms. Chaplin wakes up to find that he is hugging and kissing a mop. He wanders to the foot of the stairs and sees the stenographer in the cashier's arms.
