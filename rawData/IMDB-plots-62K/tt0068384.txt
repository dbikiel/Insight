A down on his luck former drug dealer is forced by a corrupt LAPD policeman to sell 100 kilos of confiscated marijuana in one weekend.
Cisco is an ex-rock star, famous in the 1960s, whose life and career has been a mess because of drugs. Now with a pregnant girlfriend he has a chance to start a new life. A corrupt cop, Leo Holland, blackmails Cisco to sell marijuana for him. Cisco has one weekend to sell it to his friends.
Cisco Pike is out of jail for dealing drugs, living with girlfriend Sue in Venice, going straight, writing songs and singing. Trouble is, he's got another court date, so he's vulnerable to pressure from a crooked cop, LAPD Sergeant Leo Holland, who gives Cisco less than three days to sell bricks of marijuana and deliver $10,000. Cisco tries, but it's complicated by Sue's disappointment that he's dealing again, the unannounced arrival of Jesse (Cisco's old singing partner) strung out on heroine and a recent divorce, and a drug sale that almost ends in a bust. Can Cisco avoid a new arrest, make the sales, get the money to Leo, and maintain his self respect?
