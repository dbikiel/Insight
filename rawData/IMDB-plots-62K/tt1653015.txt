As Suli struggles to adjust to the new life unexpectedly thrust upon her, a far cry from the dreams and aspirations she once harbored, she meets Tayappa, a man forced to drape a sari and live the life of a woman and a homosexual as he too is a victim of the same circumstances that afflict her life. Brought together by the plight of their similar circumstances and wretched futures, Suli and Tayappa develop a warm and cherishing camaraderie, which eventually blossoms into love. The two gentle, wounded souls seek solace and comfort in each others company. Together they once again dream of living a happy, normal life, but are forced to face the wrath of a highly disapproving community that is hell-bent upon destroying their union.
