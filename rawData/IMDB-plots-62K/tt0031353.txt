A Catholic priest by the name of Father Loma must convince a man to step forward to save an innocent man from being sent to the electric chair.
Pat Sullivan has committed a murder and told his priest, Father Loma, about it watches in agony when an innocent man, Michal O'Keefe, is accused of the crime and sentenced to the electric chair on circumstantial evidence. The priest, bound by inviolable sanctity of the confessional, also struggles with the issue of how to save O'Keefe, and keep his religious vows.
