Urtiga and Santamaria are two mean, sadistic and cold blood killers. Santamaria claims that he has seen an angel, and is very mystic. They escape from the police siege in a slum in a hill and hide in an isolated house. When the owner arrives with two friends, they kill the man and submit the two women to many humiliations, before killing them. While moving to another place, they leave a trail of blood, cowardly executing many persons.
