Jacinto and Domitila are two indigenous Bolivians, happily married... and the most notorious criminals in the country. When they are paid to transport 50kg of cocaine to the Brazilian border, they embark on a journey that will take them through the jungles, mountains, deserts and cities of Bolivia on a riotous adventure that will test their relationship and make them question their future as criminals. Setting out from El Alto, the highest city in the world, they disguise themselves as a farming couple expecting a baby, with the cocaine hidden in Domitilas false pregnant belly. The man behind the smuggling operation, known as El Negro, is actually a blonde, blue-eyed American with a well-kept secret. Hunting down the criminals are two of the best Anti-narcotics officers in the country a corrupt Lieutenant and his racist cadet. What should have been a simple arrest soon becomes a hilarious game of cat-and-mouse with the criminals outwitting their pursuers at every turn, with the help of a bizarre medley of Bolivian characters and a narrator who sharply exposes all the irony and corruption that comes with Bolivian life. Both a celebration and a parody of Bolivian customs, countryside and culture, 'Who Killed The White Llama?' is a boisterous comedy with a more serious message at its heart: When it comes to poverty, nothing is sacred. Despite the continuing criminal, political and economic scandals that plague the country, the racial divides and the drug-trafficking, the media story that really sweeps the nation concerns the accidental killing of a baby white llama.
