Three Catholic priests meet to celebrate the anniversary of an event which could have taken their lives. Their experiences and motivations to serve as priests are extremely different, and soon each of them will have to face new challenges.
A few years ago, tragic events combined the fate of three Catholic priests. Now, on every anniversary of the catastrophe that they miraculously escaped with their lives, the clergymen meet to celebrate the fact of their survival. Their everyday lives are, however, very different. Lisowski (Jacek Braciak) is an entrepreneurial curia worker in a big city who dreams of moving to the Vatican. The problem is that Archbishop Mordowicz (Janusz Gajos) is standing in his way, a luxurious dignitary who uses political influence to build the largest sanctuary in Poland. The second of the priests, Trybus (Robert Wieckiewicz), unlike Lisowski, is a rural pastor. Serving in a place full of poverty, he increasingly succumbs to human weaknesses. Kukula (Arkadiusz Jakubik) is also not very successful, and - despite his fervent faith - actually loses the trust of his parishioners day by day. Soon the stories of the three clergymen merge once again, and the events that will take place will have an impact on all of their lives.
