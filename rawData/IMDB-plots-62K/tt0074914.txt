After a wild night on the town, a dashing British airline pilot is attacked by thugs, and when he wakes in hospital he finds himself being cared for by a beautiful doctor, Emy Wong. He falls in love with her, but Emy gravely informs him that, in the ancient East Asian custom, she is betrothed to a man she has never met.
