Worried that he costs too much to feed, Clifford runs away to join a carnival act and help win a lifetime supply of Tummy Yummies.
Clifford overhears Mr. Bleakman say that feeding him must cost a lot of money. A carnival act called "Larry's Amazing Animals" has just been in town, and the animals in the show told Clifford about an animal contest with a prize of a lifetime supply of Tummy Yummies. So he decides to run away along with Cleo and T-Bone, join the carnival act, win the contest, and bring the food back. Soon Clifford is the star of the show, and Shackleford the ferret, who'd always been the star, gets jealous. Clifford just wants to help and win the contest -- but getting back home to Emily Elizabeth may not be as easy as he thinks, even after the contest is over.
Clifford (voiced by John Ritter), the big red dog of children's books and the TV series, hits the big screen for his great adventure. Clifford lives on Birdwell Island with Emily Elizabeth. Clifford hears the next-door neighbor talking to Emily's father about how much it cost to feed Clifford. Clifford is worried that the family might lose their house just feeding him. Clifford sees a poster announcing a contest for the best animal act with the winner getting a lifetime supply of dog food. Clifford, and his two dog friends, Cleo, and T-Bone, leave the island and join a traveling carnival show. They become friends with other animals in one of the sideshows, and soon, they become stars. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy)
