Rider Kelly Cobb travels to county rodeos to win money so he can buy a patch of land he wants to call his own. He rescues trick rider Jackie Adams from the clutches of an amorous sports writer after her saloon song, and they travel together. Jackie begins falling in love with Kelly, but he doesn't seem to notice as he continues to risk life and limb for his dream, occasionally being tempted by floozies. Jackie hopes to convince a man that was born reckless to change his roaming ways.
