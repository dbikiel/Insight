2 cops pull a car over and shoot the driver. Not finding a gun, they plant one on him. The victim's dad, a judge, wants "justice" and after the 2 cops walk, he takes action.
When the son of a successful judge (Taye Diggs) is killed by two police officers (Luke Hemsworth/Gianni Capaldi) and the system sets them free, a hardened veteran detective (John Cusack) finds some incriminating files on the officers and the judge teams up with another mourning father (George Lopez) to take the law into his own hands.
