Ojibway tribe member Hiawatha is sent by his chief to investigate the warlike intentions of the neighboring Dakotah and Illinois tribes that routinely trespass into Ojibway territory.
Hiawatha, a member of the Ojibway tribe, is on a peace mission to the Dakotah tribe. He meets and falls in love with Minniehaha. The romance is obstructed by a threatened war between the two tribes, instigated by a hot-headed Ojibway tribe member. The war is averted and Hiawatha learns that he is actually the long-missing son of the Dakotah chief. Hiawatha and Minniehaha set up tent-keeping together.
