Two brothers, Lemi and Kiza, having spent all their money, try to relocate their dead grandfather from Belgrade to Vrsac at the lowest cost, but he goes missing along the way.
Lemi and Kiza are two brothers who have to bring their dead grandfather from Belgrade to Vrsac, and having spent all their money, they decide to smuggle the body by train. They dress the grandfather and put the body on the train and tell everyone that he is sleeping. After Lemi and Kiza go to drink in the dining car, a drug dealer Limeni fearing police, inserts a drug package in the grandfather's pocket. The train suddenly brakes and a case falls directly on grandfather's head. Other passengers, thinking that it killed him, frenetically throw his body out of the window, under the pretext that the grandfather got up and walked out. Then a search for the grandfather's body starts, but it will not be easy.
