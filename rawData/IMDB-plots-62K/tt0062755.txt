A series of brutal murders in Boston sparks a seemingly endless and increasingly complex manhunt.
Boston is being terrorized by a series of seemingly random murders of women. Based on the true story, the film follows the investigators path through several leads before introducing the Strangler as a character. It is seen almost exclusively from the point of view of the investigators who have very few clues to build a case upon.
In 1962, elderly women are being strangled to death in their homes in the metropolitan Boston area. Panic starts to ensue not only in the general population, but also within the police forces in the Boston area, they who start to apprehend and question every known sexual criminal. Things for the police departments start to get out of control when the victimology is extended to younger women with subsequent stranglings. To show the public that the commonwealth is taking the matter seriously, the state attorney general appoints law professor John S. Bottomly to lead a multi-jurisdictional task force to apprehend the perpetrator. Bottomly feels ill equipped to do so. But he and his team come across two leads: one being a victim, Dianne Cluny, who survives her strangling, and two being a man named Albert DeSalvo being detained for a seemingly unrelated crime. Bottomly notices that DeSalvo, who is institutionalized as he is diagnosed with a possible case of dissociative identity disorder, has an injury matching one that Cluny inflicted on the strangler. Beyond his mental disorder, DeSalvo seems like a decent man. Regardless, Bottomly wants to find out conclusively if DeSalvo is indeed the strangler, even if he will never be tried for the crimes, and even if it causes DeSalvo possible permanent injury to his psyche.
