They are bonded, nonetheless, by friendship and affection for a hen, whose eggs just might make a difference to Prakash's impoverished family. When the boy's father sells the bird, the chums desperately attempt to raise funds in order to buy it back.
We are in the year 2001, a temporary ceasefire brings a much-needed break to a small war-torn village in Northern Nepal, bringing much joy among the residents. Prakash and Kiran, two young close friends, are also starting to feel the change in the air. Though they are divided by caste and social creed, they remain inseparable, and start raising a hen given to Prakash by his sister, with hopes to save money by selling her eggs. However, the hen goes missing. To find it, they embark on a journey, innocently unaware of the tyranny brought by the fragile ceasefire.
