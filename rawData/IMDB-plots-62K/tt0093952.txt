Asta Cadell, a lawyer traveling through the Australian Outback on holiday, stops in a small Western Australian town after her motorcycle breaks down and shacks up with Tim Curtis, the local mechanic, while fixing it. She then becomes involved in helping Curtis' teenage daughter, Lizzie, who has been recently date-raped by Danny Fiske, the son of a wealthy, well-known citizen and his gang. Asta persuades Lizzie to press charges against Danny, but the local population becomes determined to keep the incident a secret at any cost and soon Asta and the Curtis family's lives are in danger.
