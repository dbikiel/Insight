In 2000, David Wain and Michael Showalter set out to make their first film Wet Hot American Summer. It was a low budget independent film and they cast their friends and a handful of unknown actors - many who were just starting out in the business. When it was originally released in 2001 it was panned by critics. Since then the film has become a cult classic and those friends have gone on to become some of the biggest names in comedy. During the original shoot, director Amy Rice had unprecedented access and shot over 25 hours of behind the scenes footage. None of this footage has been seen until now.
