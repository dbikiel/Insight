Five office friends meet up for a night on the town to celebrate the forthcoming marriage of one of them. As the night wears on and the drink starts to tell, they become more confidential in expressing their concerns and hopes.
Five bookkeeper colleagues go out for a night on the town as a bachelor party for Arnold. There is one remaining bachelor among the bunch, Eddie, who is Arnold's best man. The other three married men envy Eddie's carefree life, especially Charlie, who hates his life but can't figure out why. He works hard, goes to night school four days a week, and doesn't spend much time with his pregnant wife, Helen. Charlie doesn't want to admit to himself that he doesn't yet want to be a father. As the purpose of the night hits him, Arnold confides his insecurities to Charlie about love and marriage. A further revelation from Walter, the eldest of the group, makes the men think further about life in general. An encounter with a girl he picks up at a Greenwich Village party and what looks to be desperation on Eddie's part to have a good time makes Charlie realize by the end of the night what he really thinks of his life.
