Various residents and career-criminals face challenges in crime-laden Mumbai.
An NRI faces threats from extortionists when he opens a small business and goes out with an aspiring model. He refuses to pay, both are stalked, and when he complains to the police, they not only shrug it off but offer 'protection' for a price. With increasing pressure, he must now make a decision to re-locate or submit to their demands. Tilak and his friends are career criminals, and sell merchandise that they steal from passengers using public transportation. He also buys best-selling novels, has copies printed, and has them sold at busy traffic signals. Things change when his group find guns and an explosive device in a stolen bag. Sawan Murthy wants to be a cricketer and must come up with Rs.10 Lakhs in order to be inducted in the 20/20 team. He has no money, nobody will lend him any, and he considers robbing the Citizen's Co-operative Bank. Just some of the challenges faced by regular Mumbaites and criminals in this crime-laden city.
