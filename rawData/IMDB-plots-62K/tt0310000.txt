She drives a cab on the night shift and meets every scum there is. Gyung-sun lives a scant life day by day, but she used to be a professional safecracker that earned her the nickname, "Leather Jacket". Once she was a hot item, now she's all washed up. On the job, she relieves her fatigue with tonic beverages, and finishes a cigarette with just one drag, but she gets by the day clinging on to the chance that someday she'll meet her only hope in life, her daughter. But the world doesn't seem to let her have things that easy. She's still haunted by her dark past as this third-rate gangster keeps threatening her to pay back the money her ex-husband ran away with. Then one day she meets a girl named Soo-jin, who is a spitting image of herself back when she had it made. With Soo-jin's help she gets fed up with her dire circumstances, and finally decides to do something about it. To live for tomorrow, she fights the world for a day.
