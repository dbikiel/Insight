The gang throws Mickey a surprise birthday party; his present is an electric organ, which Minnie plays while Mickey does a jazzy dance. Goofy bakes the cake, but keeps having trouble with it falling. The gang does a conga line to a Latin tune.
The original gang's all here, nearly, when Minnie Mouse throws a birthday party for Mickey, with Donald Duck, Clara Cluck, Clarabel Cow, Horace Horsecollar and Goofy among the attendees. All hands participate in a jam session while Goofy is in the kitchen making a birthday cake. The first one falls flat, the second one is so heavy it falls through the floor and the third erupts like a volcano. Meanwhile, the party is hitting on all six and the beat is eight-bars and Donald is doing the Conga with Clara Cluck, who is just happy to have gotten out of the hen-house for the first time in many years.
