The sacrifices of the four sons of Guru Gobind Singh ji (tenth guru of Sikhs) - Baba Ajit Singh ji, Baba Jujhar Singh ji, Baba Zorawar Singh ji and Baba Fateh Singh ji.
The movie is based on a true historical event about Dashmesh Pita Guru Gobind Singh Ji and his four Sahibzaade (Son). Guru Gobind Singh Ji Sahib fought for the Hindu community against the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. The Mughal Empror Aurangzeb tortured Hindus in India to accept Islam. His Commander Wazir Khan failed to do anything against Guru Maharaj and finally Wazir Khan conspired against Guru Gobind Singh Ji with help of other Hindu Kings. He succeeded in his conspiracy up to certain extent and family of Guru Gobind Singh Ji separated. The two elder Sahibzaade (Sahibzaada Ajit Singh Ji and Sahibzaada Jhujhar Singh Ji)left with Guru Maharaj and the two younger Sahibzaade (Sahibzaada Zorawar Singh Ji and Sahibzaada Fateh Singh Ji) with their Grand Mother Mata Gujri Ji. Sahibzaada Ajit Singh Ji and Sahibzaada Zorawar Singh Ji sacrifice their life in the battle of Chamkaur, where 42 Sikh fighters fought against 1 million soldiers of Wazir Khan. Sahibzaada Zorawar Singh Ji and Sahibzaada Fateh Singh Ji captured by the soldiers of Wazir Khan along with their grand mother due to betrayal by their own greedy servant Kaalu. Wazir Khan forced them to accept Islam, assuming them just ordinary small kids but they followed the way of martyrdom and sacrifice and showed the courage like their father and grand father. This is story of courage and sacrifice.
