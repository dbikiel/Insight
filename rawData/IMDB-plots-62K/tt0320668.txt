Paul Miller has struggled as an actor in Hollywood for years, and now he's had enough. In two days, he's going to kill himself. But in true Hollywood style, he's hired a film crew to chronicle his last moments.
Paul Miller, a self-described "failed actor," sets out for his final act and his ultimate role: the last two days of his life ending with his suicide on tape. He tries to reunite with old friends and family members to say one last final goodbye, all of whom attempt to coax him out of killing himself or dismiss his intentions as a joke.
