Single father Bob Holcomb, dissatisfied with his daughter JoJo's choice of partner, seizes an unexpected opportunity to bring her on a trip to Sweden in order for her to forget all thoughts on marriage. Confronted with liberal Swedish morals, he finds out that marriage might not be too bad an idea after all.
American oil executive Bob Holcomb has a big problem: his beautiful teenage daughter, JoJo. She's fallen madly in love with a guitar-playing teenage boy, Kenny Klinger who lives at the beach and in Bob's mind at least, doesn't exactly meet his idea for an ideal son-in-law. JoJo is determined to have her way so when Bob's company needs a senior executive to manage their operations in Stockholm, he's first in line, convinced that a separation is all JoJo needs to come to her senses. Bob is immediately attracted to Karin Grastetdt, the interior decorator his company's hired to decorate his new house. JoJo has all the attention she can handle from Erik Carlson, who also works for the oil company. He's constantly asking her out and Bob thinks she's in safe hands until they tell him they're going off together for a two week holiday. His only solution is to get Kenny to Sweden as soon as possible to break up JoJo's new romance.
