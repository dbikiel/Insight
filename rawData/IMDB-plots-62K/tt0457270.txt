A high school kid (Sumpter) develops an addiction to Internet porn so intense that it begins to destroy his life and tear his family apart.
When popular high school sophomore swimming champion Justin Peterson becomes addicted to on-line pornography, the erotic images infest his mind and poison his life, destroying his relationship with his parents, his friends, and his girlfriend.
Justin Peterson is an All State swimming champion with a religious girlfriend, slightly overzealous parents, and a younger brother who whines and eats a lot. Everything good in his life comes to a screeching halt when he receives a link to a website owned by high school senior Monica, who does things for her boyfriend via web-cam. Soon Justin develops an intense addiction to Internet porn that causes his mother to go into hysterics (and his father shortly thereafter) and alienates his girlfriend. In the meantime, he develops an affinity for energy drinks and lying about homework assignments.
