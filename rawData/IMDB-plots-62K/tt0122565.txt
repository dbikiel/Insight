Pivoting around a shiny counterfeit gold sovereign freshly milled from the clandestine workshop of an otherwise honest goldsmith, four brief vignettes of human imperfection; seduction; fate; desire, and devotion inextricably interweave.
Four stories, humorous, romantic or dramatic, are linked by a counterfeit gold sovereign. It is made by the honest engraver in the first story, seduced by the charms of a young widow, and it subsequently passes into the hands of a beggar and a prostitute, a wealthy miser and a newly married couple where the husband is a poor artist.
Pivoting around a shiny counterfeit gold sovereign freshly milled from the clandestine workshop of the otherwise honest goldsmith, Anargiros, four brief vignettes inextricably interweave against the backdrop of human imperfections, and man's unappeasable desire of enrichment. From this perspective, dangerous and inhumanly selfish seduction gives birth to a single fake coin--the embodiment of a lifetime's worth of accomplishments--that will, ignominiously, find its way into a ragged panhandler's hole-ridden pocket. From there, ironically, the seemingly Godsend gift will become an impoverished orphan's intolerable burden--and then, by a twist of fate--a love-smitten couple of young and penniless bohemians decide to use the precious finding as the foundation of their ardent and interminable devotion. However, can true love be based on spurious hope?
