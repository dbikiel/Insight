A scientist tries to prove the existence of the Loch Ness monster.
Dr. Dempsey, an American scientist who has become a skeptic after a disastrous wrong call, isn't exactly enthusiastic to be sent by his well-funded employer to Scotland to (dis)prove the existence of the Loch Ness monster, but has no choice. He finds the locals stubborn, "primitive" and all but hospitable, not in the least because the Nessie legend is the only tourist attraction, but still gets romantically attracted by his independent inn-keeper Laura, and both her kid and his enthusiastic local assistant end up making him face a small family of Nessie-dinosaurs, but is this to be made public?
