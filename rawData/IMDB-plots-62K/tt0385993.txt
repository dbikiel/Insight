Veteran actor Pablo Thevenet has no luck: His daughter has been murdered, his wife has left him, he finds no job and his agent wants to leave him - current directors will never give him a role. He hates current talentless stars on TV talk shows. Suddenly, he finds some job - as a living sculpture in a whore house working for a Mr. Reficul and his transsexual assistant Dora Grizzel. Pablo becomes an artistic murderer, searching for those he thinks responsible of his current state. He also meets job partner Tic-Tac, an ex-prostitute who will sympathize with Pablo. Pablo also attracts the attention of unusual producer Ambrose Fuch, who wants him to act and direct movies. Everybody seems to have something to hide - including serial killer Pablo.
