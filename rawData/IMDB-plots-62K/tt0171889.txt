Ted Smith becomes trapped in the TV shows he watches, which include a horror movie, commercials, game shows, and spoofs of singular purpose cable channels (e.g. The Time Channel).
Ted Smith is a young man with multiple personalities who goes to his psychiatrist as a completely new person for each visit. He mentions that he sometimes views his life as a scene in a TV show, which leads to a series of movie and TV spoofs between each of the psychiatry segments. In addition to the obligatory horror movie parody, there are also riffs on game shows, cable news channels and commercials.
