Renegade Luke has been living an easy life so far, travelling through the southwest with his horse Joe, making money by running small-time scams. All this comes to an end when he encounters Moose, an imprisoned convict with a young son. Moose makes Luke an offer: move into his property and become the legal guardian of his son, and in return he won't get his friends to make legal trouble for Luke. Things don't go smoothly for the drifter and the boy at first, but gradually they come to settle into their new situation.
