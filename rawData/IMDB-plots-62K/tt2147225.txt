A volatile, oil-rich Nigerian community wages war against their corrupt government and a multi-national oil corporation to protect their land from being destroyed by excessive drilling and spills. To seek justice, a rebel organization kidnaps an American oil executive and demands that his corporation end the destruction and pollution. Inspired by true events, Black November is the gripping story of how a community rises up and takes drastic measures to make sure their voices are heard.
Hudson (played by Mickey Rourke), is the CEO of an oil company responsible for plundering the Niger Deltans land and destroying the environment. Nigerian militants reach their threshold when they find out a pregnant Ebiere (played by Mbong Amata), one of the victims of civil atrocities, will be hanged for a crime she did not commit. The enraged militants led by Tamuno (played by Enyinna Nwigwe), head to American soil and hold an unsuspecting group hostage that includes Hudson and Kristy (played by Kim Basinger).
