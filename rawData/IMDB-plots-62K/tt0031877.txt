A singer becomes a star in the Ziegfeld Follies, but her marriage to a con man has a bad effect on her career.
New York city in the 1920s: a singer struggles to keep her boyfriend from trouble. When she makes it to Ziegfeld, he heads for five years in jail. Lots of Faye and Jolson singing. The story is so close to the true story of Fanny Brice and Nicky Arnstein (Jules W. Arndt Stein) that he sued the studio in a case that was quickly settled out of court in his favor.
Rose Sargent, a star in the Ziegfeld Follies, falls for and marries crook and con man Bart Clinton. She stands by him in the face of his disgrace and the resultant deleterious effects on her career.
