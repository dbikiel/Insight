The life of Gaby Brimmer, a girl physically handicapped, who finally gets her goals of study and triumph.
The life story of Gabriela Brimmer, a victim of cerebral palsy. Born in Mexico just after the Second World War, Gaby, as she's called, is for the first several years of her life thought to be either a vegetable or, to quote her doctor, a child of normal intelligence "locked inside a body that cannot respond." Her maid notices that she is resisting food and realizes that she can control her foot. From there Gaby learns to write, study and becomes an artist, writer and activist.
