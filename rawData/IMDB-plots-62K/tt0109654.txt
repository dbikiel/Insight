A chance encounter with a blonde in a sports car causes a man to give chase in his souped up mustang and culminates in a car crash and a sexual encounter. The blonde asks that he sign that the accident was really her husband's fault, who was not even present, for insurance issues. The sex-befuddled dummy agrees and finds himself the alibi for a murder and with his own past criminal record, he fears jail for lying under oath.
