The most famous guitar-makers in the world band together on a journey into one of the most primeval forests on earth. Their struggle is with a Native American logging company, their hope: to save the acoustic guitar.
Musicwood is a modern twist on a classic story; an urgent battle between the white man and Native Americans, where age-old land disputes upend our simplistic view of the past. The Musicwood documentary follows Bob Taylor (Taylor Guitars), Chris Martin (Martin Guitars), and Dave Berryman of Gibson Guitars - as they unite as a group, drop their competitive differences and travel together into the heart of the largest coastal temperate rain forest in the world. They have to negotiate with Native American loggers to save the centuries old Sitka Spruce trees, before it's too late. The film documents the guitar-makers' struggle to build a relationship with the Native Americans that acknowledges the injustices of their past but fights to preserve the forest for our future. Featuring The Antlers, Steve Earle, Kaki King, Lambchop, Turin Brakes, and Yo La Tengo.
