In a historically altered Korea, by 2005 the North and South Korean governments have secretly joined forces to create a nuclear warhead.
The movie follows two sides: one army whose orders are to deliver a nuke and the other army determined to stop them and try to get the nuke away from them. As luck has it, a comet nears the earth and causes a time rift sending the two groups of soldiers back to 1572. The two sides are now in confusion as to where their nuke has gone to and how to return home.
