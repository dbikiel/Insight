In 1912, a Norwegian woman dies in childbirth, leaving behind a daughter born with hypertrichosis, or excessive hair growth, and a grieving husband who hides the girl from gawkers.
Adapted from the novel "LÃ¸vekvinnen" (The Lion Woman) by Erik Fosnes Hansen (2006), the story follows Eva, who is born with hypertrichosis, a congenital condition that causes excessive hair growth over her entire body. Her father grieves not only for the loss of his wife during childbirth, but also for his daughter's abnormal appearance. As Eva's life unfolds, she is in contact with those who shun, embrace, and abuse her, yet she survives with intelligence, wit, and inner beauty.
