After a few years of financial hardship, a young mother (RACHEL) decides to go back to work to help her ex-husband with the mounting bills. With no one to watch their 4-year-old daughter (MIA), the mother decides to enroll her into the local daycare center called Little Ones owned by a seemingly responsible older woman, (DEBORAH). After a few weeks of Mia's awkward behavior, Rachel concludes her daughter may be getting mistreated by (GABBY) one of the centers daycare teachers.
After a car crash lands Troy in a wheelchair, his embittered wife Gabby, who lost her baby in the accident, and apparent hit and run, becomes the breadwinner, working in Little Ones, a model daycare center owned by generous Deborah. She takes an unusual interest in Mia, the 4 year-old daughter of Rachel, a court sketch artist who wrongly assumed she could get rich alimony from her ex, poorly paid city lawyer Daniel, who is duly skeptical when Rachel suspects Mia may be abused, but strange things keep happening, also around their homes.
