A woman is taken along with her mother in 1910 to a far-away desert by her husband, and after his passing, is forced to spend the next 59 years of her life hopelessly trying to escape it.
Áurea arrives at a town in the dunes of State of Maranhão, Brazil, in 1910, having for female company only her mother Maria. She is pregnant and wants a way out of that arid place. But leaving is difficult and, somehow, she still hopes to find happiness there. The film follows these two lives for three generations, including Áurea's daughter.
In 1910, in Maranhão, the insane Vasco de Sá moves with his pregnant urban wife Áurea and her mother Maria to a wilderness land near a lagoon and surrounded by shifting dunes. Sooner his workers abandon the place, and Vasco dies, leaving the two women alone and without any resources. They are supported by a local son of a former slave, Massu, and they learn how to survive creating goats. Along the years, Áurea raises her daughter Maria, hoping to move back to the capital someday. Her hope becomes anguish and despair as years go by, until her final adaptation to the place.
