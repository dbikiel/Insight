Kate, a workaholic lawyer, has three weeks to get a haunted bed and breakfast appraised and sold. The uncooperative manager claims a spirit who lives there will not approve. With Kate's possible promotion resting on accomplishing this task, she checks in and haggles with the aforesaid Christmas spirit, who suspiciously seems awfully solid for a ghost.
Emotionally frigid attorney Kate Jordan reluctantly accepts an end-of-the-year assignment to get a reputedly haunted inn appraised and sold by year's end. By and by she meets Daniel, the resident ghost who, for the past ninety-five years, inexplicably returns to life each December during the twelve days of Christmas. Kate has only one logical recourse for their mutual benefit: break the curse that binds him - but falling for a man almost a century her senior isn't among her plans.
The senior partner of a US law firm, eager to finish an estate sale in rustic Canada before Christmas, entrusts it to workaholic junior Kate, suggesting it may swing her promotion to partner. When she arrives, the required expert hired to inspect it leaves inconclusively, the latest scare-victim of the locally repute house ghost. The caretaker fails to scare her off though, she even insists to stay there alone, and isn't daunted when she meet ghost Daniel. He's a gentleman who was trapped by a curse since his murder there during the Prohibition, nicknamed Christmas spirit because he only materializes on the twelve days of Christmas, and refuses to 'waste' that time on more fruitless efforts to study and break his curse, yet gets dragged in by Kate, while both get mutual crushes, tested by conflicting loyalties to her job and his former fiancee, also a ghost.
