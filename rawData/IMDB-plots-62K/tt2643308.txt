This movie is about soccer hooligans, the most aggressive and violent soccer aficionados. They are an exclusive group, the elite of all soccer fans. Whoever they may be in their everyday lives-college students, bankers, musicians, or car mechanics-they are a "firm". It's easy to get into a firm, but once you're in, it's for life. There's no going back. The movie is based on actual events.
