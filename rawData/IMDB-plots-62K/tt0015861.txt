Tore takes over the rundown family farm. Applying his youthful energy, he intends to make it into a big farm like Glomg√•rden on the other side of the river, where beautiful Berit lives. Tore falls in love with her, but her father has promised her to rich Gjermund. As her wedding to Gjermund draws near, Berit runs away and seeks refuge with Tore and his parents. She soon falls deathly ill but recovers, asking for, and getting, her father's permission to marry Tore. Jealous Gjermund is determined to prevent their wedding, however, in a dramatic climactic scene playing out around the rushing river.
