The story of Bambi growing up in the care of his father, The Great Prince of the Forest.
Picking up shortly after the original movie's end, Bambi follows his father, the Great Prince, into the forest after his mother's death and the Great Prince must teach the young fawn, and his friends Thumper, Flower and Owl, how a deer survives in the forest. But the Great Prince finds that his high-spirited son may have a lesson or two to teach him, as well.
