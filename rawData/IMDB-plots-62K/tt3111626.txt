As Belgrade silently gets ready for yet another night of NATO bombings, Ana, Bojan and Sloba try to retain their sanity while dealing with their fears.
Belgrade, 1999. People go in and out of caf√©s, and lively conversation echoes all around. As if no one expects the NATO bombings. As if they never even started. But there is tension nonetheless, behind the eyes of people who suppress their fear at any cost. It is in this time and place that Ana, Sloba and Bojan construct their own sense of normality in order to retain their sanity. Three ways to deal with fear. One random sky above.
Every day Ana, Sloba and Bojan put their lives at great risk, simply by going to work. Their jobs are in or next to the national television building in Belgrade, which because of the war has become a strategic target for NATO bombings. All three force themselves to deal with the fear, in order to hold on to their ordinary lives. But "ordinary" has ceased to exist some time ago. The actress Ana (35) wants to stay loyal to the theatre she loves dearly, but which is located next to the TV building. Although secretly terrified, she keeps compelling herself to go. To escape from reality, the hip youngster Bojan (23) immerses himself in the club scene with its sex, drugs and house music. Broadcast technician Sloba (46) has sent his wife and son to safety out of town, but has stayed behind to earn their livelihood. That's his mission and nothing can deter him from it. Every night Belgrade transforms from a vibrant city into a military target. While the bombs fall from the sky above, Ana, Bojan and Sloba struggle with the question: How can I survive, while staying sane in an insane world?
