A Japanese family weathers much hardship after their military uncle comes to live with them during WWII.
Kinoshita's first film after the end of World War II is a wrenching, superbly wrought tale about a liberal-minded Japanese family torn apart by war and imperialist politics. Morning for the Osone Family is both palpably bitter about the nation's fresh wartime wounds and inspiringly hopeful about a democratic tomorrow.
