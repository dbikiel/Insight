When the first snow falls in the valley, it is urgent to prepare its reserves for the winter. Alas, during the operation, a small ladybug is trapped in a box - to the Caribbean. One solution: reform the shock team.
Light patches of snow start to lie all around the peaceful forest after the exciting events in Minuscule - La vall√©e des fourmis perdues (2013), and papa Ladybug prepares for the winter, only to see his son get trapped in a large cardboard box of canned chestnut cream destined for the sun-kissed Guadeloupe. Once more--in this thrilling new adventure a long way from home--the determined father, his old companions, and some new Caribbean friends set out on a dangerous rescue mission in the heart of the lush jungle, as mesmerising praying mantises and hungry hairy tarantulas lurk in every nook and cranny. Will the dauntless search party make it in time?
