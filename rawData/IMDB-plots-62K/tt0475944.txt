To the students of the Spenser Academy, the Sons of Ipswich are the baddest boys on campus. But that's not all they share. The four friends also share a 300-year-old secret: they're warlocks, the teenage descendants of a 17th-century coven of witches. So when the long-banished fifth son suddenly appears and threatens to kill their loved ones, they realize they must face their enemy in order to prevent him from stealing their powers and shattering the covenant forever.
when a new kid by the name of chase collins, tranfers into the elite Spencer Accademy, 4 boys get suspious. the four boys are what people call the sons of ipswitch. they were 4 of the origional 5 families to coloinize ipswitch. the 5th, is said to have been killed during the salem witch hunts. when the 4 boys, caleb, pogue, reid and, tyler, befriend chase, weird things start to happen. it turns out that chase is a desentant of the 5th blood line, and "one of them". we find out that the reason that chase is here, it to get the other members of the covenant's powers. by having them "will it" to him. on caleb's birthday, caleb and chase get into a fight to the death. caleb ends up killing chase (or so we think). chase gets thrown into a fire and his body is never found, so the boys assume that he is dead, saving himself, the covenant, and all of their loved ones.
