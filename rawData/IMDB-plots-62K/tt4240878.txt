The Milky Way is a groundbreaking breastfeeding documentary that will change the face of American motherhood. What 'Food, Inc.' did for the food industry in America, this film will do for breastfeeding in our country. It will make every viewer rethink motherhood and how we treat mothers. It is a film that will empower each woman to trust her body, her baby, and herself in her journey as a mother. It will make her laugh, cry, nod fiercely in agreement, get angry, and then get so inspired it will be impossible not to take action. This film will start a galactic revolution. Hold on and stand by.
