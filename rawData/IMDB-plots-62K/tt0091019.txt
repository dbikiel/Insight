A Protestant World War II pilot and a Jewish girl fall in love in Jerusalem, even though their diverse backgrounds threaten to pull them apart.
An American flyer who joined the RAF before his country was in the war is recovering from a leg injury in Jerusalem. Through an English friend he meets a quiet Jewish girl whose close-knit family originally came from Spain. The two are attracted to each other but she is convinced their diverse backgrounds mean it could never work; not only is he a gentile, his father is a protestant minister. So though they keep running into each other in the small community, they find themselves just as frequently parting again.
As David, an American who is enlisted in the British Royal Air Force, recuperates for a war injury, he winds up getting to know a reserved sephardic Spaniard named Sarah and they eventually fall in love. The dilemma is that Sarah's family is extremely controlling and requires that all family members marry only Jews. David and Sarah's love becomes so full of passion that Sarah will escape from her home going down a sheet rope from her bedroom balcony to be with David before he goes back to serving in the war. She makes David promise never to see her again once he leaves for duty and so they have their last exchange of love and passion as a goodbye. Now, the question is will they ever meet again? Its like a Romeo and Juliet kind of story. Will her family really keep her from reuniting with David after the war, if he winds up coming back in spite of the promise to never reunite? Love is the fire that makes life full of great spirit. Long live "El Amor". This story touches on the life of the sephardic jew culture and the use of the old Spanish language from Spain called "Ladino".
