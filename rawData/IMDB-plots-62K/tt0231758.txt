A French aristocrat, who has recently arrived in America, has placed a personal advertisement in the newspaper. In the ad, he invites any well-to-do young woman who is interested in marriage to meet him near Grant's Tomb. When he goes to the meeting place, he is quickly met by an increasingly large number of women. He soon becomes flustered and runs off. When he does so, the women decide to pursue him.
