A uniformed cop is recruited by a drug enforcement agent to infiltrate a drug smuggling ring looking to expand its operation.
A black uniformed policeman is recruited by a devious drug enforcement agent to infiltrate a smuggling organization seeking to expand into designer drugs. This 'ugly side of the war on drugs' explores the context of race, identity and hypocrisy within a brutal and alienating investigation.
The black policeman Russell Steven applies for a special anti-drug squad which targets the highest boss of cocain delivery to LA: the Columbian foreign minister's nephew. Russell shall work his way up from the bottom undercover, until he reaches the boss. First step is to get the lawyer and hobby dealer David Jason to trust him. Jason wants to switch to legal designer drugs, but hasn't got the capital yet, so Steven's ambitious help is welcomed. To keep his cover, Steven has to go further than any officer before: he has to really sell the drugs he buys, and some day even eliminate a competitor... and gets problems seeing the line between the good and the bad.
