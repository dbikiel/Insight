Two babies are switched at birth. When the mistake is discovered 12 years later, it leads to complications in the lives of both families. One family is affluent, with dutiful and (apparently) contented children. The other family is poor, with rambunctious (even delinquent) children, often hungry, but with lots of laughter in the house.
A vengeful nurse (Catherine Hiegel) gets back at the doctor (Daniel Gélin) she's been having an affair with by switching two babies in the maternity ward. The families taking home new babies couldn't be more different. The affluent Le Quesnoy family takes home a daughter, and the criminal-minded Groseilles take home a little boy. Neither family causes much of a fuss when they discover what's happened, so the switched girl (Valérie Lalande) and boy (Benoît Magimel) remain with the wrong families.
