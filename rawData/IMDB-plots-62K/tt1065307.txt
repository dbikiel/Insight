Alice is a burnt out. She tries to keep her kids in order, her husband happy, and runs a cause of trying to save a tree she loves. One day when looking in her three way mirror, she wishes there was more of her. All of the sudden, the three reflections of Alice pop out of the mirror. One version is motherly and takes care of her kids, the second one works on the cause that Alice is fighting, and the final version of Alice is oversexed and just wants to please Alice's husband, Rex. The trade off is that the real Alice becomes invisible. At first, Alice enjoys her peace and quiet, but when her alter egos start running amok and start doing things she doesn't like, Alice vows to take her life back.
A busy woman splits into three versions of herself to fullfill her role of career professional, doting mom, and loving wife.
