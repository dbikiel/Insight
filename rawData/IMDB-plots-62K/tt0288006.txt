Bits of found film and different types of animation illustrate a classic chase scene scenario: A woman is abducted and a man comes to her rescue, but during their escape they find themselves in the enemy's secret headquarters.
In a desperate attempt to save the girl, the legendary actor, Humphrey Bogart, rides a proud wild mustang, as the Austrian filmmaker Virgil Widrich's rapid-fire montage seamlessly incorporates 65,000 print-outs of iconic film frames into one long and frenzied chase sequence. A multitude of adversaries--including the emblematic monster from Frankenstein (1931)--want to thwart the ambitious plans of the dauntless man of action, Sean Connery, and his intrepid companion, Harrison Ford, who are pitching in to help; however, not if the elegant, Audrey Hepburn, and the beautiful, Eva Marie Saint, can help it. Who knew one could cram so many classic cinema mega-stars in less than thirteen minutes?
