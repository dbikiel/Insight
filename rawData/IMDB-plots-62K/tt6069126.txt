An ordinary woman makes an extraordinary decision which will change her life forever.
A woman sets out to reclaim her life in this stirring, emotionally rich look at what it means to start over. Tara (Arterton), a housewife and mother in suburban London, is living a life that is no longer hers: it belongs to her loving but overworked and self-absorbed husband (Cooper), her young son and daughter and the numbing routine of housework and childcare. In desperate need of a change, Tara one day makes a bold decision. Armed with a one-way ticket to Paris, she leaves everything behind to rediscover herself in a new city - but walking out on your life isn't so simple.
