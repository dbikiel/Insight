A lonely, obnoxious young millionaire pays a family to spend Christmas with him.
Wealthy Chicago ad executive Drew Latham has long avoided the family traditions of Christmas, but has dreaded being alone on the actual day. So when his tropical Christmas vacation with girlfriend Missy Vangilder falls through and Missy breaks up with him in the process, a self-therapy session leads Drew to decide to relive his best childhood Christmases. With his loved ones long-gone, he decides to rent a family: the Valcos, the current owners of his childhood home in suburban Chicago. Tom Valco wants nothing to do with Drew until an exorbitant amount of money is involved; they draw up a contract which expires at the end of Christmas night. What Drew doesn't (or refuses to) realize is that the Valcos are having their own problems, which his presence exacerbates. Can the Valcos endure their unexpected guest? If they can, will the money solve their problems? Meanwhile, will Drew come to realize what he wants in life and how to achieve it?
Drew Latham is an executive living an empty, shallow life with only wealth on his side. Facing another lonely Christmas, he wants to revisit his old childhood home and possibly relive some holiday memories. But when he arrives at the house in which he was raised, the Valcos are living there--Tom, Christine, and their teenage son Brian. Drew offers a nice financial reward, which makes them much more willing to accept this unexpected, inconvenient, Christmas-loving visitor.
