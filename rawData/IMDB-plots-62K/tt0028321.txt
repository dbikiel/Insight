Meek Eddie Pink becomes manager of an amusement park beset by mobsters.
After helping a numbskull graduate college, a nebbish blunders into a job running an amusement park. There he wards off a variety of con artists and other miscreants while he pursues a nightclub singer.
Eddie Pink, meek drycleaner in a college town (and secret fan of entertainer Joyce Lennox), sends for an assertiveness course. Soon, he finds himself hired by his dunce friend's mother as manager of Dreamland, an amusement park menaced by slot-machine racketeers. Can Eddie, armed with his mail-order mentor's few simple rules, triumph over menacing mobsters and feminine wiles?
