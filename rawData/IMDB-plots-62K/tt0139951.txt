Turin at the end of the fifties: two brothers have emigrated there from Sicily and the older works very hard to let the younger study and free himself from poverty through culture. The boy however is not keen on school and would like to begin to work. When after some time he gets his degree however things take a violent and dramatic turn......
Six separate days, between 1958 and 1964, in the lives of Sicilian brothers. Giovanni, illiterate and hard working, arrives in Turino where young Pietro studies. Giovanni sacrifices so Pietro can become a teacher. There are deceptions: Pietro isn't much of a student. When Pietro finds some money, Giovanni refuses to celebrate; guilt finally penetrates Pietro's dandyism, and where the money ends up changes the fortunes of both. In shame for his school failure, Pietro disappears, which drives Giovanni nearly mad. Pietro's return brings the two as close as they'll ever be, yet the happiness cannot last. The brothers reunite, but appearances are deceiving. Whose sacrifice is greater?
