In offer to identify the face of Ji-woo's long lost first love, the two travel all around the country and come face-to-face with a smörgåsbord of Kim Jong-wook's. After days on end of little success in the search for Kim Jong-wook, the agency receives a single phone call of fate. An inquiry from none other than Kim Jong-wook himself, hoping to find Jin-woo through the help of Gi-joon's agency.
