Under the guise of a brutally honest documentary, this malevolent propaganda film aims to be an "indispensable tool in the hands of the Aryan race", designed to depict the "true" Jew when the masks of western civilisation fall off.
The Jews of Poland (invaded by Germany in 1939) are depicted as filthy, evil, corrupt, and intent on world domination. Street scenes are shown prejudicially, along with clips from Jewish cinema of the day and photos of Jewish celebrities, while the narrator "explains" the Jewish problem. The climax and resolution of the film is Hitler's 1939 announcement that the Jewish race will meet its "annihilation" (Vernichtung).
Under the guise of an informative and brutally honest documentary, Der Ewige Jude--part of the Third Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels' late-1930s anti-Semitic campaign--insidiously attempts to portray the true colours of the world Jewry through harsh but undiluted "facts". Sinister, filled with hatred, and dark, the Eternal Jew twists and bends the truth by amalgamating demeaning stereotypes with abominable fabrications, using inflammatory raw footage taken from the Jewish ghettoes right after the Nazi occupation of Poland. Aiming to be an "indispensable tool in the hands of the Aryan race", the film is designed to depict the "true" Jew when the masks of western civilisation fall off, going as far as to make the revolting comparison of Jews to parasitic packs of rats. Indeed, movies such as this particularly malevolent propaganda film narrated by newsreel voice-over actor, Harry Giese, were invaluable to Adolf Hitler who used them to condition the German people to the pressing matter of the Jewish Question.
