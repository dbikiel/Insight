A reclusive author of spiritual books is pursued for advice by a single mother and a man fresh out of rehab.
Everyone wants to meet Arlen Faber, the world famous author of the best-selling spiritual book "Me and God," but crotchety, disgruntled Arlen simply wants to be left alone - and so far he's been successful in keeping his identity a secret. But all that changes when troubled bookstore owner Kris Lucas discovers his home address and barters books for Arlen's words of wisdom, and a back injury leads the reclusive writer to begin dating chiropractor and overprotective single mother Elizabeth. As Arlen's relationships with his newfound friends begin to grow, he must come to terms with his past and the realization that he doesn't hold all the answers.
