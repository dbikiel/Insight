In the cold, wintery fields of New England, a lonely old house wakes up every thirty years - and demands a sacrifice.
After their teenage son is killed in a car crash, Paul (Andrew Sensenig) and Anne (Barbara Crampton) move to the quiet New York countryside to try to start a new life for themselves. But the grieving couple unknowingly becomes the prey of a family of vengeful spirits that reside in their new home, and before long they discover that the seemingly peaceful town they've moved into is hiding a terrifyingly dark secret. Now they must find a way to overcome their sorrow and fight back against both the living and dead as the malicious ghosts threaten to pull their souls - and the soul of their lost son - into hell with them.
After the death of their adult son, Anne and her husband, Paul, move into a nineteenth century country house. In spite of the sinister history described by their new neighbor, Anne remains convinced that she feels the presence of their son in the new house. When she invites her new agey friends to investigate the spiritual presence, the house's malevolent secret comes to light.
