British punk duo Sleaford Mods have been called "the voice of Britain" by their fans, "Britain's angriest band" by the Guardian and "The world's greatest rock 'n' roll band" by Iggy Pop. "Bunch of Kunst" follows them on their two-year journey from Nottingham bedroom recording sessions to chart success.
