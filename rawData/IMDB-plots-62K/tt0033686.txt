A man who lived his life as he was was told he should, not as he would have chosen to, is brought out of his shell by a beautiful young woman.
Fortysomething, blue blooded Boston born and bred, Harvard educated businessman Harry Pulham leads a regimented, routinized life with his wife, the former Kay Motford, who he's known since childhood. Harry outwardly believes he is all the more happy because of the way his life is, which was somewhat predetermined as part of his upbringing. This day, he receives two telephone calls which make him examine his life. The first is from Bo-Jo Brown, a Harvard colleague who is heading a twenty-five year reunion committee, with Harry foisted into the job of writing attendee biographies, which is to include his own. The second is from Marvin Myles, a former work colleague from his time over twenty years ago at the J.T. Bullard Advertising Agency in New York City, that job which Harry got from his more liberally minded Harvard friend Bill King. The result of these two telephone calls makes Harry wonder if he is happy, if he is or ever was in love with Kay, and if he never was if he would have been much happier if he stayed in New York with the girl he let get away, she, originally from humble means, who was not willing to live what she saw as Harry's blue blooded life in Boston. In the process, Harry will also find if he can turn back the clock twenty years or if there is a way to move forward to achieve that happiness which he now realizes is missing from his life.
