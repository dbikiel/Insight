Sequel to the cult Russian animation Bremenskie muzykanty (1969)
The King, wanting to return his daughter to the palace, hires a Detective. Taking with him the guards of the king, he travels by car to perform the task. The Bremen Town Musicians rest in the meadow and sing, while the Princess collects flowers. Suddenly, the king's guards, who were under a hay, kidnap her. But Troubadour and his friends - the Donkey, the Dog, the Cat and the Rooster - rush to rescue the Princess from the golden cage. To divert the attention of the King and the Detective, they disguise themselves as singers and parody popular western rock bands. The Troubadour, taking advantage of the turmoil, enters the palace and saves his love.
