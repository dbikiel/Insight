Malm√∂, Sweden during the Second World War. Stig is a 15 year old pupil on the verge of adulthood. Viola is 37 years old and his teacher. He is attracted by her beauty and maturity. She is drawn to him by his youth and innocence, a god-sent relief from her drunk and miserable husband. They start a passionate and forbidden relationship - but it has consequences they never could have expected.
All things fair takes place in 1943. Stig meets his teacher, Viola. His life changes forever. They start an affair. She is 37, and he is 15, but that makes no difference to them. Viola's husband is always drunk and unfaithful, so she thinks her own affair is therefore justified. The girl next door, however, also shares love for Stig and is disappointed he never notices her. The affair grows dangerous, and Viola is risking everything. Then one day Stig realizes love does exist with someone his own age, and Viola lets him pay dearly for his realization....
