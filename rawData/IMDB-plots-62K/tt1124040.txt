A pair of newspaper reporters receive help from an unlikely accomplice in their effort to stave off an alien invasion.
In Boston, there is an unknown epidemic and the population is consuming the Hydropure water and vegetables from Whitefield Corporation. The City Hall Secretary, Taylor Lambert, contacts a newspaper journalist, Lisa Wallace, expecting to give evidence of a conspiracy that his partner Connie is collecting. However, Glenda is captured and murdered by the guards, and Lambert shoots the Mayor and takes a sample of his blood to give to Lisa. Lambert is hunted and wounded by the police. He meets the journalist, Ben Mosher, who writes for the sensationalist column 'Mystery Science' in the same newspaper. Lambert gives Ben a vial with the Major's blood before he dies and Ben gives the sample to his friend Knutt Jourgensen for analysis.
