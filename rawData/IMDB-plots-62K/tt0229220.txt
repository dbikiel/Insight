The 'Little Sure Shot' of the 'Wild West.' Exhibition of Rifle Shooting at Glass Balls, etc. (from the Edison Catalog)
Annie get your guns. Standing on the left-hand corner of the stage, wearing a cowboy hat, a skirt with fringe at the hem, and a jacket with fringe hanging from the sleeves, Annie Oakley takes a rifle from her assistant, turns, and rapidly fires six shots, cocking the gun after each one, hitting six targets on a board at the other side of the stage. Then, as her assistant moves quickly to the target side of the stage and kneels down, Annie changes guns. The assistant tosses small clay pigeons in the air, one at a time, directly above his head; Annie takes aim and pulverizes each one. She's finished her seventh of these shots when the reel ends.
