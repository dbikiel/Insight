For a few weeks each year, in the depths of winter, senior students at the National Ballet School of Canada are treated to a style of dance that is unlike any other - flamenco.
Students in their final year at the National Ballet School of Canada are seen learning the flamenco from Susana and Antonio Robledo, who come to the school every winter to conduct classes which are held after the day's regular schedule has ended.
After their regular classes, the students at the National Ballet School of Canada are participating in a series of special classes in the late afternoon on flamenco dancing. These classes are taught by renowned flamenco dancer and teacher Susana Robledo and her longtime accompanist husband Antonio Robledo. The sessions will use many of the skills possessed by the dancers and build upon some of those important in flamenco, most specifically rhythm. As trained dancers, the students pick up most of the steps easily, however Susana can tell that many of the students are scared and apprehensive as flamenco requires a different emotion than ballet.
