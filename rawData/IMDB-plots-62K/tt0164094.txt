In a small Greek village, short time after the collapse of the Junta regime, a memorial of those who died in the German occupation of Greece brings in the surface the political differences of a conservative teacher and his two sons.
In the wake of the far-right Greek military junta, a storm is brewing in a rugged and secluded Arcadian village. Traditional, stern, and conservative, the unwavering headmaster of the local gymnasium, Periklis Papachristoforou, will find himself in the eye of the storm, when--during the unveiling of a WWII memorial--the name of the Resistance fighter, Christos Kanavos, is deliberately omitted from the wall. As a result, the clash between his liberal teacher wife and his two progressive sons is inevitable; however, who has the guts to admit the naked truth?
