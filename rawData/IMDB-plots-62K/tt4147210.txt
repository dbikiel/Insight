Two young women terrorized by a group of small town psychos seek revenge on their tormentors.
Two young women, Sloane and Katie, head out to rural America to work on an eco farm. They need the money so they can go on a shopping holiday to New York. They are offered a ride to the farm by some friendly local young men. Turns out the men's intentions aren't all friendly and they are soon held prisoner by them. They escape and plan their revenge. Meanwhile, the uncle of one of the girls, an FBI detective, suspects something is wrong and comes looking for them.
Katie and her best friend, the promiscuous Sloane, travel to perform philanthropic work in organic farming for a month and then go shopping in New York for a week. Katie's mother is traveling on vacation to Cuba and her brother Jason, who is an FBI agent, will drive the girls to the farm. He asks Katie to contact him every day using a code and leaves the girls in a bus stop to the farm on the road. However they accept a ride to the farm from the amicable locals Jed and Lucas in a bar. However they kidnap the two girls and leave them half-naked and chained to containers in the middle of nowhere. Then they bring bizarre clients and force Katie and Sloane to prostitute for them. Meanwhile Jason looks for Katie and Sloane since he received messages without the code and contact Sheriff Andrews, who is also part of the criminal ring. When Katie and Sloane succeed to escape, they seek revenge against the gang.
