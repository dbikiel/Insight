When a street drug turns junkies into an army of zombies, a man named Hunter finds himself with nothing but a beat-up car and a trunk full of guns and booze, until he stumbles across a small band of survivors.
Zombie Hunter is set in a post-apocalyptic Zombie wasteland caused by the mysterious street drug "Natas". We follow one man who has nothing left other than a beat up Camaro and a trunk full of guns and booze. He runs down Flesh Eaters, hunting for sport and redemption, while also running from his past. After crashing into a small group of survivors, who are running low on resources, he decides to lend a hand. But a surprise attack by the Flesh Eaters forces them on the run and puts the Hunter's skills to the test.
A new street drug called NATAS unleashes a zombie apocalypse that spreads like wildfire and mutates its users into flesh eaters. With nothing left but a beat-up Camaro and trunk full of guns &amp; booze, Hunter (Martin Copping) spends his day running down the flesh eaters for sport and redemption from his tortured past. After crashing into a small group of survivors, led by an ax-wielding priest named Jes√∫s (Danny Trejo), Hunter is seduced into escorting the eclectic group (strippers, rednecks, and in innocent beauty) to a mythical place of refuge. Under constant assault from zombies and a chain-saw wielding psychotic clown, a surprise attack by a new breed of giant mutant flesh eaters forces them to abandon their quest, and put Hunter's skills to the test.
