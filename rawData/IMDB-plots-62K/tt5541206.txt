Inès, 35 years old, is a photographer. She is in an emotionally fragile phase and begins putting together a book of personal poems and photographs. Gradually, the process of bringing a book to fruition becomes a very personal and unfettered exploration of her past: of her relationship with her mother; the role of the family home in the south, which seems to have been frozen in time; and how the absence of her father - who disappeared in 1977 during the dictatorship - influenced all of those years.
Inés, a 35 year-old photographer, is expecting a child and is in an emotionally vulnerable state. Her imminent motherhood drives her to finish a book of personal photos and poems she has been working on. The process of making this photobook gradually transforms into a very personal and free exploration of her past, her relationship with her mother and her brother, and the absence of her father, who disappeared during the military dictatorship in Argentina.
