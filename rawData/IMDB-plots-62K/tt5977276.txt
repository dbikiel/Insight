Post World War II, a British colonel and his wife are assigned to live in Hamburg during the post-war reconstruction, but tensions arise with the German who previously owned the house.
Set in postwar Germany in 1946, Rachael Morgan (Keira Knightley) arrives in the ruins of Hamburg in the bitter winter, to be reunited with her husband Lewis (Jason Clarke), a British colonel charged with rebuilding the shattered city. But as they set off for their new home, Rachael is stunned to discover that Lewis has made an unexpected decision: They will be sharing the grand house with its previous owners, a German widower (Alexander Skarsg√•rd) and his troubled daughter. In this charged atmosphere, enmity and grief give way to passion and betrayal.
The film takes place in Germany after the Second World War. The country is going through a very difficult time: around devastation and famine. Lewis Morgan is a British military soldier appointed by the command as interim mayor of Hamburg. This person has to raise the city from scratch. He arrives here with his wife, with whom he settles in a luxurious mansion. A German architect also lives in it with his emotionally unstable daughter. This man is also working to rebuild the city.
