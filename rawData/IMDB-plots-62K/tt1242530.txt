A young man has only ten days to locate his soulmate as dictated by the stars, otherwise he could lose a fortune. He thus embarks on a journey through love, looking through twelve girls to find the one who fits his horoscope.
What's Your Raashee? Yogesh Patel, a young man in a hurry. Yogesh must find his dream girl within 10 days to save his family from utter ruin. Finding the dream girl is tough enough. Finding her in a hurry is even tougher.
Chicago-based Yogesh Patel is called home to Mumbai, given news from his brother, Jeetendra, that their father, Bharatbhai, is gravely ill. He rushes home to find his father hale and hearty and himself duped. They need him to marry a Gujarati girl within ten days (thereby inheriting his grandfather's fortune) or let his heavily debt-ridden brother (and later himself as well) get seriously injured by the violent load-shark Moolrajbhai. Yogesh agrees under one condition: He must meet one girl from every Zodiac sign to find the one he is destined to marry. Humorous complications arise as he's thrust into uncontrollable situations with assorted girls (all bearing the same face) and their parents/relatives, additionally amidst conjectures that one of Yogesh's male relatives is having an affair with one of the girls.
