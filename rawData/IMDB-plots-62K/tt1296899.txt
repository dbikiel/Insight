The parents of a girl who was killed by a savage dog are granted the opportunity to spend three days with their deceased daughter.
Still grieving the death of nine-year-old Alice - their only child - at the jaws of a crazed dog, vet Patrick and pharmacist Louise relocate to the remote town of Wake Wood where they learn of a pagan ritual that will allow them three more days with Alice. The couple find the idea disturbing and exciting in equal measure, but once they agree terms with Arthur, the village's leader, a far bigger question looms - what will they do when it's time for Alice to go back?
After the death of their beloved daughter Alice by a savage dog, the veterinary Patrick and the pharmacist Louise move to Wake Wood, a small town in the countryside. Patrick befriends the local leader Arthur and the couple grieves the death of Alice. Sooner Louise witnesses part of a bloody ritual in the woods and they learn that the villagers practice a pagan ritual to bring back to life the beloved deceased one for three days for a better farewell within the first month of the casualty and within the village limits. Patrick and Louise accept the conditions and lie to Arthur about the date that Alice died. They succeed in resuscitating Alice but something goes deadly wrong.
