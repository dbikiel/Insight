Based on a true story, "Bingo" is a film about the man behind the mask. Augusto is an actor hungry for a place in the spotlight, following the footsteps of his mother, a stage artist in the 50's. While starring in soft porn and soap operas he finally gets the chance to conquer the crowds when he is cast as "BINGO", a television host clown. With his irreverent humor and natural talent, the show is a big hit, but a clause on his contract forbids him to reveal his true identity. Augusto becomes an anonymous celebrity. With makeup on, he brings happiness to children across the country but not to his own son Gabriel, that sees his father distancing himself in search of recognition. Filled with irony and humor and an exaggerated pop look from the backstage universe of the Brazilian 80's television, the film tells the incredible and surreal story of a man that whilst looking for his artistic value, finds his personal decay.
