To bring down a global human trafficking ring, an Interpol agent recruits the help of a brutal criminal with inside knowledge of the yakuza.
A young boy, nicknamed Darc, witnesses his mother murdered by a Yakuza boss. Several years later and the boy is a man, and has just been released from jail. An Interpol agent organised his early release: he wants Darc to find his daughter who has been kidnapped by the same Yakuza boss. Darc now has two reasons to hunt the man down.
