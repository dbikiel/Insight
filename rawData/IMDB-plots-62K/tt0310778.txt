An actress, a writer, a student, and a government worker band together in an effort to escape Paris as the Nazis move into the city.
At the start of World War II, the fate of the free world hangs in the balance at the posh Hotel Splendide in Bordeaux. Cabinet members, journalists, physicists, and spies of all persuasions gather in order to escape the Nazi occupation of Paris. High society socialites hobnob with jailbirds. Murderous intrigues, scientific secrets and love affairs flourish.
In Paris, a few months before the Nazi invasion, the manipulative actress Viviane Denvers uses her former sweetheart Frédéric Auger to hide the body of a man killed by her. Frédéric hits the car, the dead man is found and he is sent to prison. When the Germans invade France, Frédéric escapes with another prisoner, Raoul, and they become friends. In the runaway to Bordeaux, they meet in the train Camille, the young assistant of the physicist Professeur Kopolski, who is trying to leave France with his research of heavy water. Once in Bordeaux, the group meets Viviane with her new lover, the minister of state Jean-Étienne Beaufort, and is chased by a German spy, the journalist Alex Winckler, while Paris is falling and the population is confused.
