General Daffy, in a Napoleon hat, commands a fort. Porky sleeps too soundly, so Daffy needs to roust him, but when the Indians attack, he's the only one awake to see them. There follows a series of fight gags, including some recycled from Johnny Smith and Poker-Huntas (1938) and The Hardship of Miles Standish (1940). A cross-eyed Indian keeps shooting his own horse, until the horse takes action. A soldier counts "one little, two little..." with the Indian taking the last line. A short Indian uses a tall bow-legged one to shoot his arrows. Finally, Porky calls for more bullets; Daffy trips while carrying them and swallows them, turning himself into a machine gun. Porky uses Daffy to rout the Indians, who run into a hillside, spelling out "Yanks beat Indians 11-3."
