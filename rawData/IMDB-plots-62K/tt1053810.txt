Two bird enthusiasts try to defeat the cocky, cutthroat world record holder in a year-long bird-spotting competition.
In birding, a Big Year is seeing or hearing as many different species of birds as possible in a calendar year. Three men pursue the Birder of the Year title: Kenny Bostick, who's seen a record 732 in a past big year, Stu Preissler, newly retired, and Brad Harris, who narrates the story. Life gets in the way: Bostick's wife wants a baby, Stu's firm needs him for sensitive negotiations, and Brad, divorced and underemployed at 36, has an encouraging mom and a disapproving dad. They criss-cross the continent (including a trip to Alaska's westernmost island), follow migration patterns, and head for storms that force birds to ground. Who will win, at what cost, and with what rewards?
Brad Harris (Jack Black) wants to become the greatest birder by winning the Big Year, a birding contest (not a photography contest). Kenny Bostick (Owen Wilson) is the current Big Year record holder, and other challengers abound, including Stu Preissler (Steve Martin), a retiring executive. Stu's family supports him, but Brad's father (Brian Dennehy) is not keen.The contestants travel all over North America (not the world), trying to see (or hear) the most birds. Bostick connives to throw others off, and Stu and Brad form an alliance. Stu's ex-coworkers try to get him back for a big deal, and Bostick's wife (Rosamund Pike) redecorates their house. They all hear of a storm, which will blow birds inland, and head to Houston. No one wants to admit they're chasing a Big Year, but they eventually find out about each other.Brad and Stu continue with their personal lives, but Kenny devotes all his time to birding. Brad's father begins to understand his passion. Stu and Brad begin to use Stu's resources to find birds, and Brad's father finds time to help his son.Even though Kenny wins the Big Year, Stu and Brad realize they've won more - friendship.
