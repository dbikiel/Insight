A young woman weds a seemingly charming young man, and moves into his ancient mansion. She quickly learns to hate the old mansion and its inhabitants, while she gets frustrated with her husband's secrecy on his late night activities and the contents of the dungeon below. As heads begin to roll she discovers about her husband's past and his connection to some cult called the Red Monks. However, wait till he finds about HER past.
Sort of loose remake of the late director Mario Bava's _Lisa e il diavolo (1974)_ about a group of witches who lure strangers into a haunted house to sacrifice.
