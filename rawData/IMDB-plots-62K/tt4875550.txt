A pandemic infects people everywhere with infinite lust, and the only ones who can save us are a group of astronauts in space, desperately looking for a solution.
Some sort of outbreak has hit planet Earth - libidos are through the roof and it's even affecting toys! Sounds like fun, but it's hardly good for productivity. Luckily a team are on the case, aiming to get to the bottom of the strange pandemic. They are a team of astronauts, out in space so as to be safe from the affliction.
