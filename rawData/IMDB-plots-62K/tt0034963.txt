A psychiatrist's patient, a nutty heiress, travels west to find gold in her grandfather's abandoned mine. The psychiatrist, unable to talk her out of it, decides to follow her out there.
Jane Palmer is suspected of insanity after squandering her inheritance, and a young psychiatrist, Dr. Enright, is assigned to her case. Posing as her chauffeur, he drives her out west to her rich grandmother, from whom Jane hopes to recoup her fortune. The grandmother refuses her money, but allows her to work the family's played-out gold mine. As part of his treatment, Enright "salts" the mine with gold and, unintentionally, brings on a gold-rush and a group of government assayers. They find the mine rich in mercury ore and new riches for Hope, who is now more interested in her "chauffeur."
