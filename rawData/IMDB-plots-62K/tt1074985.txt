A little mammoth is looking for his mother around the whole long been changed world.
An animation about the fate of a mammoth, who accidentally escaped the extinction of mammoths (froze in permafrost, and then thawed) and is now looking for his mother. Mammoth meets with a white bear and walrus. The old wise grandfather Walrus tells the mammoth that far to the south there is a huge continent where animals resembling him live, but without wool. Maybe his mom is there? A mammoth on an ice floe sets out on a long voyage across a vast ocean to find her.
