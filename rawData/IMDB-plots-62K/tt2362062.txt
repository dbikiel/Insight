Parvis, a fifty-year-old man who has lived his entire life with his father and never held a job, is suddenly, kicked out from his home, as his father decides to remarry.
Parviz is a man in his fifties who has lived his entire life in his father's home and never held a job. His days are spent in doing housework for his father and chores for the people of the residential complex in which they live. This quiet routine suddenly comes apart with his father's decision to remarry. He tells Parviz to move out and live in a place he has rented for him. When Parviz leaves the complex, the residents, who had previously cheerfully accepted his assistance, begin to treat him as a pariah. Under these alien conditions, the normally mild-mannered Parviz begins to discover the more forceful aspects of his personality. In discovering the violent power he can yield, he begins to show his father and the other residents that they cannot cast him out of their lives so easily.
