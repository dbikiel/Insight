Six people in Los Angeles recall their misadventures from the previous night at a club.
Ryan is the house DJ at a nightspot in Los Angeles that is enjoying a brief moment as the hippest joint in town. Ryan carries a torch for Cassie, a waitress who is hoping to launch a career as an actress. However, Cassie isn't as strongly attracted to Ryan, and she has no shortage of other potential suitors. As Ryan and Cassie try to sort out their feelings during one busy night, a number of other folks looking either for new love or a new hook-up make their way across the dance floor, including Tony, who has been propping up his failing film industry career with some illegal business; crystal meth enthusiast Delaney; Mick, who works his British charm for all it's worth; and Aubrey and Apple, who are friends with Cassie and are also struggling to get a break in showbiz.
In Los Angeles a group of twenty-something, nightclub-going friends, wake up after a wild night on the town to find their lives in chaos; as they contact each other to figure out just what happened the night before, they begin to understand that they're affecting each other in ways they couldn't possibly imagine.
