Ashley is a journalist and does makeovers for a TV show. Her editor offers her the job of being the editor of a new fashion supplement, provided she does a makeover on a sports writer, who is an uncouth, loudmouthed, sexist slob.
Award-winning sports columnist Pete is quite pleased with his slightly sleazy frat boy image and frolicking life style. Alas, the owner forces him to allow ambitious TV fashionista Ashley, who is used to perfectly-groomed fianc√© Christopher, to give Pete a makeover by the launch of his book, as his slouchy look won't do on promotion tour. His buddy Marty tests the dating potential. Learning about each-other's worlds, they may even fall in love.
