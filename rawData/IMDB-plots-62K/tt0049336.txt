A precocious young TV star steals Sach's and Duke's car, and they run up against some network executives when they go to find out what happened. The executives believe that the boys know how to handle the little brat, and hire them as the boy's companions, with the titles of Vice President. Soon afterward the boy's uncle and manager kidnap him for ransom, and Sach and Duke set out to rescue the boy.
