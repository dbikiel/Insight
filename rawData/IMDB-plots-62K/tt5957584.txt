In 1977, a girl is kidnapped and kept in a coffin-sized box. When her captors let her out, it's only to abuse her horribly. Will she ever escape?
May 1977. 20-year-old Colleen Stan is hitching from Oregon to California to visit friends. With a little over 40 miles of her journey left, she accepts a lift from a young couple, Cameron and Janice Hooker. It's a fateful decision. Kidnapped at knifepoint, Colleen spends the next seven years imprisoned for up to 23 hours a day in a coffin-sized box hidden beneath her captors' bed. When not incarcerated, she is employed as the Hooker's slave and child-minder, and is gradually drawn into a bizarre and complex world of extreme obsession and fantasy... Based on a true story, GIRL IN THE BOX is a dark psychological drama told through the eyes of one of the crime's perpetrators, Janice Hooker. Janice came under the spell of the likeable and charismatic Cameron when just sixteen: but Cameron harbours a dark secret: an insatiable addiction to extreme bondage and S&amp;M. Unable to cope with Cameron's ever more extreme demands, Janice strikes a deal: if Cameron will stop using her for his S&amp;M practices and let her have a child, she will allow him to keep a slave. It's a deal with the devil...
