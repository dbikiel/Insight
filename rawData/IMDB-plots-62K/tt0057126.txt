When Bugs takes the Roadrunner's place in a cartoon, the Bugs/Coyote roles and rules become confused.
Bugs, with the help of some Acme Super Speed Vitamins, is filling in for the roadrunner, who "sprained a giblet." Fortunately, even when the vitamins fail, Bugs can outwit the coyote, though as usual, the coyote outwits himself much of the time. Most complex gag: Wile E., atop a large cliff, has set out a target and a carrot. Bugs stops, the anvil drops, and Bugs appears atop the cliff, target in hand. He puts the target on Wile E.'s head, the anvil hits, and the cliff-side falls, taking Coyote with it. Bugs removes the target, the anvil falls and misses! Wile E., relieved, walks away into the path of a truck.
