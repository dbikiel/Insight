A small-time thief is recruited by the police to infiltrate a notorious gang in an effort to thwart an illegal cigarette smuggling scheme.
During 1960, cigarette was banned in India. In order to capture the powerful cigarette smuggler Nagaraj (Pradeep Rawat), Chennai police commissioner sends the small time thief Elisamy (Vadivelu) as a rat and he befriends with Kappal (Mahanadi Shankar), the right hand of Nagaraj. The agreement between the commissioner and Elisamy is that if the latter finds enough evidence to arrest Nagaraj, he will get his dream cop job. What happens next ?
