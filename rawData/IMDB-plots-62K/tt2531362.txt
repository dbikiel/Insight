Seven strangers find themselves unwitting participants in a U.S. government evacuation program gone horribly wrong.
Seven strangers wake aboard a passenger jet in mid-flight, with no idea how they got there - and no idea where they are headed. Cut off from the cockpit and with a dying smartphone as their sole source of communication, they learn the U.S. is under a devastating attack... and they might be the only survivors.
