Irene Dunne is married to Ralph Bellamy. Their union is comfortable but all that changes when Bellamy's old flame Constance Cummings comes back to town. Will the the thrill of loves past disrupt their happy home?
Traveling among the upper class upstate New York scene, Tony and Jim Dunlap are happily married with a son, two year old Jeremy Dunlap. Most of their friends see Tony as the perfect wife in her unending support of Jim. What could rock their world is that Jim's ex-fianc√©e, proverbial man eater Fran Harper, the sister of one of their friends Jud McCrae, he and his wife Bee McCrae who don't much like her, has just gotten a Reno divorce and is said to be on her way back to cause trouble as Fran has not yet made the divorce public, but once it hits the media, it will lead to a circus atmosphere for Jim and by association Tony in the scandal all over again of Fran having left Jim at the altar six years ago, the full story of which Tony is unaware. Fran does end up coming back, bringing along with her a poor cad named Mort Holmes, who she picked up at a speakeasy along the way. Fran has indeed come back to cause trouble, more specifically to steal Jim away from Tony for her own selfish reasons, those reasons which do not include being in love with him. Mort is solely a pawn in her scheme to make Jim jealous. Tony may be less naive about the situation than her husband as Tony's own mother was just like Fran. As such, Tony decides to take matters into her own hands, taking measures to neutralize Fran's, and hopefully, in the process, show Jim the true woman Fran is, which is not the poor innocent as she likes to portray.
Tony Dunlap (Irene Dunne) is married to Jim (Ralph Bellamy). Jims old flame Fran (Constance Cummings) comes to visit and causes all kinds of trouble. Jud McCrae (Charles Starrett) is Fran's brother and husband to Tony's best girlfriend Bee McCrae (Kay Johnson).
