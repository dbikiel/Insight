As the Beatles did in the 1960s, Michael Caine convinces Jack Nicholson, Joe Pesci, Al Pacino, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards to move to Stella Street, an unassuming residential area of Surrey. But along with the new neighbors come hoods and thieves, all determined to make off with the stars' cash. Based on the BBC sketch comedy series.
A satirical glimpse at the early 21st century in which impressionists Phil Cornwell and John Sessions send up celebrity culture, including: Keith Richards and Mick Jagger, who run a corner shop; Jack Nicholson and Al Pacino, who rub shoulders in a leafy lane in suburbia; and David Bowie, who has his underpants starched and ironed by an uptight cockney charlady named Mrs. Huggett. Megastars come and go, but nothing escapes the watchful eye of their long-suffering neighbor, Michael Caine.
