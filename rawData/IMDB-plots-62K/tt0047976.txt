This film, with no dialogue at all, follows a psychotic young woman's nightmarish experiences through one skid-row night.
As the narrator invites us to explore the horrors of an insane mind, a young woman wakes from a nightmare in a cheap hotel room. We follow her through the skid-row night and encounters with an abusive husband; a wino; a pimp and the rich man he panders for; a flashback to her traumatic childhood; violence; pursuit through dark streets; dementia. Filmed in film-noir style throughout; only the narrator speaks.
MAYBE: A girl lies on a bed in a cheap hotel room. She gets dressed and goes into the street. She walks through dark alleys. She is assaulted by a drunk.A cop arrives and brutally attacks the drunk. The girl is led to a limousine where a fat, disgusting and obviously rich man is sitting in the back seat. They make the rounds of various nightclubs catering to jazz and beatniks. They go to the man's apartment. After eating a heavy, greasy meal, most of which is on the man's hands and face, the man attempts to rape her. She plunges a knife into his stomach and he falls out the window, tearing a necklace from her throat as he hurtles to his death on the pavement below. The girl rushes to the street where she sees a crowd gathered around the corpse. The necklace is still clutched in his hand. Unable to pry the hand open, she cuts it off at the wrist. A detective arrives. The girl flees. Pursued by a police-car she runs through the darkened streets. She finds refuge in a nightclub where Shorty Rogers and his Jazz Band are performing. The detective arrives and all eyes are directed toward the girl. She is assaulted by insane laughter and pointing fingers of accusation. She awakens in her hotel room. She opens a dresser drawer. She finds....Maybe.
