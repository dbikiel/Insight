Reassigned to a lowly outpost, a Roman guard's Christian beliefs clash with his gay commander's desire for closeness. Being tortured becomes pleasurable.
300 A.D. : the Roman Sebastianus is exiled to a remote outpost populated exclusively by men. Weakened by their desires, these men turn to homosexual activities to satisfy their needs. However, Sebastianus becomes the target of lust for a homosexual centurion, but he rejects the man's advances.
For adhering to Christian beliefs, favored Roman soldier Sebastian is banished to a lowly, isolated outpost where a handful of scantily clad fellow soldiers have long since satisfied their personal needs through homosexual acts. For refusing both an order to fight and a request for physical intimacy, Centurion Severus has Sebastian tortured, whereby Sebastian finds ecstasy, a friend, and death.
