A pill-popping, over-caffeinated driver accidentally hits something. Panic-stricken, he searches for help in a strange and desolate town that offers very little in the form of human kindness.
Sleep-deprived, low on gas and anxious to get home, a pill-popping driver high on caffeine, passes through a wintry small town but he gets distracted for only a second, and as a result, he hits what appears to be a china mannequin. Much to his surprise, the whole town is populated by inanimate mannequins, strangely, however, a set of eyes seems to be glued on his back, watching his every move. Soon, a siren wails, but for whom?
Nathan, a lad in his teens, is driving alone through a winter landscape. His pill bottle is beside him; he pops a few. He's almost out of gas. He reaches a town, and while staring at someone sitting at a bus stop, he runs over someone. He gets out of the car: it seems to be a lifeless mannequin. He goes for help to a caf√©; everyone's a mannequin, and when he looks away, they move their positions. He hears sirens. He runs home. What's he to do; is it a nightmare?
