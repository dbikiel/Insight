Awaiting for Orpheus to save her from a modern Hades, Euridice faces her fears, desires, hallucinations and memories.
Euridice lives imprisoned in a house -Hades- in a country with dictatorship, waiting ''to be transfered somewhere else''. Those, however, who plan the ''transfers'', fool her for days or years. Her loved one, lost for years -Orpheus- calls her and asks to see her again. Euridice accepts him with hope and fear for the upcoming change. Orpheus comes as a new death, however, and not as a liberator. Euridice will kill him and remain forever in her hell.
