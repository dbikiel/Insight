How far would you go for the music you love?
Blackhearts takes a fresh look at the notorious Norwegian black metal music scene - but from a striking new angle. It travels to South America, Europe and the Middle East to follow three black metal die hards who hail from extreme religious and political backgrounds. Hector, Kaiadas and Sina are willing to risk alienation, imprisonment - even death - to play black metal and live by its ideology. They worship the Norwegian black metal music they have modeled their lives around. Blackhearts takes its audience deep into the minds, hearts and private lives of its characters. It explores how a music scene develops across religious, cultural and political lines - and provides comic relief on the things humans say, think and do when hijacked by passion.
BLACKHEARTS follows three die hard black metal fans from Colombia, Iran and Greece as they risk their life, end up in jail and sell their soul to Satan as they pursue the dream of bringing their band to the unholy birthplace of black metal - Norway.
