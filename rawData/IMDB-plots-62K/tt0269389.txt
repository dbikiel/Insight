The Lebanese immigrant worker Roro (Fares Fares) and his Swedish colleague and best friend Måns (Torkel Petersson) work in a park in Sweden. Roro and his Swedish girlfriend Lisa (Tuva Novotny) are in love for each other, and Lisa wants to be introduced to his family. Måns is having erection problem with his mate, but is looking for alternative methods to resolve the situation, since he is afraid of going to the doctor. When Roro finally decides to present Lisa to his family, they arrange a wedding for him with the Lebanese Yasmin (Laleh Pourkarim). Yasmin and Roro agree to pretend that they are going to get married to relieve the pressure of their families, leading them to a great confusion.
Jalla! Jalla!, which is arabic for "hurry! hurry!", takes place in the hot days of summer. Roro and Måns are two best friends who work as park attendants, scooping dogpoop from the flowerbeds and thinking of themselves as the coolest of the crop. But everything is not as it seems, Måns is having potency problems and Roro... When Roro finally is about to dare to introduce his swedish girlfriend to his, as he fears, traditional family he walks into a flat full of people planning for his arranged marriage to a sweet girl, who'd else get sent back to Lebanon. Whilst he is busy balancing keeping up appearances to help her, stalling the wedding plans and maintaining the relationship with his unknowing girlfriend, Måns is trying to fix his problem, using all kinds of methods.
