An American woman travels to England to seek a divorce from her absentee husband, where she meets - and falls for - a dashing performer.
Mimi Glossop wants a divorce so her Aunt Hortense hires a professional to play the correspondent in apparent infidelity. American dancer Guy Holden meets Mimi while visiting Brightbourne (Brighton) and she thinks he is the correspondent. The plot is really an excuse for song and dance. The movie won three Academy nominations and the first Oscar for Best Song: "The Continental", a twenty-two minute production number.
After staying in Paris on vacation, the American dancer Guy Holden and his Londoner lawyer friend Egbert Fitzgerald return to London by ship. Guy meets the wealthy American blonde Mimi Glossop, who is traveling with her aunt Hortense Ditherwell, in the harbor and Mimi asks him to call her aunt to open her luggage since her dress is trapped in the trunk. Guy tries to release her dress but he accidentally rips Mimi's dress. Guy lends his overcoat to her, expecting to receive it back with a thank-you note with her name and address, but Mimi returns the coat without any card. Meanwhile, Hortense seeks out Egbert, who is replacing his father in the office, expecting to get the divorce of Mimi and her husband, the geologist Cyril Glossop (William Austin). However, Egbert advises that it would be difficult to make Cyryl accept the divorce and he suggests to Mimi to hire the "correspondent" Rodolfo Tonetti to stay with her in a hotel room. Meanwhile, Egbert would hire private eyes to arrive in Mimi's room and surprise the couple, forcing the divorce of Mimi and Cyril. Egbert gives a password to Tonetti to identify Mimi and uses a sentence created by Guy - "Chance Is the Fool's Name for Fate". Mimi believes that Guy is her correspondent and stays with him in her room. When Tonetti arrives in her room, the disappointed Mimi learns the truth and feels better. But she is still married and can not marry Guy.
