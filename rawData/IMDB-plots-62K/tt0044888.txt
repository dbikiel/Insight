Florence and Chet Keefer have had a troublesome marriage. Whilst in the middle of a divorce hearing the judge encourages them to remember the good times they have had hoping that the marriage can be saved.
Chet Keefer and Florrie Keefer n√©e Derringer are in front of Judge Anne B. Carroll, who is in the middle of hearing their divorce petition. At the end of the day's proceedings which are to be continued the next morning, the judge asks to see the couple in her chambers without their lawyers. Sensing that their marriage can be saved by what she has seen and heard thus far, the judge changes roles to unofficial marriage counselor without telling them her plan. In Chet and Florrie talking openly and candidly about their life together which admittedly has had its up and downs, the downs complete with tragedy, the judge, who believes the adage "there are three sides to every story: yours, his and the truth", hopes that they can get to the truth by at least seeing the rationale and/or perspective of other's version of the story, with the goal that she can take their case off tomorrow morning's docket.
