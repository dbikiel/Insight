During the 1980s, Soviet authorities hunt for a serial killer who picks his victims in railway stations and commuter trains and lures them into the woods.
Based on the true story of a Russian serial killer who, over many years, claimed over 50 victims, mostly under the age of 17. In what was then a Communist state, the police investigations were hampered by bureaucracy, incompetence and those in power. The story is told from the viewpoint of the detective in charge of the case.
Viktor Burakov (Steven Rea) is a low-level police detective following a puzzling series of murders in his district. He believes they may be the work of a serial killer, but his Communist bosses don't agree. The Party line is that serial killing is a "decadent, Western phenomenon." But as the body count increases, Burakov notices a distinct pattern.He eventually catches up to the killer, but is stymied because the man is a low-level Communist Party member and the Party protects him. Eventually, Communism collapses and Burakov is appointed head of the investigation. He brings in a psychiatrist, who writes a deep analysis of the type of person involved. Burakov's superior contacts the FBI, discovering that Burakov is legendary because of his insight and dedication. They identify a man, Citizen Chikatilo and arrest him. The psychiatrist meets with Chikatilo and through his reactions, they realize he is the guilty party.
