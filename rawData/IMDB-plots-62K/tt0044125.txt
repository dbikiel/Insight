A stewardess becomes romantically involved with an airline pilot, a college professor, and a successful businessman, all of whom are named Mike. When the three find out about each other, she has to decide which one she loves the most.
Small-town girl Marcy Lewis is accepted by Americal Airlines into their flight-attendant's school to become a air-hostess/stewardess, followed by her training events leading up to her first flight, which has to return to the airport because the stewardess forgot to check if there was any food aboard. She jumps from training to romancing, and soon has three suitors, all named Mike; Michael Lawrence, a poor, struggling scientist; Mike Jamison, an airline pilot; and Mike Tracy, an advertising executive. The keyword here for who she chooses is....cast-order.
