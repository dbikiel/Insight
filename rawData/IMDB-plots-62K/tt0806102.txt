Jeff and his characters Walter, Peanut, José Jalapeño, Bubba J, and Sweet Daddy Dee for a live show.
As straight man to some of the most hilarious pint-sized partners in show business, Jeff Dunham has become one of the most successful touring comics ever and has amassed legions of loyal fans! At the American Comedy Awards, Dunham was voted Male Stand-Up Comic of the Year, an honor shared with the likes of Jerry Seinfeld, Jeff Foxworthy and Robin Williams. Thousands of sold-out theater and comedy club performances, his own top-rated special on Comedy Central and countless TV guest spots - including numerous Tonight Show appearances (with both Leno and Carson) - have won him accolades and success. The reason why is very simple: he and his buddies are funny as hell. Oh, and by the way... Jeff Dunham is a ventriloquist.
