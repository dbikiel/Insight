A honeymooning couple become entangled in a plot to recover plates for counterfeiting U.S. dollars. She thinks she's just retired from a government "dirty jobs" department, but her superiors have other ideas. He thinks she's a retired travel agent. Set in Spain, there's a constant flow of visual jokes, mainly at the expense of a group of incompetent thieves who are in hot pursuit of the plates. Many of the jokes are predictable, but there's enough to keep almost everyone amused.
