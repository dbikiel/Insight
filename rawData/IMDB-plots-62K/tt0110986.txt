Simon is a street retailer, his shop a corner on the lower east side in New York, his stock bootleg cassette tapes,the ambience a boombox. He scrounges food from restaurants, exists on vodka and beans, sleeps on the floor, and cares for an unloved cat. Marty, who may be an old girlfriend, visits. Down and out New York, unlovely and violent.
