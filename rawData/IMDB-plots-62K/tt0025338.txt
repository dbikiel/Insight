Story of a waitress whose life, despite a host of male admirers and even some intrigued movie talent scouts, ends up taking a stiflingly domestic turn after a wealthy businessman accidentally hits her with his car.
On her way to meet her boyfriend, Sugiko is hit by a car and hospitalized. When she doesn't arrive at the meeting place, her boyfriend believes she has betrayed him, and he returns to his hometown. Yamauchi, the man who was driving the car that hit her, proposes to her. Sugiko marries Yamauchi, but is bored with his family's lifestyle. She leaves him and goes back to work as a waitress.
