The film talks about a family that weathers all sorts of disasters and keeps going in spite of it all. It is noted for its wonderful assortment of oddball characters.
Mr. Win Berry Berry tries to run rural small town Dairy's high-school and his sassy family. The troubles of his sons Frank, a gay bullied by team idolized football captain Chip Dove, horny athlete John and 'Egg', so called after his growth-stopping syndrome, and daughters, inspire him to try running a hotel instead. After more problems, they accept a shady offer to run a Viennese hotel, but that proves a run-down rat-hole and terrorist layer, where disaster lays in waiting. Offspring talents also open positive avenues, which also prove mixed blessing.
