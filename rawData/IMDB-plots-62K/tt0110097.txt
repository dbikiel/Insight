An aspiring actor has his life turned upside down when his ex-wife dumps off their bossy, wild daughter into his custody.
Matt Hobbs is a talented but unsuccessful actor. When estranged (and strange) ex-wife Beth dumps their daughter Jeannie on Matt, father and daughter have a lot of adjusting to do. His budding relationship with attractive production assistant Cathy Breslow is made complicated, while the precocious child is overly accustomed to getting her own way. Matt eventually faces the choice of family versus career in a particularly difficult way.
This movie is about an actor that has had trouble getting a job in the past two years. His ex-wife is forcing him to take his daughter home with him, despite the fact that he has no money. Little does he know, she won't be staying for the "three weeks" his ex requested, she will be staying for a few years.
