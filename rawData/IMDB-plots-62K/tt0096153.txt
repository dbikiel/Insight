A group of people are killed one by one while participating at a million dollar treasure hunt in a mysterious Italian castle.
Winning a trip to Italy through a contest, Jackie (O'Grady) and her brother Tom (Pruett) join other winners Myrna (Demson), Yvette (Lind), Terri (Ulrich), Harlan (Zorek) and Tony (Modugno). They settle into the rooms of an old castle, together with Cassandra (Bailey), a rock star playing along in the contest. Wanting to get a leg up on each other, they all try to sneak out and find the prize before it starts, to no avail. When the contest begins, they start to die one-by-one from a mysterious source within the castle. Figuring that evil forces are at work, the remaining members race to stop the assailant from finishing their work.
