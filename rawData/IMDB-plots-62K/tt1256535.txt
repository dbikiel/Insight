Marcelle Toing, owner of the best restaurant in Rio de Janeiro, must go on missions to steal ingredients from human restaurants to keep his meals the best.
In this shameless rip-off of Ratatouille (2007), master-chef Marcell Toing runs the greatest restaurant in all of Brazil: The Ratatoing. In its 45-minute running time, the film consists of talking, padding, more padding and some of the most memorably incompetent characters in animation history.
