Wise king Christoph intends to abdicate and enjoy a carefree twilight, but has no son and hesitates to enthrone either of his daughters, the eldest two Isabella and Eugenia having flawed characters and petty obsessions, while junior princess Am√©lie more resembles their berated mother, queen Louisa. The king plans to let the crown go to the daughter who makes the most convincing declaration of pious love for him, but while hers sisters claim to love him more then their beloved jewels viz. fashion, Amelie infuriates him by saying 'as a daughter can only lover father, more precious then salt', he stays on and banishes her 'until salt proves more valuable'. She wanders off, disguised as journeyman Anton, still tempting fate with her smart mouth, but resolves to return after meeting again wandering African 'prince' Tabor on his natural science expedition, who lusts for her since a sharp-tongued meeting, and loyalty markers are called as true feelings combine with a ruinous salt shortage.
