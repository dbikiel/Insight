A psychiatrist and nurse overthrow the abusive heads of a girls' reform school in order to teach the "unfortunate" young women that they have a chance at healthy lives.
Idealistic and naive Dr. Jason arrives at a school for delinquent girls and immediately begins to try to make a difference in the lives of some of the inmates. Oblivious to the sadistic treatment of the girls by the matrons, it takes a rebellious girl named Loretta to open his eyes. Assisted by a female staff member, Jason finally gets proof of the abuse and threatens the head of the school with exposure unless he is given full reign to run things.
Troubled, young girls serving time in a reform school quickly realize after arriving, they are now in a world run by a militant tyrant who will go to any lengths to keep her "prison" in line. When a psychoanalyst begins investigating the cruel nature of his colleagues, he finds slave-driving, unimaginable punishments, and brutality. With the help of a female coworker he strives to make drastic changes within this hostile institution, by using kindness, reason, and influence.
