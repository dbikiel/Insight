Wagon train survivors of an Apache attack entrust the sheriff's prisoner, scout Comanche Todd, with their lives despite his wanted-for-murder status.
Accused of murdering three of Sheriff Bull Harper's brothers, the Comanche-reared white man, "Comanche" Todd, is captured and dragged to trial. Cautiously, as the two men ride across hostile Apache territory, they will join Colonel Normand's wagon train of women and children, only to be ambushed and massacred by the Indians whose families were slaughtered by the whites. Now, the few survivors have no other choice but to trust their dubious protector, Todd, as hundreds of vengeful Apaches track them down, thirsting for blood. Can they make it out alive?
When a handful of settlers survive an Apache attack on their wagon train they must put their lives into the hands of Comanche Todd, a white man who has lived with the Comanches most of his life and is wanted for the murder of three men.
