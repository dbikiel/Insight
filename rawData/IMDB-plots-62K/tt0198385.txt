Kyle Dean was a misfit in her North Carolina school. She was called "Creature" because she was a boy who knew she was a girl in part of the country where such things were not understood or tolerated. As soon as she could she left North Carolina for Hollywood where she felt that she'd stand more of a chance of becoming who she wanted to be. Now as Stacey she's going back to visit with with Mom and Pop.
