The animated film about hardworking ant and windy dragonfly. While the ant was carrying building materials for a multi-flat anthill on his truck, the dragonfly was basking in its crib. She was very unhappy that the ant prevented her from sleeping, and when the wheel of the truck got stuck in the web, she not only did not help the ant, but rather confused him even more. So the whole summer passed: the ants built an anthill and stocked up food for the winter, and the dragonfly slept for half a day and in the evening flew to dancing with the mosquitoes. It is not difficult to guess that with the arrival of winter, the frozen and hungry dragonfly went for help to the ant.
