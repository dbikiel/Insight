The minister of the town has died and his son Chad has no tears for him. Sarah, who now calls herself Salome, is pregnant with Chad's baby, but Chad has no future, no job and no money. Therefore, she leaves town on the train heading East. On the train she meets Tony who is heading back to Yale. Tony and his sister Catherine have one thing in common; they are both young, rich and bored with their lives. Salome goes to Yale with Tony and they are soon married, but she does not tell him about Chad or the pregnancy. Ruby takes Chad to New York where he plays trumpet and makes a name for himself. Catherine leaves school and moves in with Tony and Salome, creating tension between the young couple.
