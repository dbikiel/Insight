This epic movie follows young shepherd David taking on the mighty warrior Goliath against all odds. Filmed in North Africa and London.
Young David, a.k.a. Shepherd Boy, has more faith in God than anyone else among his people. If no one in Saul's army will take on Goliath - the champion man-slayer among Leader Jaggar's Philistines - he will. David's soldier brothers, Eliab and Abinadab, have no encouragement for their underage sibling's foolhardy venture and do all they can to crush it; but, with no one else showing a gram of moxie to stand against the taunting giant, Saul finally permits the confrontation and prepares for the young lad's certain death - a determined boy who stubbornly approaches the giant without sword, spear or protective leather vest.
