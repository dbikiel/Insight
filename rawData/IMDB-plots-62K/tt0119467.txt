After a robbery scam that goes bad, lovers Nikki and Al take off into the Australian outback, pursued by the police and a malevolent footballer named Zipper Doyle, and meet a number of offbeat characters.
Two young scam artists rob their drugged victims after the woman is picked up in bars and taken to a hotel room. The only problem is that their latest victim dies. Looking at his stuff, they suddenly find a video tape with a former athlete sexually involved with a young boy. The woman contacts the athlete and sets off a series of murders in which they are incriminated and a chase across Australia led by the athlete, the police, and an aborigine tracker.
