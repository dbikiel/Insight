The true story of a working class boy who moves to the nation's financial capital at a young age and becomes one the most influential politician in Brazil's history.
In 1945, in Garanhuns, in the countryside of Pernambuco, Luiz Inácio da Silva is born, the seventh child of Aristides and Dona Lindu. Aristides moves to Santos and Lindu raises the siblings alone until 1952 when the family moves to Santos to meet the patriarch. As time goes on, the poor family struggles to survive with the children studying at elementary school and working as street vendors. Later Lindu leaves the alcoholic and abusive Aristides and moves with her children to São Paulo. Lula graduates as lathe operator and gets a formal job in the industry where he purposely cuts his own finger in a press, to get retirement by disability.
The story of a man who have never worked in his entire life, purposely cuts his finger off to receive disability retirement. This man took advantage of the hope of working people to destroy the education, health and economy of the whole nation. The brainwashing caused by the Brazilian political mafia is of such a high degree that it is easy to find people in defense of these white-collar criminals. The film tells the story of what the Brazilian people call "the cancer of the nation". It is clear that the film was overpriced, made with public resources and against the will of the person of good. The movie should be called "The Destruction Of The Brazil".
