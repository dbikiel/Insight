Linda Lawrence rises from secretary to account executive in an advertising agency. She falls in love with ex-football star Jimmy Hall and marries him. Radio man Harry Galleon will push her career further if she will just be "nice" to him and, when Jimmy gets jealous, she quits in favor of life as a suburban housewife. But her career still calls to her.
Twenty-two year old Linda Lawrence works for Americo, a New York advertising agency. Her current job is as assistant to one of the executives, the elderly Mr. Bates. She is determined through hard work and advertising ingenuity to become a successful advertising executive. As such, she has no time for romance, especially in dealing with the advances of Jimmy Hall, who she finds somewhat amusing when she thinks about it, which isn't often unless trying to stop him from pursuing her. Jimmy, in general, is more interested in getting the girl than he is in work. As Jimmy tries to get Linda, he not only has to battle the priority of her career, but others in Americo who are also interested in her romantically, most specifically Harry Galleon, an executive heading the account on which she is working and thus someone who can help advance her career. Bea Harris, the only female executive at Americo, tries to help Linda both professionally and personally.
