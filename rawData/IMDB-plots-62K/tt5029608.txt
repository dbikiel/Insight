In the aftermath of WWI, a young German who grieves the death of her fiancé in France meets a mysterious Frenchman who visits the fiancé's grave to lay flowers.
In 1919 Quedlinburg, Germany, a young woman named Anna is still mourning the death of her fiance, Frantz Hoffmeister, in the Great War while living with his equally devastated parents. One day, a mysterious Frenchman, Adrien Rivoire, comes to town both to pay his respects to Frantz's grave and to contact that soldier's parents. Although it is difficult for both sides with the bitterness of Germany's defeat, Adrian explains that he knew Frantz and gradually he wins Anna and the Hoffmeisters' hearts as he tries to connect with them. Unfortunately, Adrien and Anna discover the truth of his motives and things seem shattered for all. However, when Adrien leaves, Anna has her own struggles with the truth and her feelings until she sets out to find Adrien in France. With that, Anna has her own journey to make in more than one sense, even as they both realize that neither have easy answers to their complex personal conflicts with each other and the dead man linking them.
Holed up in a silent house in post-Great War Quedlinburg with the grieving parents of her dead fiancé, Frantz, the bereft young German woman, Anna, still finds it impossible to cope with her heavy loss, one hard year after his death in the front-line trenches. To further complicate matters, the mysterious arrival of the deceased's fragile French companion, Adrien, will pave the way for an onslaught of emotions and an unforeseen relationship, as the kind-hearted visitor breaks the ice with Anna and Frantz's parents. For the past week, Adrien has been placing flowers on the grave of his close friend, trying to pay his last respects, while struggling with the insufferable burden of guilt--a creepy feeling only those who have survived the horrors of war know. However, has Adrien the right to claim a place in Anna's delicate heart?
