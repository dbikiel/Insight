A poetic comedy set in a pub situated on an inlet and called At the Ferryman's, which is run by pub-keeper Tonda (Jirí Schmitzer) and his companion Andula (Lenka Vlasáková). Among the pub-goers is Kája (Miroslav Vladyka), who compensates for his tendency to gamble (thanks to which is marriage is on the rocks) by playing cards at the pub with his friends. Besides his salary as a security guard at an art gallery, he has saved a pretty penny over the years by posing as a chimney sweep for newlyweds' photos, and now he wants to use it to give his wife (Simona Babcáková) a long-promised seaside holiday, a promise which breathes new life into their relationship. But in a moment of weakness, Kája loses all of his savings playing the shell game at the marketplace. So as not to lose the rekindled love of his wife, he requests the help of his friends from the pub. Combining their forces, they eventually manage to slam the shell-game gang and recover his money. The whole experience has a profound effect on Kája, who learns a lesson from the scare, confirms his friendship with the others, and realizes just how important they are to him.
