Details the efforts of a pop-rock star (James Roberts / Rick Springfield) to win the love of a woman he meets in a car accident. None of the usual gambits work on this woman, who has never heard of him. Complications arise involving the ex-girlfriend Nicky, who is still in his band. Lots of Springfield tunes help the plot along.
Rock star Jaime Roberts (Rick Springfield) is having a bad night. While trying to avoid his crazy ex-girlfriend, he locks himself out of his dressing room wearing only a towel, gets chased by a pack of rabid fans and has a car accident going back to his SF hotel. This is how he meets uptight child psychologist Diana Lawson. Sparks fly and Jaime is smitten. Will love win out over demanding careers and crazy exes? Great soundtrack by Rick Springfield and others.
