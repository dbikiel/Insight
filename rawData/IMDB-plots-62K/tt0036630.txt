Director John Huston documents the Battle of San Pietro Infine in December 1943.
This documentary movie is about the battle of San Pietro, a small village in Italy. Over 1,100 US soldiers were killed while trying to take this location, that blocked the way for the Allied forces from the Germans.
This official War Department film directed by John Huston gives an account of the 9 month battle in the area of San Pietro, Italy during World War II. The film is blunt in its presentation of the battle, including the fact that several attempts to seize control of the location failed miserably with heavy casualties. While the overall tone of the film is positive in that it praises the men who were fighting, the War Department never used the film as it believed it would have a negative effect on morale.
