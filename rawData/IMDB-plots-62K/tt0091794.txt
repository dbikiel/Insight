Project A-ko is the typical love triangle of three school girls and their confrontations with aliens, giant robots, and women who look like burly men.
A gigantic spaceship impacts in the center of an Earth city. 16 years later, a new metropolis has been built around the spire of the embedded spaceship. Young A-Ko is trying to cope with fitting into her new school and her motor-mouth friend C-Ko. The rich, stunning B-Ko tries to ruin the "new girl" by fighting her with giant robots, super exoskeletons and a girl who looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger in pony tails. Oh, did I mention that A-Ko has superpowers? Amidst her "normal" trials, A-Ko also has to deal with an alien armada trying to track down their lost princess.
