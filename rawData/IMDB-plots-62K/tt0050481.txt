Sheriff Halliday doesn't approve of his children dating or marrying half-breeds and his blind hate threatens to alienate his whole family.
As a man returns home to see his dying father, the story of the alienation between father and son is told in flashback. Purposely letting his daughter's lover get lynched, shooting the lynched man's father when he threatens him with a gun, and the bullying tactics used by him as a Sheriff causes the son to leave. The son now plans to ruin his father and get his Sheriff's badge removed.
