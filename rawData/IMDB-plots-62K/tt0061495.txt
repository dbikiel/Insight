A womanizing art dealer and a painter find the serenity of their Riviera vacation disturbed by a third guest, a vivacious bohemian woman known for her long list of male conquests.
Adrien travels to a villa on the Riviera. He is on vacation and plans to relax. He shares the villa with a friend, Daniel, and a female stranger, Haydée. Haydée has many lovers, and both Adrien and Daniel despise her at first, but Adrien soon becomes more and more intrigued and infatuated.
The arrogant and pretentious intellectual art dealer Adrien invites his girlfriend to travel with him to the coast to spend one month vacation with his close friend and painter Daniel in the house of their Randolphe. Adrien expects to do nothing but read and rest in the house and meet a possible investor in an art gallery that he dreams on having; however she prefers to travel to London. When he arrives, he discovers that the sexy and promiscuous pleasure-seeking Haydee that had one nightstand with Randolphe is sharing the house with Daniel. Along the days, Adrien becomes obsessed in a sick game of humiliating Haydee and imaging that she is trying to seduce him; however, his lust for her increases but his moral rationalization of their possible relationship keeps them apart.
Overlooking the sun-kissed Saint-Tropez on the French Riviera, a hospitable and picturesque villa becomes the perfect retreat for two friends and refined aesthetes, the handsome antiques dealer, Adrien, and the aspiring artist, Daniel. However, their quiet and idle summer holiday by the beach is abruptly spoiled by the unexpected arrival of the fresh, sun-burnt, unreflective and rather simple but sweet nymphet, Haydée, whose inherent inclination to promiscuity will soon lead Adrien and Daniel into teaching their unsophisticated companion a thing or two about morality. But, how easily and for how long can they ignore young Haydée's gravely sinful distractions?
