Wolfgang Zenker, a middle-aged traveling ladies' fashion salesman is in dire straits: his deadly rival is threatening to steal his best customers and he's lost his driver's license. Desperate to stay one step ahead of his young enemy salesman, he cancels his son's holiday and employs him as an unwilling chauffeur. Things go from bad to worse - the bank is after him, the taxman catches up with him, his wife leaves him, his son announces he's gay and falls in love with his father's rival! Family and foe meet in an uproarious showdown where the bullets and misunderstandings fly.
At 52, traveling salesman Wolfgang Zenker (Edgar Selge) is in old school territory: he peddles the company's classic clothing line to boutiques that cater to women over 35. When Wolfi loses his drivers license in his brand-new Mercedes but can't afford to lose the season's sales because his frustrated wife (Franziska Walser) desperately wants a new bathroom, their son's vacation plans take a back seat as Karsten (Florian Bartholomäi) is forced to making sales rounds with his father instead of celebrating his high school graduation in Spain. Also making the rounds in small town southern Germany is successful and attractive sales rival Steven Brookmüller (Roman Knizka), 33. As the men's paths cross, long-hidden secrets are revealed and things come to a hilarious head.
