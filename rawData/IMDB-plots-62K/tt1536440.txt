Former high school classmates reunite by chance during a chaotic party-filled evening.
Casper, a soldier haunted by the horrors of war, and Rebecca, a whip-smart grad student with a shaky future. A decade after they graduate from high school, they reunite by chance and get to know each other over the course of an accidental tour of the little-known underbelly of Minneapolis. The evening's odyssey includes a bar fight, a house party, a punk-rock circus, a spontaneous burglary, a home Casper didn't know he had, and a cast of strange characters, unexpected allies and disappointing friends.
