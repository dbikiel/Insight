By the early 1960s, the OAS is desperate to stop de Gaulle's freeing of Algeria. A small group, mostly from the military, steal weapons and rob a bank to prepare for a raid on Tulle prison to set General Challe free and spark civil war. OAS members within the police try to help their cause. The government appoints a mission director, Paraux, to track them down; he must work with the police, led by Lelong. The head of the secret OAS operation is Clavet, a decorated general. For him, it's a cause of honor, but he cannot control all OAS activities, and terrorist acts do occur. The police put the screws on informers and close in. Is there any honor in this losing cause?
