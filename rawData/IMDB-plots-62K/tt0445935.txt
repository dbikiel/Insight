A journalist investigates a series of murders near American-owned factories on the border of Juarez and El Paso.
Lauren, an impassioned American reporter for the Chicago Sentinel heads to Juarez, a Mexican bordertown, in order to investigate a series of mysterious slayings involving young factory women from all over Mexico. As she discovers hundreds of victims, she gains the trust of local factory workers but falls into danger.
The film is based upon a true story surrounding the multiple murders of young women in Juárez, Chihuahua. Two men brutally rape a young woman, Eva Jimenez (Maya Zapata) and leave her for dead. She wakes up in and crawls out of her own grave. An American journalist, Lauren Adrian (Jennifer Lopez), is assigned to cover the story of the murders in Juárez. Lauren -- haunted by terrible memories of her own -- finds Eva, the only surviving victim and is determined to catch Eva's rapist. Then, with the help of Eva and Mexican newspaper editor Alfonso Diaz (Antonio Banderas), Lauren disguises herself as a Mexican worker to identify and trap the rapists. They catch one but the other escapes. Then, only days before Eva is to testify against the rapist, Lauren is forced to leave Juárez to try to have her story published. With Lauren gone, Eva flees to the United States but is caught by the border police and returned to Juárez. Meanwhile, newspaper editor Alfonso Diaz is the victim of a drive-by shooting and, by the time Lauren returns to Juárez, he has died. Lauren goes looking for Eva, but encounters the rapist instead, and he attacks her.
