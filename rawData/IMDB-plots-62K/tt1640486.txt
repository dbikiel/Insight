A man is released from prison after serving a long time for killing a man who tried to kill his best friend. Once out, he just wants to live a normal life, but his best friend immediately gets him into a new heap of serious troubles.
For the last thirteen years AJ (Triple H) has been behind bars, convicted of manslaughter for killing a man who intended to kill his best friend, Jack (Michael Rapaport). Now released, AJ wants nothing more than to start a small business and live a crime-free life. Unfortunately, within hours of leaving prison, his oldest and best friend, Jack (Michael Rapaport) involves AJ in an accidental shooting in which a man is killed, forcing Jack to skip town. Jack, a high-strung, low-level mobster, has taken good care of AJs family while he was in prison. When Jacks father and local mob boss Dr. Vic (Bruce Dern) comes looking for retribution, AJ is compelled to protect Jacks family. Jacks family consists of his wife, Claire (Parker Posey), who has never stopped loving her former beau AJ and her teenage daughter Pepper (Juliette Goglia). Martha, (Julie White) an agent for the Louisiana Tax Board, has been investigating Dr. Vic for smuggling counterfeit cigarettes into Louisiana and tax evasion. She is determined to bring Dr. Vic and Jack down with or without AJs help. In the end, AJ will stop at nothing to protect the woman hes always loved and the daughter he never knew he had.
