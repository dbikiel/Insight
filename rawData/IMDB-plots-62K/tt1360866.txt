A chronicle of a supermarket security guard's obsession with a late-shift janitor.
In Montevideo, Jara works the graveyard shift monitoring security cameras at a supermarket. He's about 30, solitary, quiet, and big. He watches TV, likes heavy metal, and sometimes works as a bouncer at a disco. One night he notices one of the cleaning crew, Julia; he watches her via the cameras as she works, then follows some days as she goes to an Internet caf√©, the beach, shopping, or the movies. He stays out of her sight and never talks to her. Thinking she may be hiding somewhere in the store with a male co-worker, Jarita breaks some rules and gets suspended. Then, while watching her one evening, she meets a man. What will Jara do?
