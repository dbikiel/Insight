A young Hollywood player is drawn into a remote place looking for a quick deal and instead finds a sanctuary, a community, and ultimately himself.
Description: Arrogant Hollywood talent agent, Josh Ross (David Moscow) is sent to Guatemala to find Oscar-winning actor Jack Palladin (Ben Gazzara). Having never met, the search is emotionally complicated as the long-time retired star was once married to Josh's late mother. Josh's contempt for the 'old' actor mirrors his comedic distaste for the local community whose help he desperately needs to find him. What he hopes will be a quick and lucrative deal turns into a humorous yet soul-searching journey for both.
