They are seekers, madmen and angels hell bent on riding across America on a bicycle in less than ten days. What began as the adventure of a lifetime is transformed in an instant when one of their comrades is killed in a head on collision. These voyagers thought it was their bodies that were being put to the test. But after the tragic accident, it is no longer their bodies that are at risk - it's their minds. The riders can only pray for deliverance as they pedal toward the Eastern Seaboard.
