After they realize this, they run off to a hidden island off the coast of France where they can not be bothered until Orso's hunger for danger and crime become too much for him, forcing him to return to his normal life...
Marie, a young French girl, begins dating a GI soldier when him and other soldiers take shore leave on the coast of France. They spend a considerable amount of time together. Then the soldier dumps her for some reason. Enter Orso, a danger hungry criminal. After unsuccessfully attempting to rape Marie, he instead steals her purse. In the purse are her treasured items. He returns the items. The two fall in love. They escape to a deserted island in the Bay Of Angels.
