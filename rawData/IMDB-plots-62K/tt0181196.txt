Buzz Lightyear must battle Emperor Zurg with the help of three hopefuls who insist on being his partners.
After a successful mission in which his partner, Warp Darkmatter, fell in battle, Buzz Lightyear vows never to put another partner at risk and works solo. This vow, however is challenged by Star Command who assigns young Mira Nova to be Warp's replacement over Buzz's objections. In addition, the LGMs suggest he tries a new robot for an assistant while a lowly janitor, Booster, has his dreams of joining the Space Rangers. Together, this group of disparate heroes find they must work together to save the galaxy when Emporer Zurg hatches his grandest scheme for conquest yet.
Buzz Lightyear is an ultimate space ranger hero that must fight against his arch enemy the evil Emperor Zurg, who steals the "Unimind," a device that enables three-eyed aliens to function as a single intellect. The aliens, referred to as "LGMs" the little green men, form the support crew that keep Star Command running, but as individual thinkers, they're inept. Buzz acquires the sidekicks who form Team Lightyear: Booster, an oversize, overeager alien; XR short for "Experimental Ranger", one of the aliens' less successful robot inventions; and the inevitable spunky girl, Princess Mira Nova of the planet Tangeah. Together, this group of disparate heroes find they must work together to save the galaxy when Emporer Zurg hatches his grandest scheme for conquest yet and take on Emperor Zurg in intergalactic combat.
