Two strangers share a sweepstakes ticket and then embark on an "imaginary" honeymoon with their "winnings".
As David Grant passes neighbor Jean Newton on the street in Greenwich Village, he impulsively wishes her good luck. Although she doesn't know him, she intuitively asks him to become her partner in an Irish Sweepstakes ticket. David agrees on the condition that she go on a world tour with him if they win the $150,000 prize as an "experiment." She reluctantly agrees over the initial objections of her oafish fianc√© Fred, who agrees to hold the ticket. When it turns out that they have drawn a horse in the race, Fred urges them to sell the ticket for the $12,000 asking price, but they turn him down. Although their horse loses, Jean is furious to learn that Fred had sold her half of the ticket. Even though David doesn't know about it, she feels obligated to share the $6000 with him. After he buys her a car with her half, she agrees to a scaled-down version of their tour to Niagara Falls, where they register as brother and sister. What Jean doesn't know is that David is actually a famous painter living under an assumed name after serving three years in prison.
