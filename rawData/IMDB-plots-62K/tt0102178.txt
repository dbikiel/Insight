A U.S. climbing team, funded by millionaire Clairborne is determined to conquer K2.
Taylor and Harold are good friends and avid climbers. While climbing one day, they meet a man who it seems might be attempting to climb K2, the world's second-highest peak. Always pushy, Taylor bugs the man for a spot on the team, claiming that he and Harold are good enough. They may be very good, but K2 is a very tough mountain.
The attorney Taylor Brooks and the professor and family man Harold "H" Jameson are best friends and climbers. Harold is married with Cindy and they have a baby son, and Taylor is a selfish womanizer. One day, they save the life of the famous climber Phillip Claiborne and most of his team after an avalanche during a climbing. On the funeral of the two climbers that had died, Taylor asks Claiborne to take Harold and him to complete his team on his next expedition, when Claiborne expects to climb the K2, the second highest mountain on Earth. Soon they travel to Pakistan and they have trouble first when the porters unexpectedly decide to return and then when Claiborne becomes sick with altitude sickness. Claiborne calls off the climb, but Taylor and Harold are decided to reach the top of the world at any cost.
