Her ten year old brother is traumatized and mute from witnessing a disturbing incident years earlier (the death of his father) involving the town's Mayor. As the girl transitions into womanhood a harsh brutality destroys her innocence when savage hunters led by the Mayor's son attack and rape her. A social worker from a distant city arrives to investigate but ultimately it is the siblings who must come of age to protect each other and survive.
Somewhere in the rugged Austrian mountains, on a small Alpine farm, two siblings, an independent 16-year-old girl and her 10-year-old brother, after witnessing their father's brutal murder and their mother's death shortly after, they struggle to carry on as usual, in secret. However, under those circumstances, it won't be long until the Mayor's son and his gang of hunters find out, seizing the opportunity to sexually assault the helpless teenage girl. Eventually, the attackers will come back for the girl's life, but this time, the unprotected siblings will have no other choice but to make their desperate last stand against the ruthless assailants. Now, it's either death or survival.
