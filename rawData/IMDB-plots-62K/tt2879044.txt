One man always on the move will have an encounter that puts into question everything he knows.
One man that have a meaningless live because day by day he's teleported to another place around the world and he need to adapt his life to survive for a day. But, in a moment, he's teleported to a city. There is where he's go to a coffee shop and met a girl and her son. They talk while afternoon and when his alarm clock rings, he need to fire out and leave the family that he has loved. Sad and angry to need to leave to another place, he lies down. When he wake up, realize that he's on the same place and the story ends. The meaning about that story is: he's where his heart want to stay
