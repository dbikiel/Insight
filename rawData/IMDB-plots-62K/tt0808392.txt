The story of what happened to Neal Cassady after Jack Kerouac's "On The Road" came out. Deals primarily with Neal's relationship to his fictional alter-ego, Dean Moriarty.
A look at Neal Cassady, who was an icon of the Beat Generation of the 1950s and the psychedelic movement of the 1960s, perhaps best known as the inspiration for the character of Dean Moriarty in Jack Kerouac's classic On the Road.
Chronicled by greats like Allen Ginsberg, Neal Cassady became an antihero for a new age. But, it was as Dean Moriarty, the lead character in Jack Kerouac's historic On the Road, that he was immortalized. Later in life Cassady hopes to settle into an ordinary family life and write his own book, but the pressure from Beat fans to act like Moriarty haunts him. Unable to write his own story, Cassady finds himself drawn back into the role of muse(this time driving the bus for Ken Kesey.)
