A cynical workaholic gets suspicious of her banker father's sudden departure from his career and city life to move to a small town with unusually strong ties to Christmas.
A week before Christmas, Liz McCann (and her young son Mason) visit her estranged father, who strangely lives in a town decked out for the holidays and full of Christmas spirit. Strange events immediately occur when they arrive, challenging everything Liz had once believed in.
Southern California realtor and single mother Liz McCann is a workaholic, much like her banker father Jack Travers. Her work leaves her little time to spend with her nine-year-old son, Mason, even during the Christmas holidays, much to Mason's dismay. Liz sees Christmas as a nuisance with which to deal, except for being able to use the holiday spirit of others to her business advantage. Despite Liz's feelings about Christmas, Mason is able to talk her into visiting Jack for Christmas, who has just moved to a little town called Hollyville, which isn't located on any map. Upon their arrival in Hollyville, Mason immediately becomes enthralled with life in the town, especially at the mysterious N.P. Enterprises, and the Christmas spirit pervasive there, which he believes is more than just Christmas spirit. Liz, surprised to see Jack living a more relaxed lifestyle, just wants to continue on with her work via cell phone, but Jack, Mason, and local caf√© owner Kevin O'Reilly, who, like Jack, just found Hollyville when his life wasn't going all that well, try to convince Liz that she needs to believe to make her life more meaningful.
