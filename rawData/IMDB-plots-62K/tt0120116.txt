Goofy middle-aged Ah Gu is not happy with his money-obsessed bride Lily, who only wants to go out and have fun. At the same house, young Meng is left to look after his siblings, sister Trixie and baby brother Tee. He acts like an old man, trying to teach them discipline, and subsequently has problems with Trixie's boyfriend.
In a high-rise, a young man jumps to his death. His ghost remains in the building, observing and consoling three households. San San, fat, silent, and alone, hears the ghost of her mother constantly upbraid her. She futilely seeks the friendship of a wealthy woman with whom she was raised. Ah Gu, a tofu soup vendor, is at odds with Lily, his materialistic wife, a Chinese immigrant who longs for something he cannot provide. Meng spouts every moralistic bromide of the striving middle class, wears a T-shirt reading "My block is the cleanest," and is unhinged by his teenage sister May ("Trixie" to her boyfriend) who won't study, parties all night, and seems doomed by youth culture.
