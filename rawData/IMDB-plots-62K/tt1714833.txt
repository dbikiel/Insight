In the 70s two brothers battle killer waves, conservative society and ruthless bikers to kick-start the modern surf industry.
In the early 1960s the broke and fatherless Fisher family drift across the southern coast of Australia looking for a place they can call home. Jimmy nearly drowns in an accident and becomes withdrawn from the traumatic experience. Elder brother Andy fights to protect Jimmy from tough local kids while their mother, Anna, fights to put food on the table. Andy and Jimmy are inspired by a local surf photographer, JB to create their own surf gear.
After struggling to gain acceptance by the local surf community, the two brothers then struggle to realize their dream: building a lifestyle and business out of the sport they love.
