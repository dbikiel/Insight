Christ takes on the form of a pacifist count to end a senseless war.
Allegorical film about peace. A king starts a war, many of the women are against it, people are pressed into service. A count has constructed a submarine and gets the order to sink an ocean liner, that is also carrying - supposedly - ammunition for the enemy. The count refuses to fire the torpedos, and sinks the submarine. He survives, but in a limbo between death and life where he meets Jesus, who takes him over to preach peace. Naturally the king arrests him and sentences him to death for treason, but then Jesus shows him the real face of war.
A submarine commander who is a secret pacifist refuses to torpedo a defense- less passenger ship, and his submarine is sunk and the captain is drowned. In the spirit world, Christ blesses the captain and returns to earth in the captain's body. There He escorts the warrior king on a tour of the horrors of war, leading to the end of war.
