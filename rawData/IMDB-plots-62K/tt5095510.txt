Stick Man lives in the family tree with his Stick Lady Love and their stick children three, and he's heading on an epic adventure across the seasons. Will he get back to his family in time for Christmas?
Stick Man, an animated twig, lives with his Stick Lady Love and their children in the family tree. Out one day for a jog he meets a little boy who throws him for his dog to fetch, some children who play Pooh-sticks with him and a swan who uses him to build a nest before being washed out to sea and onto a beach far from home. After several other humiliating encounters throughout the year he has an unexpected saviour in the form of Santa Claus who helps him to get home for Christmas with his family.
