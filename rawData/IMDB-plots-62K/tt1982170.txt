A psychiatrist is compelled by his patient, an obsessive mathematician, to consider the existence of a secret integer between three and four.
Dr Tomlin is a psychiatrist. One of his patients is a former professor (Prof. Ersheim) who is convinced that there is another whole number which is meant to exist between 3 and 4. While Ersheim is sectioned and struggling to work out this number, Tomlin experiences some strange things and a memory from his youth of a car crash is triggered.
