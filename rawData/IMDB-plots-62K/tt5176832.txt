When Chris and Andy order a model from an escort service, they find that something is unnaturally wrong with Natasha, something deadly wrong.
Eddie (Anthony Del Negro) and his friend Chris (Christopher Lenk) call out for an escort after Eddie's girlfriend (Isabella Racco) breaks up with him and moves out of their house. Little do they know that while Natasha is a breathtaking beauty, she's really a possessed doll created by a mad doctor (Don Scribner) in an unholy laboratory and built with the urge to kill and dominate the minds of others to kill for her.
