Paralyzing, tormenting and overwhelming. Often laughed off as nothing more than an affliction of adolescence, love sickness becomes the topic of a sensitive and compelling documentary film. Christian Frei and cinematographer Peter Indergand dive into the frenzied nights of the newly rejected. Nights full of pain and tears, yet also wakefulness and creativity. An anthropologist researches the astounding and profound processes that are unfolding in the brain of the lovesick. Has nature overdone it? The film explores the difficult path out of self-destructive obsessive behavior, toward a new self. And it wonders about the unwavering desire - despite it all - for love.
