Can a young person in the South Bronx pursue a dream that isn't tied to crime, gang-banging, prostitution, violence, and racism? Tommy is a natural leader and a gifted artist. When Allen, a white kid, moves into the neighborhood with his single mom, he's a victim of constant harassment until Tommy offers friendship. Meanwhile, a corrupt cop hits on Allen's mother and, when she rebuffs him, vows revenge. Forces beyond Tommy and Allen's control put them in the hands of the criminal justice system. A local murder, a rivalry between two young women, and the hot temper of Tommy's older brother make things even more difficult for the friendship and dreams of the young men.
