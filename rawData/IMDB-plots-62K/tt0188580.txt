The first ever animated version of the popular Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale "Thumbelina".
There was one woman in the world and she had no children. She decided to go to the witch. The witch was kind and gave the woman a barley kernel, from which a beautiful flower grew in a pot. When the bud opened, there was a small-small girl no more than an inch in height. Therefore, she was called Thumbelina. Thumbelina was very friendly and sweet. She lived on the dresser of her foster mother and slept in a cot of nutshells. Once, the Swamp Toad noticed her and decided that Thumbelina could become a perfect pair for her son. At night, Toad stole the sleeping Thumbelina and brought her to her son.
