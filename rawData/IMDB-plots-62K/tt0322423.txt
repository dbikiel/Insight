Marcin and Kaska are young lovers in a lousy little town in Poland. Marcin has just lost his father and is sadly preparing to take over the small auto mechanic business and the house. But Kaska has an opportunity to go study in the U.S. and is planning to leave. Marcin is devastated, but his loony relatives arrive for the funeral and things go into flux. The post-funeral banquet makes for a crazy and emotional climax to the story.
