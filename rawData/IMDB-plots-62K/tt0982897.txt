Lena, 17, is restless and desperate. In a few weeks she will finish school, but she doesn't have any definite plans for her future. She wants to make music, that's the only thing she knows. Will she be able to resist the pressure that comes from the people around her - parents, teachers, and society? Will she make her way?
