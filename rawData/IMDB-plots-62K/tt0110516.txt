A group of young boys befriend a prostitute named, V.
Young Frank and his pals get an idea for the ultimate in excitement. They decide to pool their savings, bicycle to the nearby Big City, and hire some woman of the streets to strip for them. Things do not work out that simply, but they do meet V, a Hooker With A Heart Of Gold, who ends up giving them a ride home. Soon she is living in Frank's treehouse, unbeknownst to Frank's widowed father Tom, who thinks she is one of Frank's teachers. Soon, however, the evil Waltzer comes looking for V.
Twelve-year-old Frank becomes friends with V, a sweet young woman, despite the fact that they live in very different worlds. She has been working as a prostitute and he is the son of a regular guy living in a nice suburban home. Frank offers her his tree house to stay for a while without his father's knowledge, but danger enters the picture when V's "manager" tracks her down. Can she be close to Tom and Frank now that her cover is blown?
With the intention of finally seeing the naked body of a real woman, three 12-year-old best friends who pooled their milk money, Frank, Brad and Kevin leave the quiet suburb of Middletown to bicycle to the nearest big city, anxious to see a willing woman take off her clothes. As a result, it is not before long when V, a prostitute with a heart of gold, agrees, however, when her car breaks down while driving the friends home, V will soon realise that maybe the inconspicuous suburban town is the perfect hideout. But as V becomes indispensable in the lives of Frank and his widower father, Tom, inevitably, the past will abruptly catch up with her, putting in jeopardy young Frank's secret plan. Can now V get a second chance at love in the small community?
