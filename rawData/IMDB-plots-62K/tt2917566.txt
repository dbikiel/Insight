A drama with supernatural influences, The Other One follows a young woman named Amber who has returned to her childhood home, caring for her mother now in the throes of dementia and haunted by the death of her young son who drowned mysteriously 30 years prior. Watching her mother slip further away, Amber struggles with her own ghosts as she feels her life crumbling around her. All of the characters in The Other One are haunted in the way that each of us is -- by the pasts that we embrace, we hide from, we lie about, and that we make peace with.
A woman survives a school shooting and returns to her hometown to care for her ill mother, only to learn her entire life is a lie.
