An embittered, vengeful POW stalks his former commanding officer who betrayed his men's planned escape attempt from a Nazi prison camp.
War veteran Frank Enley seems to be a happily married small-town citizen until he realises Joe Parkson is in town. It seems Parkson is out for revenge because of something that happened in a German POW camp, and when a frightened Enley suddenly leaves for a convention in L.A., Parkson is close behind.
Joe Parkson is a disabled war veteran who is out for revenge. The target of his wrath is his former commanding officer, Frank Enley, who he blames for what happened to him. They flew 25 missions together and were shot down, ending up in a German POW camp. As the senior officer in their hut, Enley tried to dissuade the men from trying to escape. They were all starving however and Parkson and the rest of the crew felt they had no choice. Enley made a pact with the devil however and has been haunted with his choices ever since. None of that dissuades Parkson who follows Enley after he goes on the run to Los Angeles. Once there, a distraught and drunken Enley makes yet another deal that he is unable to live with.
