A space fantasy about an explorer who pays a visit to an unusual cathedral built with organic materials.
The shadowy figure of a solitary pilgrim drifts away within the dark halls of a Gothic cathedral. Impossible to ignore the magnificent organic structure which perches atop an infinite abyss, the silent wanderer is dwarfed by the ancestors' colossal statues. Is this the eternal shrine of the glorious warriors?
Is religion the opiate of the people, or something darker? A pilgrim happens on an unfinished cathedral, with Gothic vaults and Gaudiesque echoes, poised on the edge of a cliff. As he walks through, statuary appears, and these figures hold the key to the essence of religion. Do insight and discovery await the pilgrim?
