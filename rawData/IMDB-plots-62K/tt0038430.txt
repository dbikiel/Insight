The Crime Doctor comes up against a criminal with a dual personality.
In the 6th entry of Columbia's "Crime Doctor" series, Dr. Robert Ordway (Warner Baxter) is consulted by an ex-serviceman who tells him he suffers from temporary loss of memory spells and during these periods finds himself in an unfamiliar part of the city. Ordway visits the area late one night and finds his patient murdered. He meet the man's fianc√©e, Irene Cotter (Ellen Drew), who has a problem of her own. She has a sister Natalie ('Ellen Drew')) who has completely dominated her life but she hasn't seen her for three years.
