When all the children in a small town become possessed, one mother refuses to believe that her daughter is lost to the devil and will do whatever it takes to keep her alive.
When Anna's daughter Joey goes missing, it's assumed to be the result of bad parenting - but dark forces are suspected when every child in town also disappears. The children return but show signs of demonic possession, and proceed to attack the town. Forced to wage a violent campaign against the children, the townspeople go on a bloody rampage, but Anna refuses to believe her daughter is lost to the devil and will do whatever it takes to save her from the demon inside.
