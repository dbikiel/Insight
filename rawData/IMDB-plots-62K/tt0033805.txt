Lieutenant Bill Mason pursues a Chicago gang to New York unaware that its scar-cheeked leader Slade is a woman.
A Chicago gang led by scar-cheeked Slade carries out an audacious brokerage robbery. Lieut. Bill Mason takes the case, continuing his friendly-enemy relationship with crime reporter Ann Rogers. One gang member is caught; eventually, others follow. But Mason hasn't a clue to Slade, principally because he's unaware she's a woman. The plot periodically pauses for comic and romantic interludes.
