An abused wife's plan to escape her husband goes awry when she accidentally kills him, causing her to split on a cross-country drive with her best friend and his corpse in tow.
Anora (Laura Harrington) is a pretty, but totally down-played, low, middle-class housewife, with two sullen kids, and a racist, abusive, jackass of a husband. She escapes all this by being vacant throughout most of her day and day dreams about looking lovely and having her fantasy man visit her. Surprisingly, her fantasy man looks like her husband, Cheb (Oded Fehr) only he's cleaned up and romantic.New neighbor, African-American, Kathy K cosmetics sale person, Imogene (Jill Marie Jones from Girlfriends) tries to befriend Anora, who is hesitant because of her husband's prejudice and temper.At the same time the other protagonist and narrator of the film, is Anora's daughter, Tabby (Ashley Duggan Smith) a completely angst ridden 15 year old, who doodles her real feeling on notepaper. One great narration: "Belting your best friend for sucking off your boyfriend, really makes you feel like a f 'in Rock Star!"The son, Little Pete (Christopher Newhouse) has homosexual tendencies and begins carrying around an ugly, cheap, dollar store looking doll, he names Misty.Once Cheb finds Anora and Imogene together kissing and Anora shoots him dead, the jocularity really takes off!
