On New Year's Eve, two lost in the woods toys try to prove to wild and hungry predators that they're not good to eat.
On the eve of the New Year, Father Frost and his chauffeur, Snowman, are leaving the fairy-tale tower in Moscow for a New Year tree holiday in kindergarten, capturing, as expected, a bag of gifts. Other toys include a teddy bear and a cotton bunny, designed for the girl Lusya and her brother, Vanya. But on the way, both gifts inadvertently fall out through the hole in the bag and remain in the forest. They will have to go through many adventures, before they finally get to their little masters.
