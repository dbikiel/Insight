Based on the same name novel it tells a story of two popular college students who fell in love through an online game.
Bei Weiwei is a beautiful and intelligent computer science major who plays an ultra-high-level character in an online game. When her game "husband" divorces her character, she unexpectedly meets the #1 game avatar, Yixiao Naihe, who immediately asks her to marry him to accomplish game goals. But where does one draw the line between a fantasy game and real life-- especially when the game relationship becomes more important to both players than they expected?
