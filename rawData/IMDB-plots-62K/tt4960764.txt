A few years from now, something will happen that will change our world. A global event that causes pandemonium, chaos, and death. Life as we know it will never be the same. Left behind are abandoned buildings, empty streets, and other painful reminders of a better yesterday. Not a single adult remains, all victims of this global catastrophe. The only survivors are teenagers and children, living on the streets in the hollowed out shell of a once great city. This is their world now. They make their own rules and enforce their own laws. Some are merely trying to survive, while others rule by force.
In the aftermath of an unknown catastrophe, a community left with zero living adults has descended into a modern-day Lord of the Flies, run by a small cabal of what had been the jocks occupying the athletic and social upper crust of the local high school, headed by Caleb (Patrick Schwarzenegger, SCOUTS GUIDE TO THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE). Faced with the bleak despair of their situation, Josh (Jacob Lofland, MUD) and Jessie (Sophie Kennedy Clark, PHILOMENA) strike out on a dangerous journey into the unknown to find family and hope for the future, with Caleb and his vicious underling Gentry (James Bloor, LEATHERFACE) in hot pursuit.
