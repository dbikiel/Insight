A Bronx town is terrorized by a crack addicted raccoon.
The Bronx is facing a new problem. The overdevelopment of our waterfronts has forced animals such as raccoons, skunks and possums to invade neighborhoods like Locust Point in search of food and shelter which has been denied by the raising of these structures. Unknown to anyone, a crack addicted raccoon with a craving for blood enters the town of Locust Point, adding a new dimension to the problem. Along the way we are introduced to a cast of characters out of a demented Norman Rockwell painting, people you have a hard time warming up to, the real monsters in this story.As the story progresses, a plot to buy Locust Point and turn the property into a giant condo complex is revealed and it seems some local politicians are working hand in hand with the local construction king, BENNY BALZONE to achieve this goal. Dirty politics, Drug and Child abuse and one murderous cracked out raccoon set the stage for the most exciting horror film to come out in years.And remember, NOT ALL CRACKHEADS HAVE TWO LEGS(From KRACKOON.COM)
