A lonely socialite and a young drifter enter into a May-December romance.
One year after "Saturday Night Fever," John Travolta starred in this love story between a young drifter and an older woman - Lily Tomlin. The characters are savagely portrayed, and the story is set against a backdrop of shrink-riddled and over-privileged society.
John Travolta plays Strip Sunset, the ultimate female man-toy! If you are a fan of sexy fun on the beach, May-December romance, foot worship, muddy dogs, and awkward, boner-killing PG-13 psuedo-sex scenes, look no further. This is the brownest film ever made. This is the 70's, with a large side of 70's. Contemplating suicide? Do it. Contemplating John Travolta's sexuality? I'M NOT. He got 2 (count em, TWO) HJ's from Lily Tomlin. HE'S STRAIGHT AS FUCK DOG. Go kill yourself. But watch MbM first!
