His secret role model for the leading character is his good friend Isabel, a cheeky young woman who is waging war on genetically modified seeds around the world. And she is leaving tomorrow to go to the middle of Africa for the next three years. Low and behold, Martin confesses his love to her at the departure desk. A confession which would have meant the world to Isabel some time ago, but now comes too late to change things. But then the flight is delayed for several hours. Isabel takes off into the city to talk to Martin, but he has disappeared...
