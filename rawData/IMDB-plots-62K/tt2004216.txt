Three women kidnap their exes and hold them hostage until they get the answers they think they need in order for their hearts to be free.
Surprising, entertaining, darkly funny at times, and consistently engaging, throughout, this script begins with a sharply creative premise, and proceeds to build upon it a story that keeps the twists, turns, and unexpected revelations coming until it reaches its final scenes. Benefiting from what seems a feasible high concept, a certain sense of narrative fearlessness in its overall development, and a fairly refined sense of cinematic timing on a number of levels, it seems, already, as though this project manifests a thoroughly entertaining overall impact.Right off the bat, this script deserves credit for attacking a premise that feels fresh, unique, and surprising in its execution. The sudden abduction of three adults by three other adults as a means of attacking relationship problems is not only creative but also thoroughly engaging. The ways in which the drama within the respective couples relationships unfolds feel, similarly, rife with the potential to supply solid and at times quite comedic situational conflict. --ScriptShark.com
