Ignoring an ancient prophecy, evil brother Gregor seeks to maintain his feudal power on his his Tyrolean estate by murdering and impersonating his benevolent younger twin.
Prophecy has it that younger twin Anton will kill brother Gregor in the castle's Black Room. Anton returns to the castle after a 10 year hiatus. Gregor, a Baron, has many attempts on his life as his subjects detest his tyranny. However, good natured Anton earns the subjects' respect, and the admiration of Col.Hassel, uncle of the beautiful Thea. When Gregor kills young servant Mashka, his subjects storm the castle to remove him. Devious Gregor renounces his title in favour of brother Anton to appease them. He then kills Anton to assume his identity and the Baronship again. He is free to pursue Thea with Col.Hassel's blessing. When Col.Hassel discovers Gregor's impersonation, he also meets death. With Thea's true love, Lt. Lussan, wrongfully convicted of Hassel's murder, it appears nothing can stop evil Gregor from ambushing her into marriage. But what of that prophecy?
When Baron Frederick de Berghman learns that his wife has given birth to twin boys, he refuses to drink a toast to them. He tells his courtiers that there is a prophecy that the younger of the twins - in this case born one minute after the elder - will kill his older brother in the Black Room. As a protective measure, he seals off the room in the hope that the prophecy may not happen. Many years later, Baron Gregor de Berghman pleads with his twin brother Anton to return to the family castle. Anton arrives to find the populace in revolt and there is even an attempt on his life when they mistake him for the Baron. There is no doubt that the Baron is evil and eventually kills Anton in the Black Room and takes his identity. That does no mean the prophecy cannot, or will not, come true.
