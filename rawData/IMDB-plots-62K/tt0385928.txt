Ram (Kamal Haasan) is a playboy pilot. His marriage to Mythili (Simran) disintegrates after a series of misunderstandings. To cheer him up, his buddies arrange for a steamy evening with a prostitute Maggie (Ramya), but things go wrong and the men are stuck with a dead body and a load of diamonds. The corpse disappears, and Ram's efforts to cover up the event are thwarted by a pesky father-in-law of one of the friends (Nagesh) who thinks Maggie was Ram's wife.
