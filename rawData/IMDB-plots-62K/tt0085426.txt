In a post-apocalyptic future where no one is able to speak, the few remaining humans fight over resources in order to survive.
In the post-apocalyptic future, only a few humans are left. No one is able to speak; the film contains no dialogue, and characters communicate non-verbally. A determined loner befriends a reclusive older man and these two battle against vicious thugs for food, shelter and life itself.
In the wake of a devastating nuclear Armageddon, a solitary survivor struggles to eke out an existence, scavenging for food and water in the carcass of a scorched and desolate Earth. Under those circumstances, those few who were doomed to live, find themselves trapped in a silent nightmare, knowing that, sooner or later, they will either have to kill or be killed. The Man knows that this is hell on Earth, and he understands that there can be no allies in this inhospitable realm. Here, there is only one truth: one man's death is another man's life.
