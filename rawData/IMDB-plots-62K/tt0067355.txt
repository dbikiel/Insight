A lazy, unorthodox gunfighter and his portly, horse-thieving brother defend a Mormon settlement from a land-grabbing Major, a Mexican bandit, and their henchmen.
A drifter comes to town where his brother is sheriff. His brother is actually a robber who broke the real sheriff's leg and left him for dead, and became sheriff in order to hide out. They team up against the local land baron who is trying to get rid of the Mormon settlers in a valley he wishes to own.
Much to his surprise, Trinity, the smiling, slothful, good-for-nothing gunslinger with the lightning-fast right hand, accidentally finds out that his always grouchy hulking brother, Bambino, is now the local Sheriff of a small town. Once a horse thief, always a horse thief, and Bambino who poses as a man of the law intends on stealing the evil Major Harriman's unbranded horses, who, on the other hand, has set his eyes on a piece of land where a community of peaceful Mormons try to settle in. Before long, the brothers will decide to defend the band of pacifists, but to do so, the Mormons themselves also need to lend a hand in their salvation. Are they up to the job?
