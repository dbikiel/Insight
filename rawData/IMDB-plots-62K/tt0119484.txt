A barbarian warrior becomes a king when he defeats a king in armed combat and the king's heir conspire to overthrow him and reclaim the throne by resurrecting an evil sorceress.
A barbarian named Kull unexpectedly becomes a king after an old king (whom Kull has just killed in a battle) gives his crown to him. But direct heirs of a killed king, trying to topple Kull and regain the throne, bring an old witch-queen Akivasha back to life. Their plan backfires, however, as Akivasha is going to allow their lords - demons - to rule the kingdom. The only thing that can stop her now is a breath of the god Volka.
In the kingdom of Valusia, Kull is a barbarian who heirs the crown of the kingdom from the previous king. But General Talibaro and Prince Ducalon want to be king and accept the offer of wizard Enaros for resurrecting evil Akivasha to defeat Kull, not realizing the consequences of their deal.
