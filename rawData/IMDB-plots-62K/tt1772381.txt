The history of World War I as depicted with archival and modern aerial footage.
Fergal Keane exhibits a film of the battlefields of World War I taken from an air-ship flown by the French military shortly after the end of the war. Keane later recreates the journey of the airship along the same path to see the modern remains of the western front. He also visits other World War I sites and talks to historians about the conflict.
