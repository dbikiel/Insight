A British writer pursues a young actress to Hollywood and needs all the help he can get to win her love.
An "aspiring Hollywood actress" (Vinessa Shaw), on a visit to a charming North England town, has a brief fling with the town undertaker (David Tennant), who also writes obituaries for the local paper. Returning home, where she works as a waitress at a Japanese restaurant, she tells everyone about the handsome "writer" she met on her trip. Unfortunately, he decides to follow her back to Hollywood, setting up the expected light romantic comedy with asides as the newcomer gains experience about the goings on in Hollywood.
