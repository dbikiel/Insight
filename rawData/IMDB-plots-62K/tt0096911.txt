Bert Rigby lives in the small English town of Langmore, where most people depend on work at the local mine, which is faring poorly. While his mates are on strike once again, he decides to try his luck in show business. His first appearance on stage goes all wrong -- but the audience loves him. Rigby starts a new career as a comedian in a traveling amateur show for $50 a night. One day he gets an offer from an ad director from Hollywood and flies to the United States, expecting a great career and leaving behind his pregnant young wife.
