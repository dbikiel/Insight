Running away from the police, Aden goes to the desert where he meets an uncivilized man who has a special link with Mother-Earth. He ends up by convincing the hermit to come along with him into another desert... the big town!
After the death of his mother, the epileptic Aden flees to the desert in order to avoid any police questioning, as they believe that he was responsible for his mother's death. It is in there that Aden meets the savage yet noble Marvel. They are like two sides of the same character. While the two men bond over their travels, Aden tries to convince him that civilization is much more desirable than the wilderness, although Marvel appears to disagree. During all of this the police continue their relentless pursuit of Aden.
When his mother dies, the police want to talk to Aden Rey, but Aden, a guilt-ridden epileptic, has left for the desert. There he comes upon Marvel, a noble savage. Aden, Marvel, and Marvel's goat become companions through travels, a wedding, an examination of Aden's role in his mother's passing, a trial, additional deaths, and various meals. There are also flashbacks to Aden's childhood and his relationship to his mother. Meanwhile, the police step up their efforts to find Aden.
