In Biblical times, a girl disguises her Jewish origins when the Persian king comes looking for a new bride among his subjects.
The young Jewish girl, Hadassah, goes on to become the Biblical Esther, the Queen of Persia, who saves the Jewish nation from annihilation at the hands of its archenemy.
One Night with the King is the story of Esther, a book in the Old Testament and King Artexerxis, a powerful Babylonian king. The movie is true to the Biblical account of a Jewish woman who, at the risk of her own life, stands up to the King and a man named Haman, who was almost successful in convincing the king to wipe out all of the Jews in the land. In the Bible, one of the best lines is spoken by Mordecai, Esther's uncle, who tries to assuage Esther's fear by saying, "Who knows, perhaps you have been chosen for such a time as this." Esther is portrayed as one who is not only fun-loving but brave and wise. Artexerxes is portrayed as a man who carefully measures his decisions and falls deeply in love with Esther. In the end, Haman, the man who had a gallows constructed from which to hang Mordecai whom he insisted was subversive, was hanged on his own gallows. John Goss and Tiffany Dupont portray Xerxes and Esther, with John Noble of "Fringe" in a supporting role. There is action and intrigue as is common with many Old Testament accounts. It was fun watching John Noble portray something other than crazy/brilliant.
