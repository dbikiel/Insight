In a white hot flash of light, and with no warning, one minute our moon is there, the next it's gone. Then, a second flash. And that's the last thing anyone on Earth can remember. 11 months later, it's not post- apocalyptic; it's apocalyptic as Earth has been sucked through a wormhole, literally ripping our planet from the inside out. With bizarre disasters and civilization collapsing, our heroes must find a way to survive and get to "safe ground" before it's too late.
One new years eve a wormhole suddenly appears sucking Earth and it's inhabitants to another solar system. Nearly a year later Colin Prite CEO of Prite Industries(a new energy company) awakes in a makeshift hospital. Confused by flashing images of possible memories he is desperate to find his wife and child, but with most of the population wiped out by conditions in the new system there is little hope for them or mankind as they head toward total oblivion.
