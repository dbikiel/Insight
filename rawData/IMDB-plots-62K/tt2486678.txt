An aspiring novelist enters into a relationship with a woman, though there's just one catch: She's married and the couple can only meet between the hours of 5 and 7 each evening.
In New York, an aspiring novelist has a cinq-a-sept affair with the beautiful wife of a French diplomat. Cultures, world views, personal ethics and dietary preferences clash as love deepens, with remarkable results. Romance, drama and comedy.
Against the backdrop of a bustling New York City, the American 24-year-old hopeful writer, Brian Bloom, first sees the alluring 33-year-old French woman, Arielle Pierpoint, across a crowded pavement. Impossible to resist, the mesmerised youth summons up his courage to meet her--and much to his surprise--the two will be sharing not only laughs but also a beautiful, still, frail affair between 5 and 7 p.m. each evening. But she is married, and in her eyes, Brian is just an intriguing, yet callow young man on the path of discovering himself and his new feelings. Is there a future in this cinq-a-sept affair?
