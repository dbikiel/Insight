The former employee of a trucking company, currently in prison for embezzling the company, plans his eventual revenge against his former boss.
Nick Cherney, in prison for embezzling from Torno Freight Co., sees a chance to get back at John Torno through his young priest brother Jess. He pays fellow prisoner Rocky, who gets out a week before Nick, to murder Jess...who, dying, tells revenge-minded John that he'd written a clue "in the Bible." Frustrated, John obsessively searches for the missing Gideon Bible from Jess's hotel room. Meanwhile, Nick himself gets out with murder still in his heart. But another factor is in play that none of them (except the murdered Jess) had planned on.
Nick Cherney, a trusted employee, embezzles funds from trucking-company owner John Torno, and is sent to prison. Seeking revenge, he pays Rocky, another convict about to be released, to kill John's brother Jess, an army-chaplain priest just returned from Pacific war duty. Jess, shot in a hotel room, dies in the arms of his brother, gasping that the answer to his killing lies in the Bible. Torno, finally realizing that Jess meant the Gideon Bible which had been in his hotel room, but has disappeared, sets out to find the Bible and the killer and avenge his brother's death.
