A secluded fast food joint next to an empty parking lot, where it's good to go, because nobody recognizes you there. On a rainy autumnal day, people show up one after the other - all of them on the verge of a breakdown - or perhaps a breakthrough? The main character, Waitress, sees and absorbs it all. One by one - through their personal drama - the clients push the Waitress towards her own edge.
