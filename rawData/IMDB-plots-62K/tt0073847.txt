A priest becomes involved in demonology and exorcisms.
This movie starts with the teenager Peter (Jean-Claude Verne) who takes a picture of a mysterious naked woman (Mimma Monticelli) near a pastoral waterfall. When the picture is developed, the woman's image is gone, and Peter is possessed by her ghost through a cursed amulet he finds at the scene.
