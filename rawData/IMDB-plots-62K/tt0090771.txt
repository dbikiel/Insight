The Manhattan General Hospital has admitted a string of young women who have been raped by something otherworldly. The perpetrator only attacks women who are virgins. Dr. Pace and Detective Andriotti work together to try and isolate the strange organic material found on the victims, and to try and locate the fiend. Soon the victims begin arising in a trance and leaving the hospital by an underground passage where their fate awaits them.
