Muhad, a Muslim boy from Afghanistan, attends college in California, where he falls in love with an American journalism student, Victoria. Shortly after, his father suffers a stroke and Muhad must return home to tend to the family farm. As time passes, most of the crops are wiped out by the ongoing drought. Muhad is forced to head North with the rest of the farmers to harvest the poppies. Victoria has settled into her new life as a journalist for a local newspaper in San Francisco. When she follows a lead on a story about the ongoing war on drugs in Afghanistan, she is surprised to find her once innocent, first love is now a major player in the opium poppy trade.
