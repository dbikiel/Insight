A short about what happens under and around us. A chipmunk and a small mouse go on an adventure; they grow and learn about life and its obstacles.
From the ancient forests of North America to the legendary Sonoran desert, a diverse world of wild, mysterious and remarkable animals exists hidden in plain sight. But, the magnificent indigenous mammals are utterly unaware that beneath their hooves and paws lies a microcosm of elusive and extraordinary tiny creatures. With this in mind, this is the exciting story of an adventurous young chipmunk and a caring grasshopper-mouse mother--two minuscule beings dwelling in a world of titans. As a result, the battle for survival in such an unforgiving environment takes on a completely new meaning, especially when you are a few inches tall. In other words, a true tiny giant.
