Crime lab expert Gordon McKay uses the latest forensic techniques to solve murders in a city plagued by political corruption and mob rackets.
First feature film from director Fred Zinneman is a snappy little "B" feature that features Van Heflin as the head of a city crime lab who solves the murder of the town mayor by analyzing evidence from the crime.
Gordon McKay (Van Heflin), a police chemist and his laboratory assistant, Jane Mitchell (Marsha Hunt), are interrupted in their work on a murder case by Gerald Ladimer (Lee Bowman), McKay's old friend, who has helped elect a mayor on a reform ticket. The new mayor is murdered while investigating Ladimer and his underworld connections.
This really is a good flick for a "B" movie. It's a 1942 version of C.S.I. Check it out and see just how little has changed in almost 70 years. Horatio would fit right in.
