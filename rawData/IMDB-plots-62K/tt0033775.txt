"Frank Buck's Jungle Cavalcade" is nearly a 100% compilation film that consists of footage from three previous Frank Buck expedition films; "Bring 'em Back Alive," "Wild Cargo," and "Fang and Claw." Unlike most compilation films from major studios (and there aren't a whole lot of them to start with), RKO made no attempt to keep the viewing audience from being aware of that they were watching nearly 100% archive footage. They sniped every ad and poster with "From - "BRING 'EM BACK ALIVE" - "WILD CARGO" and "FANG AND CLAW", in addition to crediting Clyde Elliott as the director of the "Bring "em Back Alive" sequences and Armand Denis as the director of the "Wild Cargo" sequences...on all of the advertising and the film. They also used such taglines as..."3 in 1 THRILLER! Streamlining the Mightiest Scenes from ALL His Greatest Pictures..."
