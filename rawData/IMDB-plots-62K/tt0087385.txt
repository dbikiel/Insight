Three middle-aged daddies visit California to have a marvelous time at the beach. When they learn that a nice apartment and an expensive cabriolet isn't enough for them to score with the chicks, they employ a student to help them. At first he's as disgusted of them and his job as his girlfriend, but soon they find out how to use the situation to everyone's benefit.
Hunter, Rounder and Ashby are middle aged businessmen friends, who decide that they have focused on work for most of their adult lives, and now need to reward themselves by renting a nice beach house in Southern California where they plan to pick-up the nubile young women half their ages that populate the beach. They find that although they have the money, they don't have all else that goes along with impressing the girls. They meet Scotty Palmer, a young man around who the girls seems to flock. Scotty implies that they too can have all those young women if they just know how to go about it. As such, the men propose that he teach them, in return for a $600 fee and he staying with them in their nice house. What they are unaware of is that Scotty needs them as much as they need him, he who has just been evicted from his rundown pigsty of an apartment for being three months behind in rent. Scotty is able to parlay this work into managing a girl band, which the promoter wants to partner with the whole "hardbody" movement, the nickname given to the perfectly sculpted bodies on the beach. But in the process, Scotty brings out the inner monster of some of his students which threatens not only his job with them, but his relationship with his girlfriend Kristi.
This story sets out to prove that a smooth, magnetic young man can teach his amorous techniques to almost anyone, leading to successful and hilarious results. Three middle-aged men rent a beach house and hire a young stud to teach them how to score with the girls on the beach.
