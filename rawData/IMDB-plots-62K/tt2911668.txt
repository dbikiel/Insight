A high-rolling corporate shark and his impoverished young guide play the most dangerous game during a hunting trip in the Mojave Desert.
Madec, an international and unscrupulous entrepreneur, hires the skilled young tracker Ben to guide him through the fearful and barren Mojave Desert during a hunting trip. Unfortunately, however, things will take a turn for the worse, when prideful Madec shoots unintentionally the wrong target, and in a cynical attempt to wash his hands of the irrevocable deed, Madec will try to bribe himself out of this predicament by offering Ben a hefty compensation in exchange for his silence. But as this is against Ben's principles, before long, the unfortunate tracker will run for his life under the fierce and merciless sun. Undoubtedly, the desert is limitless, but on the other hand, so is the desire to survive.
