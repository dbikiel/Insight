You wake day after day to the comfort and security of your home. But how safe is it really?
Apartment concierge Cesar (Luis Tosar) is a miserable person who believes he was born without the ability to be happy. As a result, he decides his mission is to make life hell for everyone around him. A majority of the tenants are easy to agitate, but Clara (Marta Etura) proves to be harder than the most. So Cesar goes to creepy extremes to make this young woman mentally break down. Things get even more complicated in this twisted relationship when her boyfriend, Marcos (Alberto San Juan), shows up.
César is a timid and lonely concierge. He is quite good at his job, attentive and caring; he will competently take care of any problem in the building, take the dogs out for a walk--he will even wholeheartedly welcome you back home after a long day at work. However, underneath this elaborate facade, lies a well-hidden monster. Deprived of love and parental care, César has a strange relationship with his mother and a grudge against the rest of the world. As a result, from the moment his eyes are set upon his prey, César will plot and put into action his twisted machinations, just to physically and mentally destroy his unaware victim and all those who stand in his way. Now, can you spot the wolf among sheep?
