A harrowing psychological thriller from a widely acclaimed filmmaker, Daylight pits a couple lost in America against a conniving gang of kidnappers, in David Barker's rigorous and personal re-imagining of the genre film.
Three violent young men stranded in an isolated country house, carjack a Swiss couple driving to a wedding in the U.S. Husband Daniel blurts out that he'll pay millions if they don't hurt his pregnant wife, so the leader sets off for the wedding with Daniel, to arrange ransom. The other, strangely polite kidnappers stay in the house with the wife, but don't even lock her up, as Irene's pregnancy and religious faith play with their raw emotions.
