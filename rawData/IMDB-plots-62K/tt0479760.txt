A BBC adaptation of the Victorian "penny dreadful" tale of 18th century "demon barber" Sweeney Todd, of Fleet Street, who cuts the throats of unsuspecting clients in his London shop.
Winstone brings to life a very introspective Sweeney Todd, whose childhood was crushed by injustice and who has a soft heart for the downtrodden. The barber's killings are oddly understandable, and his connection with Mrs. Lovett is slowly drawn and gripping. The story is convincingly detailed with plot, motivation, jealousy, remorse, and an irresistible bloodthirst.
