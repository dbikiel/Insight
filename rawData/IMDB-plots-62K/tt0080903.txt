When a leak of information in the African Section of British Intelligence is discovered, security man Daintry is brought in to investigate.
When Arthur Davis, a junior bachelor in the British Secret Service's African section, is seen taking a file with him, to meet his girlfriend Cynthia, the brass fears he may be the leak to Moscow, and allows Dr. Percival to terminate the "risk factor" by poisoning to avoid a scandal. In fact, Davis' desk chief, Maurice Castle, is the double Agent, since the South African Communists helped him smuggle out his black lover Sarah M., meanwhile his wife and mother of schoolboy Sam, to force him to cooperate with the Apartheid government. When Cornelius Muller, the South African official who failed to get him in Pretoria's power, visits London for the anti-Communist operation Uncle Remus, he points out Castle still is the natural suspect.
Espionage drama adapted from a Graham Greene novel. The directors of the British foreign intelligence service MI6 have determined that a double agent in the organization is supplying information to the Soviets. Suspicion falls upon the southern Africa office, headed by Maurice Castle, a former field operative who is married to a black South African woman.
