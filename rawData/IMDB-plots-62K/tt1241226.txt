Skip, the nighttime janitor in an old West theme park, delves into the mysteries surrounding an old locker. His sage supervisor recounts chilling tales that underscore the importance of making the right choice. The recollection includes an aging boxer who is given an opportunity to become a real killing machine, a young man seeking membership in a secret society who experiences an initiation with deadly consequences, a would be suicide shaken to his core by a menacing member of a very special club, and a hit man for hire playing a devious cat and mouse game with three women who have a score to settle. The stories suddenly come into play when Skip makes an unsettling discovery and faces a life-or-death decision of his own.
Locker 13 is the story of Skip (Jason Spisak, Piranha), a young ex-convict who takes a position as a night janitor at an old-west theme park. His supervisor Archie (Jon Gries, Napoleon Dynamite), teaches him the ropes, but more importantly attempts to convey critical philosophical messages through a series of four stories: a down and out boxer (Ricky Schroder, NYPD Blue, Silver Spoons, The Champ) is given the opportunity to become a real golden gloves killer; an assassin (Rick Hoffman, Suits, Battleship) kidnaps three people in order to find out who hired him for his latest hit; a new recruit (Bart Johnson, High School Musical) is initiated into a lodge of fez-wearing businessmen where hazing can take a malevolent turn; and a member of a suicide club (Jason Marsden, Boy Meets World, White Squall) introduces real fear into a man about to jump to his death. The four stories suddenly come into play when Skip is faced with a life-or-death decision of his own.
