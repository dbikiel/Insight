Emanuelle hosts a Mondo film look into bizarre and perverse sexual encounters, fantasies, and rituals from around the world.
Emanuelle hosts this peculiar sexploitation Mondo film that looks at several examples of bizarre sexual behavior. Opening with a sexual mystic ceremony, it moves on to views of modern night club, including a woman trying to seduce a mule into bestiality. An unorthodox penile enlargement operation is shown, plus lesbian sex championships. Outside of the modern world, there is footage of a boar slaughtering in New Guinea interspersed with scenes of sex. Like many Mondo films, most of this footage is staged, but still provides a fascinating view into Italian exploitation cinema.
