An experimental film by Hollis Frampton documenting a man talking while a telephone rings, a tour of New York, and a goldfish.
Divided into three parts. In the first, a man is seen turning the dials of a clock/radio, before moving in fast-motion whilst the sound of a ringing telephone is heard. The second is fast-motion tour of New York, during which a voice speaking in German is heard narrating. The last is a shot of a singular goldfish in the tide by the sea, with the waves splashing around him.
