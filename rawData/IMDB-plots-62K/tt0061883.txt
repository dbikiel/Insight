Country girl Nadia moves to the city and becomes a maid in Valya's apartment. Valya, who is a member of the local District Committee, does not know that Nadia fell in love with her currently absent husband, a geologist named Maksim, when he had visited Nadia's village during a recent expedition.
The film is about a love triangle between three very different people. Nadia, a country girl, falls in love with Maksim, a roaming guitar-playing geologist, and in her search for him she ends up working for Valentina, his long-distance, bureaucrat wife. Nadia begins to work as a maid for Valya, but as they spend time together we can see flashbacks to their brief meetings with Maksim. Finally, news arrives of Maksim's return to Valya. On the day of his return Nadia cooks a meal for her housekeepers, lays the table and leaves before they arrive.
