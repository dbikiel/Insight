All three documentaries were mainly shot in the home of Ingmar Bergman. This was the first time ever that a filmmaker had access to Ingmar Bergman in his home at the small island Fårö in the Baltic Sea. 'Bergman and Cinema' starts with "Frenzy" from 1944 and ends with "Saraband" from 2003. It contains unique behind-the-scenes material from Bergman's private archive. 'Bergman and Theatre' is about some of Bergman's 125 theatrical stagings and about his delight with the TV medium, with successes as "Scenes from a Marriage". In 'Bergman and Fårö Island' he talks about the childhood that shaped him. He shows where he shot his film "Persona" and fell in love - and he lists his worst demons.
