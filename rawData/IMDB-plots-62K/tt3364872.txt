During the night in a toy shop, two teams of toys have a football game. One team respect fair play, another - not at all.
Competitions are first of all a game, a spectacular holiday, even if it is a contest between a team of soft toys and a team of wooden football players (captain Chubik Zaznayka). Rudeness, disrespect for the opponent, violation of the rules of the game during a desperate duel are bad helpers on the sports grounds. Proof of this are goal after goal against wooden football players. Deft, trained, honest always win.
