After a man suffering from schizophrenia is released from a mental institution, he attempts to get his daughter back from her adoptive family.
Clean shaven a tough film for some to take, but it contains by far the most honest and moving portrait of schizophrenia every put on the screen. Peter Greene portrays a young man who'd been instatutionalised. Now outside, he's desperately trying to find a way to both function in the world, and to search for his young daughter, who he had before being hospitalised, and had only seen as an infant. It's a hard film for some to watch, but it's also highly rewarding -especially in Mr Green's riveting performance.
