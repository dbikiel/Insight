An unmarried couple in the strict Greek society of the 60s.
When a man decides to marry the woman he's been living with, she stops being the silent patient person she was and claims to be the boss in the house. Her behaviour changes so much after the marriage that the husband gets so irritated as to ask for a divorce even a few hours later...
After ten long years, Antonis Kokovikos, an overbearing executive director, finally takes the decision of walking down the aisle with his chosen one, Eleni, a sweet, yet illiterate woman. But now, as a result of years of abuse, Mrs Kokovikou refusing to be his slave anymore, decides to make a change for the better and start caring for herself too. Of course, this abrupt change in Eleni's personality and behaviour infuriates her surprised husband, who will have no other choice but to take some really drastic measures.
Antonis Kokovikos, a director of a ministry, lived for more than 10 years with a poor and illiterate woman, Eleni. Capricious and satrapic as he was, he behaved like a slave, avoiding even knowing his friends. She caressed her tenderly, cared for, loving and obeying Antonakis. At the funeral of a friend, Antonis is forced to recommend Eleni to his friends. Their spouses immediately appreciate Eleni's qualifications. Everyone is now pushing Antonis to marry the golden girl, which is happening. Immediately after the wedding, Antonis finds that Eleni now has requirements.
