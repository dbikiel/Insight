Following a daughter, wife and mother as they lead the political party Golden Dawn through the upcoming elections.
The key male members of the far-right political party Golden Dawn are imprisoned accused of carrying out organized criminal activity. To maintain Golden Dawn's position as the fifth largest political party in Greece, their daughters, wives and mothers step up to the task of leading the party through the upcoming elections. As the elections and trial unfold, the Norwegian film crew gets access to secret chambers and witness the family dynamics of one of Europe's most notorious nationalist parties. This documentary exposes the mindset, values and personalities of the people on the front lines of modern nationalism. What happened to Greece? This is filmmaker HÃ¥vard Bustnes' impression of this disturbing documentary. In recent years, Greece - with its sunny beaches and friendly people has been overshadowed by political ideologies that are close to Nazism. In this documentary, a daughter, a wife and a mother strive to avoid any slips of the tongue during interviews and regularly pause and stop to make sure the result is agreeable. But Bustnes leaves the camera running - revealing not only the depraved side of this political party but also revealing an ever-widening gulf between facts and political image-making. While it's frustrating that the women are so inflexible in their views, it illustrates how wearing blinders can derail an entire society.
