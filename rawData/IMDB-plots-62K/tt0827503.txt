Failed magician Iskender decides to do a tour to save his career, but has to bring his grumpy and senile father along. The tour is quite unexpectedly interrupted when a bride actually disappears from the stage.
Iskender is a failure as a magician. He knows his tricks, but the audience doesn't catch on and when the 'sawing a woman in half' part of his show goes terribly wrong Iskenders employer, club owner Ayhan, is fed up with him too. Iskender and his assistant and friend 'Maradona' are devastated. Where will they get money now to finally get their eyes lasered and pay the rent? Iskender has a great idea; leave Istanbul and do a small tour in Anatolia. For that they need the caravan of his brother-in-law and that caravan is currently occupied by Iskenders father, the grumpy and seemingly senile Sait. There's no other choice than to bring him along. Luckily Sait is a good bargainer and he lands Iskender a job on a wedding in a village where they are stranded with car trouble. Reluctantly he agrees, but it isn't going as planned. How is he going to explain the actual disappearance of the bride Fatma in one of his tricks?
Iskender is a juggler. Actually he is a magician but everybody else except himself and his childhood friend Maradona, thinks he is a juggler. The two friends undertake a great deal of risk by including Sait to their tour program while they are forced to escape Istanbul. Moreover Father Sait had quit appreciating Iskender years ago. While the tour makes them come much closer, it also results in a magnificent fall-out. Iskender, Maradona and Sait, keep coming back together and falling out with their fellow traveler Fatma.
