A man decides to cook for himself, but finds the revolver of John Dillinger hidden in his kitchen instead.
Back home, Glauco, an industrial designer, finds his wife in bed with a serious headache. She has left him dinner but it is cold and Glauco decides to prepare himself a gourmet meal. While looking for some kitchenware, he discovers a revolver wrapped in a newspaper dating from 1934 announcing the death of famed mobster John Dillinger.
Glauco and Ginette lead an upper middle class life, supported by his job as an industrial designer of gas masks. However it is a rather mundane existence. What starts off as another routine working day takes a turn when he arrives home to find Ginette already in bed with a headache and his dinner prepared by their live-in housekeeper Sabine sitting cold on the dining room table. Deciding to make his own dinner instead, he rummages through their cluttered kitchen pantry to find a mysterious newspaper wrapped package. He is as captivated by the newspaper headline as he is with the package's contents: the newspaper story from 1934 being that gangster John Dillinger had been shot dead, the contents of the package being a gun. Not telling either Ginette or Sabine of his find, Glauco continues with his evening as he otherwise would have, with the exception of cleaning and playing with the gun while he does his other activities. But he slowly begins to show signs of loosening his behavior as the night progresses. By the end of the night, the events since the discovery of the gun will have a profound effect on his life.
