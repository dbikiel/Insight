Based on the novel Shojo by Kanae Minato, watch for the story of high school student Yuki who plans to see a dead body. She is more than just a little jealous of another student who has seen the corpse of a person. The morbidity has its origin in the life of young girls growing up, high school bullying, teenage rivalry and adult tyranny.
