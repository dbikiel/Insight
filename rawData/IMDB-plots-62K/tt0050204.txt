Sgt. Chuck Brennan always disliked playboy and hotshot, Col. Jim Herlihy. Now Chuck has even more reason to, Jim is dating his daughter, Lois.
U.S Air Force Sgt. Chuck Brennan always disliked playboy and hotshot, Col. Jim Herlihy. He first met him in Korea, where his emergency arrival for repairs while enroute for what Chuck thought was the colonels "hot date" in Tokyo, caused the death of several of his crewmen. Now several years later when Chuck, while still in the Air Force, is now weighing continued enlistment or retirement, the base's new C.O. is none other than Col. Herlihy. Compounding his dislike is a budding romance with Chuck's daughter, Lois.
Air Force Master Sergeant Chuck Brennan is a line chief responsible for maintaining bomber jets. He's very good at is work, perhaps the best available, and loves what he does. He's not too keen about his new commanding officer, Lt. Col. Jim Herlihy. The two of them had a run-in some 6 years earlier during the Korean war when Herlihy ordered Chuck to repair his aircraft putting some of his crew in danger. Chuck recognizes that Herlihy is a good pilot and a fair commander but he's not happy when he starts dating his attractive daughter Lois. His daughter had been pushing him to retire and take a high paying job in the aircraft industry and he's finally agreed to do so even with the arrival of the sleek new B-52 bomber. A crisis during a long-range flight changes everything.
