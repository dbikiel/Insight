As a band plays for a crowd in a certain town square in Osaka, a young man rushes the stage, grabs the microphone, and begins to sing. The crowd is blown away by the man's singing voice, but after the performance, band manager Kasumi discovers that the man has no memory of his own life other than his talent for singing. Kasumi becomes interested in working with him anyway, and gives him the nickname "Pochi Otoko" (dog man). Before long, Pochi Man is accepted as the lead vocalist of a band, but a major problem from his past will soon come back to haunt him.
