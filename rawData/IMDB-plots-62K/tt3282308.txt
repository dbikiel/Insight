WHAT WE HAVE is is the tale of Maurice, a prisoner of his past who is unable to connect with the people in his new Northern Canadian small town, a community that is only too ready to welcome this European misfit into their arms.
Haunted by his life on stage in France, Maurice Lesmers seeks refuge in a remote town in Northern Canada. To make ends meet, Maurice takes a job tutoring French to 15 year old Allan, a shy student struggling at school; and lands the leading role in the local theatrical production of Moliere's The Miser. Maurice is surprisingly drawn to the stage manager, Michael but as Michael pushes for a relationship with Maurice, Maurice becomes tormented by childhood memories and recklessly immerses himself in Allan's adolescent world to protect Allan from a high school bully. When Allen misinterprets Maurice's attention for affection, Maurice's past catches up with him and he must confront a dark secret in order to stay in the community.
Exploring the recent phenomenon of European immigration to Canada, What We Have charts the journey of Maurice Lesmers, a gay Frenchman, who finds himself 'lost in translation' in Northern Ontario. Fleeing from his troubled past in France, Maurice's romantic sense of Canada leads him to seek refuge in a remote community where he discovers little outlet for his Parisian appetite for one-night stands. Maurice takes a job tutoring French to 15-year old Allan, a shy student struggling at school, and auditions for the local Francophone production of Moli√®re's The Miser. When he lands the leading role, Maurice is surprisingly drawn to the theatre company's charismatic manager, Michael. But their relationship is endangered when Maurice gets caught up in Allan's adolescent world and risks everything to protect his young student who develops a hard-to-resist attraction for his enigmatic European mentor.
