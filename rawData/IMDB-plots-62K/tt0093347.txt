A murderer who assumes the identity of a new deputy is unbeknownst to the sheriff planning to pin a separate murder on him.
A psychopath murders a man who was on his way to a job as a deputy sheriff in a small California coastal resort town. He takes on the deputy's identity and arrives in town to start his new "job." What he doesn't know is that the recently appointed sheriff and his mistress are plotting to murder her evil husband and blame it on the new deputy.
