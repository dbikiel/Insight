Stefano Pelloni is an Italian highwaymen known as Il Passatore, loved by women but despised by lawmen. Together with his two man band he always manages to escape the law and head back to his woman, Mora, who would just as soon see him hanging up his pistols and going straight. But the police commissioner has had enough and begins to conceive of every possible means to catch Il Passatore red handed.
