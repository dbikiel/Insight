A couple elopes to get married and set up home hoping that just love will do the trick - but that's just the beginning of their story.
Running away from home can't keep a couple together. A signed paper can't keep a couple together. Love can. While for most Love Stories, marriage is the "goal", the fact remains that marriage is just the beginning. Saathiya continues on, from where most love stories end. From the infatuation stage "when a couple thinks they are in love" right through to "when a couple discovers the true meaning of love". Aditya (Vivek Oberoi) and Suhani (Rani Mukerji) met and fell in love. But when they eloped and set up home hoping that just Love will do the trick - well that's just the beginning of their story.
