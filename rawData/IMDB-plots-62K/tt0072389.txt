Palestinian guerrillas, Israeli commandos and an American colonel fight to keep a nuclear warhead mistakenly dropped in the Jordanian desert by a U.S. Air Force nuclear bomber.
A weapons expert is reluctantly sent on a mission to a middle-east warzone to locate a lost nuclear warhead and dismantle it before it falls into the wrong hands. But before he can complete his work, he is taken prisoner and thrust into the conflict, and finds himself looking out for more than just the warhead.
