The tale that the house was not stoked throughout the century.
Ivan is a simple village boy who has absolutely no money. He lives with his old mother. Vanya goes to the bazaar to sell his last hat, the last shirt, the jacket with pockets, but changes clothes for the cat Mashka, the dog Juju and the snake Scarapeya. A little later Vanya found out that the snake is not simple, but magic: it turned out that she was a "snake-king's daughter". For the fact that Vanya saved her, she gave him a magic ring, with the help of which any desire can be fulfilled.
