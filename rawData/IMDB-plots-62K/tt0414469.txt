The movie talks about the life of Ryan Larkin, a gifted Canadian animator of the late '60s and the early '70s.
Chris Landreth introduces himself to us in a funky restroom and then introduces the film's subject, Ryan Larkin, a brilliant animator in the 1960s and early 1970s. Chris shows us clips of "Walking" and "Street Musique," Ryan's ground-breaking shorts. We now see Ryan as he is: emaciated, alcoholic, much of his mind gone; we meet Felicity Fanjoy, his love during his creative period, and Derek Lamb, his producer. Ryan talks to Chris in the dining hall of what is probably a homeless shelter or soup kitchen. Chris tries an intervention. We follow Ryan out into the street where he panhandles. The animation, which uses live footage, reveals the ravaged burned-out graceful man.
Filmmaker and animator Chris Landreth uses his media as the conduit to try and entice one of his friends and animator idols, Ryan Larkin to resume his animation career. Larkin was one of the most promising and original voices in animation in the late 1960's and early 1970's, with his short En marchant (1968) earning him an Academy Award nomination. Larkin's short animation career ended in the early 1970's when, spurred on by his fragile emotional state, he turned to cocaine and alcohol, the latter a substance he currently still abuses. Despite his encouragements to Larkin, Landreth himself can see how one might fall into such predicaments based on his own family history.
