A film crew making a low budget vampire film is unaware that the leading man is a real vampire and has his sights set on the leading lady.
The macho Italian vampire Baisez appears on the set of a low-budget film about vampirism and billiards and seduces the cast and crew.
NOTE: Sequel to "Graveyard Shift" (1987)Camilla [Wendy Gazelle] wants to be a star, and she'll give anything to be one. Stephen Tsepes, now calling himself Baisez [Silvio Oliviero], wants to live again but needs a body to do it in. Right now, Camilla is starring in a B vampire movie set in a poolhall. Camilla invites Baisez to take her body and kills herself so that he can do it. When the actor playing the vampire in the movie dies (thanks to Camilla), Baisez arrives to audition for the part. He is perfect, of course. Soon, the other cast members begin dying or being sucked by Baisez. Camilla begins to turn vampire. Camilla's boyfriend Matthew [Mark Soper] bargains for Camilla's soul by playing pool with Baisez. Matthew kills Baisez with a poolstick and with sunlight, but Camilla becomes a vampire anyway. She is last seen pool sharking for souls.
