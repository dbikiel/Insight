Horace's milieu also includes Martha and Spencer, a married couple of ex-gangsters now living a mundane life supplementing their income by throwing occasional S&amp;M orgies for a few dollars. Queenie's crowd includes Skip, her fianc√©, an ambitious Wall Street broker, and her best friend, Tzocki, who is about to be married.
