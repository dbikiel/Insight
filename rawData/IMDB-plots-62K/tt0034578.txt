Inspired by Churchill's Dunkirk speech, brash, undisciplined bush pilot Brian MacLean and three friends enlist in the RCAF but are deemed too old to be fliers.
Brian McLean is a ruthless bush-pilot in Canada. He offers some other pilots an opportunity of earning a lot of money, but he marries the girl-friend of one of them. After listening to Churchill's famous "Blood, Sweat and tears" radio address he and some other pilots decide to join the RCAF - and his superior is always the pilot who's girlfriend he has married. Due to this and the fact, that McLean doesn't like to obey he gets troubles.
Brian MacLean is a bush pilot in the Canadian north and he's making a nasty reputation for himself. He's undercutting his fellow bush pilots' prices and seeks out jobs that have already been promised to others. He even steals rival Johnny Dutton's fianc√©e Emily Foster to keep him from marrying her. After a short-lived honeymoon in Ottawa, MacLean decides to enlist in the Royal Canadian Air Force. Like many others, he's itching to get to Europe where World War II is raging but Mac Lean has some difficulty adapting to the RCAF way of flying and giving up his fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants approach. After causing a death, he is expelled from the Air Force but using an old friend's identity, takes a on a job as a civilian pilot where he still hopes to get in on the action.
