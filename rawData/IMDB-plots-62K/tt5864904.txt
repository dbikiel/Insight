A group of scientists discover a soul guide and perform an experiment on her even though such ungodly act could cause space and time to bend and alter the very fabric of the universe.
In an attempt to prove there is life after death a group of scientists perform an experiment in which they euthanize a group of terminally ill subjects. In the process of the experiment they capture a psychopomp - a guide of souls. Psychopomps are believed to have been guiding souls from one plane to the next since the beginning of time and appear in Greek, Egyptian and Hindu mythology. But by capturing one of these psychopomps this group of scientists may have inadvertently changed everything we know about time and space as well as life and death, forever.
