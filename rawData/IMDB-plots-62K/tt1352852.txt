Troublemaking duo Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonanno, posing as their industrious alter-egos, expose the people profiting from Hurricane Katrina, the faces behind the environmental disaster in Bhopal, and other shocking events.
The film consists of a several pranks on major corporations and governmental agencies that are performed by Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonanno (in real life Jacques Servin &amp; Igor Vamos) who fancy themselves serious anti-globalization activists. The two pose as executives from Exxon, Dow Chemical, Halliburton and the H.U.D. They give faux corporate interviews pretending to be DOW executives in which they supposedly announce setting up a $12 billion fund for the victims of the 1984 Bhopal disaster that killed 1,773 people. The BBC fell for this prank and aired the faux interview. This caused DOW's stock plummet. Our mindless heroes celebrate their power, but fail to realize that most of DOW's stock is held by pension funds; in other words, regular working class retirees. The dynamic duo conveniently found a few such victims who claimed to enjoy the hoax and its impact on DOW's stock.
