With a brand-new deck of playing cards in his hand, an elegantly-attired thaumaturge enters a lavishly decorated stage and places an enormous blank card atop a sturdy decorative bench. Then, before our very eyes, by fire and the pure power of illusion, the conjurer transforms a plain nine of spades card into a full-size Queen of Hearts whose regal presence exudes elegance and gracefulness. But beware; wherever there is a Queen, there is also a King.
A bearded magician holds up a large playing card and makes it larger. He tears up a card of a queen, burns the torn bits, and a life-size Queen of Hearts card appears; then, it becomes alive. The magician puts her back into the card. The same thing happens with the King of Clubs: the card becomes alive. The king removes his costume, and there's something very familiar about him.
