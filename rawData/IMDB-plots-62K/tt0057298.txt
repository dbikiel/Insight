Wealthy rancher G.W. McLintock uses his power and influence in the territory to keep the peace between farmers, ranchers, land-grabbers, Indians and corrupt government officials.
George Washington McLintock, "GW" to friends and foes alike, is a cattle baron and the richest man in the territory. He anxiously awaits the return of his daughter Becky who has been away at school for the last two years. He's also surprised to see that his wife Katherine has also returned. She had left him some years before without really explaining what he had done, but she does make the point of saying that she's returned to take their daughter back to the State Capitol with her. GW is highly respected by everyone around him, including the farmers who are pouring into the territories with free grants of land and the Indians who are under threat of being relocated to another reservation. Between his wife, his headstrong daughter, the crooked land agent and the thieving government Indian agent, GW tries to keep the peace and do what is best for everyone.
On pins and needles all day, waiting for the return of his daughter from college, the influential and self-made cattle king, mining, and timber baron, George Washington McLintock, has one more visitor: his estranged and obstinate wife, Katherine. With his empire carved out of a wilderness, the sudden arrival of settlers creates extra tension among the ranchers, and to further complicate matters, the territorial governor, Cuthbert H. Humphrey, bullies the local Comanche Indians, forcing them to abandon their land. For a small and dusty town near Mesa Verde, this is a bit more excitement than one could handle. Now, the Fourth of July celebration is just around the corner. Will G.W. reconcile with Katherine?
