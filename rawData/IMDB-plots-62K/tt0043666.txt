During WW2, an American woman posing as an Italian cabaret owner spies on the Japanese in Manila but becomes the target of a suspicious Japanese intelligence officer.
Begins in documentary style when U. S. Army General Mark Clark authenticates Claire Phillips' adventures and achievements, as an American citizen who rendered invaluable services to her country in Manila during the Japanese occupation, and at the end, when she is presented a medal by a Presidential representative: Claire Phillips, a caf√© entertainer in Manila, marries a U.S. soldier on December 8, 1941, after the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese, and when he is killed fighting the Japanese invasion of the Phillipines, she returns to her calling as a means of obtaining and transmitting to the American and Filipino guerillas information, supplies and services which the Filipino underground uses in its aid to the Allied forces fighting the Japanese invaders. She has narrow escapes from detection and detention, until she is finally exposed as a spy, arrested, convicted and imprisoned.
After the Japanese invasion of the Phillipines, an American woman takes the identity of a dead Italian showgirl and spies on the Japanese patrons of a Manila cabaret but her activities raise the suspicion of a Japanese intelligence officer.
