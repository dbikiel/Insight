A cowboy has to get 12,000 dollars in stolen bonds from the ex-girlfriend of his partner, or the gang holding him hostage will kill him.
Chris Foster and Bert Pickett are two drifters who are passing through the border town of Adonde. There, a drunken Bert gets into a brawl at a card game and punches the town sheriff.Chris tries to help Bert get away but the sheriff arrests both men.The town doesn't have a jail and the sheriff usually chains the prisoners by the neck to a wooden post in the town square.Bert and Chris, wearing iron collars around their necks, are chained to the post. Also chained to the same post are the town drunk and the violent gang of famous wanted outlaw Lavalle. The outlaws have more to lose than Bert and Chris who only have to serve a few days chained to the post.Therefore, Lavalle and his men start digging around the post to free themselves.Unfortunatelly, they also force Bert and Chris to participate in the escape attempt.
