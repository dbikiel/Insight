Comedian Andy Kaufman &amp; professional wrestler Classy Freddie Blassie eat breakfast &amp; discuss life.
Andy Kaufman's ridiculous parody of "My Dinner With Andre" sets Andy Kaufman, playing himself, at an early-morning breakfast with former wrestling champion Fred Blassie. Andy and Fred discuss wrestling (Andy's success with wrestling women is discussed at length), then change the topic to techniques for keeping your hands clean, why not to eat pancakes or waffles, giving autographs to fans, and other topics not nearly as intellectual as the ones discussed in My Dinner With Andre. As with much of Andy Kaufman's work, My Breakfast with Blassie is extremely self-deprecating, showing Kaufman as being timid yet egotistical, using his role as Latka on Taxi as a way of trying to impress people. The video explores the egotism that develops with stardom, as well as the desire to lead a private life: the double-edged sword of being a recognizable celebrity.
