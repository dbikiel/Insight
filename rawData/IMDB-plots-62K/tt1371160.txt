About Kevin Lewis who grew up in poverty but survived to make a better life for himself and his family.
Kevin Lewis never had a chance. Growing up on a poverty-stricken London council estate, beaten and starved by his parents, bullied at school and abandoned by social services, his life was never his own. Even after he was put into care, he found himself out on the streets caught up in a criminal underworld that knew him as 'The Kid'. Yet Kevin survived to make a better life for himself. This international bestseller published in 2003 is his heartbreaking and inspiring story. The screenplay written by Mark Thomas and Kevin Lewis is a faithful adaptation of the novel.
