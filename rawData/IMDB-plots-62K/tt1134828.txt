While cleaning offices at night, George learns a lot about the employees by examining what they leave behind, carefully choosing his targets, always disillusioned women whom he seduces, methodically taking their money. An artist of manipulation, with a generous dose of humor and the ability to assume different personalities, George begins to work in a psychologist's practice, where he learns of Hanna, a 30 year-old dancer who was hurt in a car accident and the daughter of a millionaire. The ideal victim if love doesn't get in the way.
