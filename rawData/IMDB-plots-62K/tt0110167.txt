A police officer promises to share his lottery ticket with a waitress in lieu of a tip.
Charlie and Muriel Lang have led simple lives for most of their existence. That's until they win $4 million on the lottery. There is a problem, however. Prior to winning the lottery, Charlie had eaten at a caf√© and hadn't been able to tip the waitress. He had promised her, jokingly, that if he won the lottery he'd give her half of it. This is why his wife, Muriel, decides to leave him. She doesn't want the waitress to get a cent of their money. In fact, she wants all $4 million for herself.
Kind, soft-spoken, and with a heart of gold, the devoted husband and dutiful NYPD officer, Charlie Lang, finds himself short of money at the diner where the honest and recently bankrupt waitress, Yvonne Biasi, works. To get out of this embarrassing predicament, Charlie promises to share half of his lottery ticket winnings in lieu of a tip, unbeknownst to him that he is holding a winning $4-million-dollar lotto ticket. As a result--much to the disappointment of his rapacious wife, Muriel--Charlie has to keep his word; after all, there's still more than enough money to indulge herself in an endless consumer frenzy. Now, what would you do if it happened to you?
Charlie Lang, a New York cop with a heart of gold, wins a share of the lottery. However, the day before, having been caught without enough money to tip waitress (Yvonne), Charlie offers her half the winnings. Charlie's wife, Muriel, is the complete opposite of her husband. She wants more and more money, and she's not impressed by Charlie's honest and kind nature. As Charlie and Muriel grow apart, Charlie and Yvonne grow together.
