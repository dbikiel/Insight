This shows a prince entering upon the stage of the King's private theatre. He is about to do a few mystifying tricks for the amusement of the court. Taking a large sheet of cardboard, he rolls it into the shape of a tube. Showing that it is entirely empty, he holds it over the table, and a figure is seen gradually coming into view; and before the eye can perceive the change we behold a beautiful Tyrol dancing girl standing on the table with the tube around her. Lifting the tube over her head, the prince assists her down from the table and she executes a tambourine dance. Then, placing a chair and a stool on the stage, he hypnotizes her. Drawing the tube over her he places her horizontally supported by the head and feet. She is next seen to fade away, only to reappear standing on the table. He takes her hand to assist her down. When she reaches the floor, we behold the princess in her place. The prince attempts to kiss her and finds that he is going to kiss the Tyrolese. Bidding her sit in the other chair, he sees the princess come into view. Taking her arm, he leaves the stage. This is a beautiful subject and very entertaining.
