A freshly-out-of-the-grave band of Hard Rock Zombies is thirsting to take their sweet revenge, as they give the performance of a lifetime.
A hard rock band travels to the tiny and remote town of Grand Guignol to perform. Peopled by hicks, rubes, werewolves, murderous dwarves, sex perverts, and Hitler, the town is a strange place but that doesn't stop the band's lead singer from falling in love with a local girl named Cassie. After Nazi sex perverts kill the band to satisfy their lusts, Cassie calls the rockers back from the grave to save her, the town, and maybe the world.
On the road to stardom, Holly Moses, lead singer Jessie's hot hair metal band is heading to the small coastal town of Grand Guignol with the intention of playing a gig that would open all doors to fame and success. However, what seemed like a journey that would fulfil their dreams, will soon turn into a hellish adventure, as the unaware band encounters a mysterious family with a thing for torture and murder. But from beyond, the freshly-out-of-the-grave band of Hard Rock Zombies is bound to take their sweet revenge, as they give the performance of a lifetime. Who says zombies can't rock?
