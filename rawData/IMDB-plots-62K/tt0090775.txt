A group of high school students, led by a rich boy Derek, is sick of school violence and decides to become underground vigilantes named "Brotherhood of Justice". It starts with the idea of "watching people", but things quickly get out of control. "Brotherhood of Justice" turns out to be another gang of violence. Derek wants to stop it but it is too late, so he takes responsibility for it and gives himself to the law.
When vandals damage the Santa Lucia High School, the principal Bob Grootemat (Joe Spano) joins the classes and presents a lecture to the students about the problems with vandals, drug dealers and other bad elements. Six friends - the students and football players Derek, Scottie, Mule, Collin , Barnwell and Les - decide to form a group of vigilantes to punish the delinquents and they call themselves "The Brotherhood of Justice". But the problem is when they decide to use their power for personal issues with other mates and lose control.
