A concert film in which Bill Cosby discusses weekends, raising children, dentists, and many other situations.
Comedian Bill Cosby brings down the house to an audience in Ontario, Canada in a two-hour show where he pontificates on several subjects, such as drugs, drunkeness, and the follies of dentists, before launching into his primary subject matter, the hilariously pernicious antics of his family, from childbirth to college football to enduring a noisy four-year-old on a transcontinental flight to his son's bizarre hairdos to his wife's marginally restrained reaction to a childrens' squabble over the right to shower to his own father's nicknames to himself and his brother Russell.
Comedian Bill Cosby performs an on-stage monologue in May 1981 at the Hamilton Place Theatre in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. He begins by discussing drug and alcohol abuse among his employees, and satirizes the effects of marijuana and cocaine, then questions the logic of equating drunkenness and its accompanying nausea as having a good time.Cosby addresses the discomforts of being a dental patient, followed by an extended discussion of the tribulations of parenthood, starting with "natural childbirth." He quotes comedienne Carol Burnett, who likened labor pains to pulling one's lower lip over their head. As the children grow, Cosby remembers his mother's wish that he would have children as badly behaved as he was, which he now considers to be a curse.In the segment "Brain Damage", he comments on being the parent of four girls and one boy, and how the girls tend to conspire against their brother. Cosby describes how parenthood has taken a physical and intellectual toll on his wife and himself: he is constantly overwhelmed, his wife has a permanent frown, and both have lost the ability to speak in complete sentences.The comedian relates the story of a dignified, upper-class woman who brought her four-year-old son, "Little Jeffrey", on a transcontinental flight, where the child proceeded to annoy the passengers and cause his mother a great deal of stress. Upon arriving at their destination, the woman was met by her ex-husband, whom she immediately punched in the face for leaving the imp with her for weeks.In "Kill the Boy", Cosby dispels the myth of honesty among children by demonstrating how a baby can begin lying at 15 months of age. The subject changes to the average father's ineptitude around children, a ploy that tends to relieve him of parental responsibility. However, women take their marital vows seriously, and often demand obedience from their husbands, which they accept in exchange for a reduced workload.For the segment "Chocolate Cake for Breakfast", Cosby relates how he tried to cook breakfast one Saturday morning for his kids, despite not knowing how to cook and having to make cake batter using eggs and milk, until his wife walked in to see the huge mess made in the kitchen and the kids having to eat the chocolate cake.In "Same Thing Happens Every Night", Cosby then describes the ordeal of getting his five children ready for bed each night, and the unending need for his wife to act as disciplinarian.In "Grandparents", he expresses his amazement at the unprecedented patience and kindness he has witnessed in his own mother and father since becoming grandparents, and accuses them of "trying to get into heaven" as they approach death. The comedian concludes his show by mentioning his father's favorite game, "Pull My Finger."
