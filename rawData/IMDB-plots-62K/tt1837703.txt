A dramatic thriller based on real events that reveals the quest to expose the deceptions and corruptions of power that turned an Internet upstart into the 21st century's most fiercely debated organization.
The story begins as WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and his colleague Daniel Domscheit-Berg (Daniel Brühl) team up to become underground watchdogs of the privileged and powerful. On a shoestring, they create a platform that allows whistle-blowers to anonymously leak covert data, shining a light on the dark recesses of government secrets and corporate crimes. Soon, they are breaking more hard news than the world's most legendary media organizations combined. But when Assange and Berg gain access to the biggest trove of confidential intelligence documents in U.S. history, they battle each other and a defining question of our time: what are the costs of keeping secrets in a free society-and what are the costs of exposing them?
The movie opens with Assange hiring Daniel Domscheit-Berg (Daniel Brühl), a fellow tech whiz, to help him keep his new website operational. The site gave whistle-blowers an entirely anonymous platform to share classified documents, and soon the pair find themselves in possession of information that will bring down a corrupt bank. As their power and influence grows, they must consider teaming with established media sources, especially when they are sent documents that would reveal ultra-sensitive state secrets from some of the world's most-powerful governments..
