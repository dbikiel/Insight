Doc Holliday, the cold-blooded sharp-shooter, reunites with his old friend, Marshall Wyatt Earp, to take down the Clanton gang in the dusty town of Tombstone, in Arizona.
One night of 1881, Doc Holliday, a famous poker gambler, enters the 'No Name Saloon'. There, he challenges a man to poker, betting his horse against his opponent's fiance. Doc wins and from now on, Katie Fisher, also known as Katie Elder, will follow him wherever he goes. Their next destination is Tombstone, where the law is represented by Sheriff Wyatt Earp. When they arrive, the election campaign is in full swing. Earp runs for candidate but the Clantons, a family gang of outlaw cowboys, are not among his keenest supporters. Conflict erupts following the failure of some shadowy bargaining and Doc decides to join Wyatt and his brothers. The four of them gather at the O.K. Corral where the seven Clanton brothers are waiting for them.
After winning the young prostitute, Katie Elder, over a game of cards, the cold-blooded sharp-shooter who suffers from tuberculosis, Doc Holliday, rides to Tombstone in Arizona, through the unforgiving desert. Nearing the end of his life, Doc will reunite with his old friend, Marshall Wyatt Earp, who has plans of his own regarding the dusty town and needs Doc's lightning-fast right hand to fulfil them, and in the process, take down the Clanton gang. As the tension keeps rising in Tombstone, everything leads to the terrible final confrontation at the O.K. Corral, where those with shotguns will have the upper hand.
