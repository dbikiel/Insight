Dimwitted, meaty guy foils criminals by turning invisible.
Ever-so mellow Agent Sam Casey is in a satellite explosion and the radiation turns him invisible. He gets a watch that keeps him visible, and he uses it to switch from visible to invisible. He is assigned to transport a chemical called Tripolydine, which is purported to be the most efficient fuel; when the cover is blown on that and he uncovers and stops the Tripolydine fraud, he must then stop terrorist Robert Denby from blowing up racecars.
Sam Casey is a government agent who investigates a sunken satellite. He is exposed to radiation which makes him invisible but the lab technicians are able to give him a watch that lets him control his invisibility. He becomes a valuable asset in the fight against terrorists and an evil "doctor" who attempts to embezzle $10 million from the government by creating a new fuel that turns out to be an explosive.
