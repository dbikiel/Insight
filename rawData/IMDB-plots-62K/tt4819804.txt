A story of Hong Kong told by three generations of real people: 'preschooled' children, 'preoccupied' young people, and 'preposterous' senior citizens.
"Hong Kong Trilogy: Preschooled Preoccupied Preposterous" is a story of Hong Kong told by three generations: "Preschooled" children, "Preoccupied" young people, and "Preposterous" senior citizens. We spent a year recording interviews with over a hundred people of all ages and backgrounds. These recordings are edited to make a blueprint for the film. From this, we created a quasi-fictional narrative that the real (non-actor) person acts out while we hear (in voice-over) how they see and experience the world. In "Preschooled," "Little Red Cap" tries to resolve the question "Why are there so many gods in this world? Is it because so many people need to be saved?" by evangelizing all the major faiths to her schoolmates. "Vodka Wong" releases plastic turtles to redeem the bad karma that resulted from his parents' neglect of him. In "Preoccupied," young people occupy the streets of Central, Hong Kong. They stop the city to think about what they want for their future. Twenty-eight-year-old "Thierry the Feng Shui Master" and her crew of underground rappers and artists give voice to their discontent. "Lady Swim" and "Mister Li" look "Preposterous" as they go on a speed-dating tour of the city trying to reconcile their new energies and the obligations convention has imposed on them. The characters of each generation wonder how to live, here and now. At the end of their journey, they find no answers. Yet what they do find is that they are not alone in asking the universal questions that we all share: who we are, how we fit in, and what our city wants to become together.
