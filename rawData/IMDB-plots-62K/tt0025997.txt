Donald and his friend Peter Pig try to avoid work by faking stomach aches until Mrs. Hen teaches them the value of labor.
The hen is looking for someone to help her plant her corn. Peter Pig and Donald Duck both feign belly aches to get out of the chore. So, with help from her chicks, she plants it herself. Harvest time comes; again, Peter and Donald claim belly aches. She cooks up a variety of corn dishes, and heads over to Peter and Donald, but before she can open her mouth, they already have their belly aches. Once she asks, they are miraculously "cured" but all she gives them is castor oil, for their belly aches.
