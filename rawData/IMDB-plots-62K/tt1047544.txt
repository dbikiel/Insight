During WWII, a pilot and her crew carry a small group of American soldiers and an unknown cargo. However they get caught in a storm and they are forced to land in what is thought to be enemy territory. But the small island they land on holds more than men with guns.
In the midst of World War 2, an OSS officer leads a group of female pilots on a mission to deliver a secret weapon, only to crash land on an island in the Pacific after an encounter with a deadly storm. On the island, they must not only contend with a small band of Japanese soldiers but the native inhabitants of the island as well - vicious prehistoric pterosaurs.In the final days of WWII, Woman's Air Corp leader Max West (Jamie Elle West) and her crew are ordered to accompany OSS officer, Col. Jack Toller (Brian Krause), his team, and cargo on a secret mission.They crash land on a remote Pacific island. Toller orders a recon of the area and soon discovers a small base that is badly damaged but not by the ravages of war. Soon they capture a squadron of Japanese pilots lead by Capt. Ozu (Tohoru Masamune) and learn that the island is home to gigantic prehistoric pterosaurs.After a failed attempt to fly a zero out to get help, the Americans move ahead with their plan to repair their damaged bomber with the help from the Japanese.A struggle between what is morally right and what is necessary to win the war (as viewed by each side) is explored as the plane is prepared to take off.
