Right after winning a fight in Las Vegas, Kurt Sloane is sedated and taken to a prison in Bangkok, where he's forced to fight a 6'10" giant for freedom and $1M - but this will require some intense training.
One year after the events of "Kickboxer: Vengeance", Kurt Sloan has vowed never to return to Thailand. However, while gearing up for a MMA title shot, he finds himself sedated and forced back into Thailand, this time in prison. He is there because the ones responsible want him to face a 6'8" 400 lbs. beast named Mongkut and in return for the fight, Kurt will get one million dollars and his freedom back. Kurt at first refuses, in which a bounty is placed on his head as a way to force him to face Mongkut. Kurt soon learns he will have no other choice and will undergo his most rigorous training yet under some unexpected mentors in order to face Mongkut in hopes to regain his freedom. But is later beaten up by mongkut in the the first, but later gears up and defeated mongkut thereby gaining his freedom and pay.
