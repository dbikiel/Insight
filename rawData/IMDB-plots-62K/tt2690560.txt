The Warwick family are unknowingly being filmed for a new reality show. Problem is, they're boring. So the producer, Mickey Wagner, must add conflict and drama. Their lives begin to unravel with shocking consequences.
Shooting the Warwicks is a darkly comedic satire about reality TV producer Mickey Wagner and his amoral attempt to re-invent the genre. Mickey's revolutionary idea is to pick an average family and put them under all-encompassing surveillance...without their knowledge. Unfortunately, Mickey soon realizes that the family is boring. In a desperate attempt to salvage the show, Mickey begins to interfere by injecting conflict to create drama. As the show gets better, the family starts to disintegrate. Mickey rationalizes that all will be OK in the end, for once the episodes begin airing, fame will heal all wounds.
