Tara Talbot (Victoria Sanchez) is afflicted with the rare genetic condition known as hypertrichosis - she is covered head to toe in hair. She lives her life in Harley Dune's (Tim Curry's) Travelling Freak Show, on display as the "Terrifying Wolf Girl", but underneath she is just a teenage girl who longs to be normal.
