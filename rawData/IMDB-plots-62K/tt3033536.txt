A retelling of Disney's Aladdin (1992), from the perspective of Jafar.
In a once-great kingdom, the Royal Vizier must set off on an adventure to save his city from its bumbling Sultan, an invading prince, and the most notorious thief who's ever lived. This twisted quest for magic lamp containing a wish-granting Djinn (who's really funny, by the way) celebrates and lovingly pokes fun at everyone's favorite series of hand-drawn animated musicals.
