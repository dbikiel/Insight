She calls her godmother, a librarian, for bail money after being arrested for throwing an illegal party. To repay the loan, she begins working as a library clerk. At first she hates it, but when challenged decides to master the Dewey Decimal System and become a great library clerk, while romancing a falafel vendor and helping her roommate in his goal to become a professional DJ.
24 year old Mary (Parker Posey) is earning her rent money by throwing yet another party at her loft but, this time she gets busted. Now Mary has to rely on her godmother, Judy, to bail her out. Mary visits the library to thank Judy, who is head librarian, for her kindness, but instead finds herself admonished by Judy for lack of responsibility and inability to hold down a job. In her defense, Mary agrees to take up a job as a library clerk. She assumed Judy would let her be, but instead, Judy constantly criticizes Mary's abilities. Steamed by Judy's dismissal of her lifestyle, Mary is determined to prove herself and in the process realizes a sense of responsibility and self-worth. The one time Party Girl has metamorphosed into a young mature woman.
