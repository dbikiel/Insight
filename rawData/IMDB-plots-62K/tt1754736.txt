From the northern ice comes a gentler kind of hero.
Theo, an Inuit from the Arctic, travels to New York City to warn world leaders about the catastrophic impact of global warming on the planet. Upon arrival he meets a homeless girl named Chloe, who has an unusual vigor for life, is mildly delusional, and completely obsessed by Bruce Lee. Together, they will save the world.
Theo, an Inuit living a traditional aboriginal life in the Arctic, is sent by his community elders to the south, specifically New York City, to speak to "their" elders to warn them of the impending damage to humanity of climate change. As Theo wanders around the city not knowing quite where to go to carry out his mission, he is spotted by Chloe, a young street woman who can see that he is a fish out of water. She takes him under her wing as she does with many "strays" as her friends call them. Theo and Chloe find that they have to get a grasp on the differences in their vernacular to understand each other. Chloe also introduces him to some of her friends, some who join them on their mission, if only for their own benefit. But as Theo, Chloe and her friends truly begin to know each other and how each can help the other, the New Yorkers may get a better appreciation for Theo's global message. However, as street people, Chloe and her friends are also seen as being outsiders to the upper echelons of power and authority, and thus may not be as much help as they would like in Theo's mission.
