"King of the slack wire. His daring feats of balancing as he performs his thrilling feats in midair show that he is perfectly at home." (from Edison Films)
In a fenced back yard with the neighboring house visible in the distance, a stationary camera films Juan Caicedo in profile on a rope. Holding one pole while another bounces, Juan does several back flips and a few steps walking. He lands each flip straddling the rope then springs onto his feet for the next trick.
