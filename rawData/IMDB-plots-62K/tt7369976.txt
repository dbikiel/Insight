What is life like in a southern Italian city, nestled between two of Europe's largest industrial plants: a coal fired power plant and a petrochemical plant? What is left of the promises of progress and development? Two farmers living and working under the two plants and a somewhat fleeting environmentalist scuba diver try to prove the economic and health damage inflicted by the facilities. The press officer of the power plant, however, tells a completely different story. While the inhabitants of the city attend cultural and sporting events funded by the industries, truth and justice remain suspended and unattainable, like in a Kafkaesque trial.
