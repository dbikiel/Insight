2 friends graduate college and start at a law firm. Hogan is into cougars. Spence needs his employer's recommendation for Yale Law so being with his wife isn't smart. He helps Hogan start Cougar Club.
When Spence and Hogan graduate from college, life is bleak. They have to work for heinous divorce lawyers that torture them. Spence has a girlfriend from hell and Hogan just wants to start his life already. As luck would have it, our two young men are presented with an opportunity, they develop a club of young men devoted to the older woman, the "Cougar" if you will. It is this club that ultimately guides our two heroes into young adulthood.
