Swedes travel to the Canary Islands on a package trip.
Stig-Helmer Olsson isn't the fashionable jet-set type, but, for the first time in his life, he's going to travel abroad. He chooses a trip to the Canary Islands over Christmas. Before leaving, his doctor asks him to bring a package to a friend of his. Without Stig-Helmer knowing it, the package contains 50,000 SEK, which is illegal to bring out of the country. However, Stig-Helmer's bag with the package disappears at the airport. Dr. Levander's friend believes that Stig-Helmer has stolen the money and is anxious to get them back.
