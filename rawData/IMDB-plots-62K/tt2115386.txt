Amid the boundless ice-cold ocean, the fortunate survivor, Scrat, finally finds a tiny islet, willing to go to great lengths to get his precious acorns; however, all that glitters is not gold. Will Scrat ever learn?
Scrat is still floating on his ice float when he spots an island. He rows to the island and takes a rest at the bottom of a coconut tree. Scrat sees the skeleton of another Scrat. He is scared and then hides. Later, he investigates the skeleton. He follows the Scrat's arm and sees an acorn very deep under water. Scrat then comes up with a plan. The plan being to jump into the water while holding a rock to make him heavy enough to sink quickly. On the way down, he lost his nose and his body becomes very thin due to the crushing pressure. He picks up the acorn and realizes it's only half an acorn. He sees the back of the acorn, which has a picture of map to the giant acorn. He runs out of oxygen and starts to float downwards. Suddenly a marlin skeleton got the acorn map. Scrat is pulled by it and crashes into seaweeds, a salmon and a crab.
Amid the boundless ice-cold ocean, the fortunate survivor, Scrat, finally finds land--a tiny islet in the middle of nowhere. Exhausted but always willing to go to great lengths to get his precious acorns, the half-starved and desperate castaway follows the signs to his beloved treasure; however, all that glitters is not gold. Will Scrat ever learn?
