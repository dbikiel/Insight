Durga Devi has three sons, Ram, Laxman and Bharat. She wants a heir to carry the family name forward. Ram and Laxman are married and have so far only produced girls, much to their mother's disgust. So when Bharat marries Priya, she is expecting them to have a son. But Priya delivers a baby girl. Anticipating the mother's anger, they hide the gender of the child initially, and subsequently; switch their child with another male child, thus giving rise to more conflicts.
Durga Bhatnagar runs her household in a very strict and orthodox manner. She has three sons: Ram, Laxman, and Bharat, and her husband's name is Dashrath - all linked to Ramayan. She wants her sons to marry and bear sons, so that there is a male heir for the next generation also. Both Ram and Laxman incur her wrath when they do not sire males. When Bharat marries Priya, their first child is a female, so both decide to hide the gender of the child initially, and subsequently switch her with a male to satisfy Durga. But how long will they continue with this charade, and pulling wool over her eyes?
