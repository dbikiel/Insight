The story of Japanese-American soldiers who fought in Europe during World War II.
A tribute to the U.S. 442nd Regimental Combat Team, formed in 1943 by Presidential permission with Japanese-American volunteers. We follow the training of a platoon under the rueful command of Lt. Mike Grayson who shares common prejudices of the time. The 442nd serve in Italy, then France, distinguishing themselves in skirmishes and battles; gradually and naturally, Grayson's prejudices evaporate with dawning realization that his men are better soldiers than he is. Not preachy.
The most decorated unit in US military history, and made up of Japanese-American volunteers, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team fights heroically despite widespread prejudice from fellow soldiers. The 442 battles the Nazis while slogging through Italy, and suffering humiliation from their scornful commander, Lt. Grayson (Van Johnson), who eventually comes to see his men in a much more complimentary way. The film features many actual surviving WW II veterans of the 442nd Regiment.
