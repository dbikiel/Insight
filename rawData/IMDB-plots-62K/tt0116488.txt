A group of washed-up Canadian punk rockers get back together for a road trip in memory of a dear friend who was supposedly shot, or so rumors imply. As they travel, they ignore the underlying psychological darkness within each other.
Bruce Macdonald follows punk bank Hard Core Logo on a harrowing last-gasp reunion tour throughout Western Canada. As magnetic lead-singer Joe Dick holds the whole magilla together through sheer force of will, all the tensions and pitfalls of life on the road come bubbling to the surface.
The successful fringe punk band, Hard Core Logo - formed in 1978 and disbanded in 1991 - are reuniting five years after their break-up for what they believe is a one-time only benefit concert for front man Joe Dick's musical idol, Bucky Haight, who lost his legs in a gun shooting. But they decide to mend their differences, which revolved primarily around their former manager Ed Festus and the strong personalities of the two front men, Joe Dick and Billy Tallent, and embark on a concert tour of western Canada. As documentary filmmaker Bruce McDonald films the band on tour, the old wounds between all four band members may not have healed as Billy, arguably the band member with the brightest post-Hard Core prospects, may garner more attention than the band's true leader Joe. The problems may not be able to endure the added stress of being constantly in front of Bruce's documentary camera, which, when unedited, does not lie.
