Reuben is a drinker and brawler who runs afoul of the law and lands a long prison term. He leaves behind Roberta, his companion and mother of a brood of nine. Also part of the extended family is Beal, who becomes Roberta's sometime lover and possesses the famous Bean short fuse. All this is observed by Earlene, a neighbor under the thumb of a strict religious father. Her dad warns her against any contact, but, despite the Beans' crude ways, the young woman is drawn to them; their earthiness, directness and unity stand in sharp contrast to her oppressive family life.
