After a perfumer's death, his daughter works to meet the production deadline for his company's latest scent, which is complicated by the lack of an elusive ingredient.
After her father's premature death, Violet (Shantel VanSanten) is left with only a small vial of his last perfume, the third in a successful trilogy that is to be delivered in time for the Valentine's Day deadline. With no formula and unable to scientifically reformulate her late father's mystery blend, the pressure is on as Violet's Distributors have already pre sold and heavily marketed the most anticipated perfume of its kind. All whilst evading the notorious copycat perfume queen, Olivia Caine (Bobbie Phillips) and long-time rival who is hoping for and plotting her failure.
Violet (Shantel VanSanten) is a chemist who is carrying on the legacy of her Belgian family's perfume company by recreating her late father's secret formula. With a Valentine's Day deadline fast approaching, she meets the perfect "nose" and botanist -- the handsome Declan "Dec" Granger (Victor Webster) -- who could be the key to unlocking the missing ingredient. But when a rival perfumer (Bobbie Phillips) nearly copies the formula, Violet delays returning to her life in Boston and follows her heart instead, discovering along the way that sometimes dreams can change. "Love Blossoms" is a Leif Films/Saga Film/ Umedia production. Leif Bristow and Hubert Toint are executive producers. Agnes Bristow and Mary Pantelidis are producers. Jonathan Wright directs from a script written by Julie Kim and Karin√© Marwood.
