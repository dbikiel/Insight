Several lost-soul night-owls, including a nightclub owner, a talkback radio relationships counseller, and an itinerant stranger have encounters that expose their contradictions and anxieties about love and acceptance.
During the mid 80's Alan Rudolph became one of the most interesting ensemble cast filmmakers since Robert Altman.
His quirky boutique dramas had style and flair and a touch of the 80's hip angst. This is my favorite of that time. The art direction and camera movements are as much story tellers as the dialogue. Pay attention to the paintings and posters in the scenes. They almost always have a subtext comment to the exact scene being spoken by the actors. And Rudolph loves to let his actors act! There is a brilliant scene where Mickey (Keith Carradine) is eating breakfast with Nancy/Ann (Genevi√®ve Bujold). The camera pulls back, zooms in and pans like a tennis match as the actors go thru an unbroken 3 plus minute dialog scene. I haven't seen a scene go that long since the opening of Rope! This film is full of great dialog, style and fun!
