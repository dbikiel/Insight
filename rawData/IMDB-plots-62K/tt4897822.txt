To learn what the USA can learn from other nations, Michael Moore playfully "invades" them to see what they have to offer.
To show what the USA can learn from rest of the world, director Michael Moore playfully visits various nations in Europe and Africa as a one-man "invader" to take their ideas and practices for America. Whether it is Italy with its generous vacation time allotments, France with its gourmet school lunches, Germany with its industrial policy, Norway and its prison system, Tunisia and its strongly progressive women's policy, or Iceland and its strong female presence in government and business among others, Michael Moore discovers there is much that American should emulate.
"This is an expansive, rib-tickling, and subversive comedy in which the eccentric, left-wing, populist filmmaker Michael Moore, playing the role of 'invader,' visits a host of nations to learn how the U.S. could improve its own prospects".In the opening voice-over, Moore gives a sarcastic introduction about him visiting the Pentagon in Washington DC and given the green light to "invade" a series of countries authorized by the joint chiefs of staff. Moore leaves to "invade" Europe to discuss the subjects which he most covers in his activist work which are worker benefits, school lunches, early education, college education, worker inclusion, decriminalized drugs, low recidivism, women's health care, and women inclusion.ItalyMoore arrives and visits a factory where he discusses with the owner and various workers about labor rights and workers' well-being (paid holiday, thirteenth salary, parental leave, etc.).

Moore visits the maximum-security Bastøy Prison and Halden Prison, and Norway's response to the July 22, 2011 Utøya attacks committed by the right-wing extremist Anders Behring Breivik.TunisiaMoore meets with some women activists to discuss the evolution of women's rights in the country, including reproductive health, access to abortion and their role in the Tunisian Revolution and the drafting of the new Tunisian Constitution of 2014.IcelandMoore discusses the theme of women in power, speaking with Vigdís Finnbogadóttir, the world's first democratically elected female president of Iceland.

The film ends with a film clip of the 1939 film 'The Wizard of Oz' where he explains that the solution to the problems America is faced with is always in plain sight as with Dorothy who learns that she always had the power to travel back home to Kansas with her magical red shoes.
