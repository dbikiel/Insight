An exploration of the clothes, the glamour and the decadence of iconic fashion designer Halston.
Using archival footage of and interviews about fashion designer and icon Halston (1932-1990), Whitney Smith looks at the 1970s in Manhattan. Smith is interested in the parties and the excess, which contrast with Halston's minimalist lines. There is a rough chronology for Halston: from milliner to couture to an unsuccessful attempt to bring his designs to the customers of J.C. Penney. The principal focus is on the world of Studio 54 and Halston's part in it.
