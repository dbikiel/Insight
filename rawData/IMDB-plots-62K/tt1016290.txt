A punk's gotta do what a punk's gotta do in "Crows: Episode 0," the third picture by prolific Japanese maverick Takashi Miike to hit the fest circuit in as many months, following "Like a Dragon" and "Sukiyaki Western Django."Recalling any number of brawling student pics from Asia - and playing sometimes like a serious version of the South Korean "Conduct Zero" (2002) - this prequel to a planned adaptation of the manga by Hiroshi Takahashi, which sold more than 32 million copies in Japan, opens locally Oct. 27. In the West, "Crows" should raise a ruckus as a culty DVD title.
