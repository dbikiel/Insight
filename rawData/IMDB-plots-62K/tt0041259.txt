A singing mechanic from 1912 finds himself in Arthurian Britain.
A bump on the head sends Hank Martin, 1912 mechanic, to Arthurian Britain, 528 A.D., where he is befriended by Sir Sagramore le Desirous and gains power by judicious use of technology. He and Alisande, the King's niece, fall in love at first sight, which draws unwelcome attention from her fianc√©e Sir Lancelot; but worse trouble befalls when Hank meddles in the kingdom's politics.
While on a castle tour, American Hank Martin recounts a fabulous tale to Lord Pendragon about his journey back in time to the court of King Arthur. Working in his blacksmith's shop some years before, he was thrown from his horse and lost consciousness awaking in Camelot. He falls in love with the beautiful Alisande La Carteloise who is betrothed to Sir Lancelot. He is forced to meet him on the jousting field but betters him in his own comical way. Allisande doesn't appreciate his manner however and has to win her all over again. After helping King Arthur save his kingdom from the evil Merlin, he re-awakens in his own time.
