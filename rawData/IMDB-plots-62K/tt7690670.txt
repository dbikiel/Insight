With retirement on his mind, a successful young drug dealer sets up one last big job, while dealing with trigger-happy colleagues and the police.
When Priest, a young but experienced coke dealer in Atlanta, realizes it's time to get out of the trade, he risks it all on one last score. Double-crossing his mentor, Priest heads to Mexico to connect with the cartel that serves as the source of his product.
In this remake of the 1972 film Super Fly, Trevor Jackson plays Youngblood Priest, an Atlanta drug kingpin whose throne is threatened by a ruthless new crew with Mexican cartel connections. To protect his mentor (Michael Kenneth Williams), his best friend (Jason Mitchell) and his girlfriend (Lex Scott Davis), Priest decides to get out of the game, but only after going to Mexico to make one last big deal.
Youngblood Priest, an Atlanta cocaine dealer, has been working the streets since he was eleven. Brought in by his mentor Scatter at a young age, he has been dealing drugs ever since. He lives like a king with his two girlfriends, Georgia and Cynthia, who know about each other. One night, Juju, a member of a gang called Snow Patrol, hits on Cynthia and is furious when he finds out that she is dating Priest. Confronting him outside the strip club against Snow Patrol leader Q's wishes, he shoots at Priest but misses, hitting a bystander instead. The Snow Patrol members drive away, while Priest gives the victim and her friends money and directs them to the best trauma center in the area. After getting home, Priest has an epiphany, never wishing to get shot at again. Priest confides with his second-in-command Eddie, explaining that he wants out of the drug-dealing scene, and that he has a plan. Eddie initially resists, but eventually says that he has his back. Priest also lets Scatter know, who says that he won't help him..
