Flirtatious mermaid Miranda swaps places with a schoolteacher who has gone on holiday. All is well until she falls in love with a human.
Gymnastics school teacher Caroline Trewella inherits a house on the Cornwall coast. In the basement/smuggler's cave, she discovers mermaid Miranda. The young women share a common ancestor and are remarkably alike in looks. While Caroline is away on a bicycling tour, Miranda has fun taking her place on land. With the help of her friend Nurse Carey, Miranda feigns an injury that keeps her wheelchair-bound... or more often needing to be carried by a man. And the ever flirtatious Miranda certainly knows how to attract all the men of the village!
