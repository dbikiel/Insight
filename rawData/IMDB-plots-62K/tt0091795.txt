When his mother dies, Bob not only inherits her house, but also the custody of his younger brother, who suffers from schizophrenia and epilepsy. At the age of 21, Bob promised to look after his brother. Although he has barely seen him in the many years since then and strives against the commitment, he doesn't dare to put him in a home either.
Long absent from his family, Bob Beuhler returns home after his mother's death to find she has left him her estate and placed his brother, D.J., in his care. Harking back to a promise made many years earlier, Bob cannot bring himself to put D.J., who suffers from epilepsy and schizophrenia, in a home. Slowly, he and his brother bond, and in the process Bob rehabilitates his own scars, including the mark left on him by his childhood sweetheart.
