A chance encounter between two girls of the same name, "Nana," triggers a series of events and relationships.
A friendship is born when two twenty-year-old girls named Nana meet on the night train to Tokyo. Yet, they could not be any more different in appearance, experience or demeanour. One is a pop rock singer with an ambition to conquer the stage. The other wants to be with, and serve, her boyfriend.
