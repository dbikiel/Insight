A romantic comedy about a young man who pretends to be gay in order to rent an apartment with his dream girl. His plan backfires when she keeps trying to set him up with her male friends.
Parker Concorde, a freelance writer by trade currently working for the Psychic Pals phone service to make ends meet, is out of a home after accidentally starting a fire to his New York City apartment. Barely able to stand sacking out at his noisy pal Jack's place, he finally finds new digs with Samantha, who only rooms with gay men. With currently no other place to live, Parker allows her mistake over his sexual orientation to pass uncorrected, which later leads her to believe she's helping him out by setting him up on dates with her gay friends. Truth is - he's falling hard for her, and somewhere between dealing with her philandering boyfriend and dating other men he needs to set the record straight.
