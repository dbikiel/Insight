The story of a fastidiously organized businessman, whose perspective on life is forever changed through an unexpected encounter with a tiny fledgling bird.
As the well-organised and disciplined businessman, Mr Swift, waits for the bus on a cloudless spring morning, out of the blue, arrives the most unexpected visitor in the shape of an innocent little blue bird. At first, the already late for work commuter wants to have nothing to do with the troublesome feathery creature; however, what if those two unlikely companions had a mutually beneficial alliance? Would it change their future?
