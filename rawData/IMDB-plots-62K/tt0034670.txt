Donald Duck, in a battleship made of ice, goes to war against his three nephews, who fight back from their ice fort.
It's snowed, and Donald Duck is going sledding. Meanwhile, his nephews have built a snowman at the bottom of the hill. Donald aims his sled at their snowman and demolishes it, so the boys get even by including a boulder in the bottom of their next snowman. This means war, so they retreat to opposing snow forts for battle.
Donald Duck, excited to see that it has snowed, puts on an overcoat and brings along his sled. Merrily singing "Jingle Bells," he spots his nephews at the bottom of a hill, happily making a snowman. Donald decides to "have some fun" (as he puts it) and sleds down the hill, destroying the snowman and laughing at his nephews' misfortune.The nephews quickly build a new snowman, with a cross-eyed look and a duckbill, declaring that it's supposed to be Donald. Donald, angered at the mock-snowman of himself, sleds down the hill, intent on wrecking it, only to smash into a large rock the boys had under it. The force of the collision causes the fur on Donald's overcoat to fall off. Now his nephews are the ones laughing. Angered at their trick, he chases them to a snow castle they've built on a frozen pond.Unable to get inside, Donald constructs a battleship made of snow and ice. From there, he launches snowballs at the boys, along with some frozen snow missiles. The boys retaliate with some snow bombs filled with mousetraps. Using arrows with red-hot coals stuck on the tips, they melt the battleship, causing Donald to fall into the frozen water with a splash that instantly freezes. Donald himself is frozen on top of that frozen fountain, as the boys victoriously dance around him like Indians.
