4 young South Africans go on a camping trip to the white girl's family farm. When they wake up next day, they've magically switched bodies. Later, when they've switched back, they're interviewed documentary style.
A group of young friends on a camping trip, deep in the South African countryside wake up to discover they have all swapped bodies. Their individual cultural heritage and experience of these strange happenings couldn't be more different; and stranded in the wilderness, they will have to navigate a personal-political labyrinth if their friendship and their lives are ever to be the same again. The stage is set for comedy to turn to tragedy, for the fantasy of South Africa's "Rainbow Nation" to become a painful awakening.
