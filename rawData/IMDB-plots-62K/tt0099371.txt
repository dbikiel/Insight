A young hot-shot stock car driver gets his chance to compete at the top level.
Cole Trickle enters the high-pressure world of Nascar racing. He's a hot driver with a hot temper, and this attitude gets him into trouble not only with other drivers, but members of his own team as well.
Coming off a successful open wheels career, Cole Trickle is recruited by used car salesman Tim Daland to be his driver in the NASCAR Cup series. After proving his talent, he is paired with legendary former crew chief Harry Hogge. Through a tumultuous rookie debut and lack of team chemistry, Cole confides in Harry in order to find success in a sport he knows very little about.
