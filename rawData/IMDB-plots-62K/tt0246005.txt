A self-loving fictional autobiography of author Kari Hotakainen
Based on Kari Hotakainen's 1997 novel, the film's main character is a not very successful writer, Hotakainen, who is ordered by his publisher to write a dramatic novel about his own secret life. In search for "manic" inspiration, he becomes entangled in the world of cars, particularly a certain yellow Toyota and a used Alfa Romeo. As Hotakainen breaks ties with his former life and reality, he finds himself in opposition with Pera, the young white trash owner of the Toyota.
Author Kari Hotakainen is forced to write an autobiographical diary by his publisher, and to accomplish this, he tries to enter into a manic state somehow more conducive to writing. Hotakainen, played by Martti Suosalo, crosses paths with several caricatured people, and eventually starts committing crimes to make the headlines so his books will sell.
