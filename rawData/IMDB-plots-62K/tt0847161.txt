The Romanian count known as Dracula is summoned to London by Arthur Holmwood, a young Lord who is on the verge of being wed. Unknown to Arthur's future bride Lucy, her future husband is infected with syphilis and therefore cannot consummate their future marriage. Arthur has laid his hopes on being cured by the enigmatic count, as it is said that Dracula has extraordinary powers. However, these supernatural powers have sinister origins, since the Count is a vampire. Soon Arthur realizes his serious mistake as all hell breaks loose and the Count infects others with his ancient curse. Fortunately, Dracula has not counted on the young Lord acquiring the assistance of the Dutch Vampire expert. Prof. Abraham Van Helsing.
