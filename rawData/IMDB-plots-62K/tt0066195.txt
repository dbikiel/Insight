A stuffy author enters into an explosive relationship with his neighbor, a foul-mouthed, freewheeling prostitute.
Can a bickering odd couple in Manhattan become friends and maybe more? Owlish Felix is an unpublished writer who vents his frustration by reporting to the super that the woman in a neighboring flat takes the occasional payment for sex. She's Doris, more wildcat than pussycat, and when Felix's peeping-tom-tattle-tale routine gets her bounced from her apartment, she knocks at his door at 3 AM, aggressive and ticked off. They yell, lose another apartment, and pick up where they left off in a friend's flat and beyond. Dancing by the light of the moon seems unlikely for this owl and pussycat.
Mild mannered Felix Sherman is a struggling novelist who has to work as a bookstore clerk to make ends meet. Doris Wilgis is brash, in-your-face and uneducated prostitute. Although they have not met, they have an antagonistic relationship from afar as they live in the same New York City apartment building, his continual typing which bothers her, her professional work and her complaints about the typing which bother him. They do eventually meet when each is directly the reason why the other is evicted from the building in the middle of the night. Despite their continued antagonism after meeting, they spend time together if only because of their shared homelessness. Despite still being bothered by certain aspects of the other, especially those unfamiliar to their own sensibilities, they begin to have a mutual attraction based on their opposite personalities. He is attracted to her innate openness. She is attracted to his intellectualism. Can their budding relationship survive their differences, especially when it comes to their sexual history and Felix being already engaged?
