A documentary exploring the myth of the Loch Ness monster.
This is a mockumentary within a mockumentary. The ensemble cast is a Who's Who of modern filmmaking, from Werner Herzog, independent director (Nosferatu, Grizzly Man, Rescue Dawn) playing himself directing a documentary, to cinematographer Gabriel Beristain (of the Blade movies) playing himself, to Sound Recorder/Mixer extraordinaire Russell Williams II (of Independent Lens, Moesha, Training Day) playing himself, to.. well you get the idea. Throw in the legend of Nessie and you've got a totally hilarious thriller mockumentary directed by Zak Penn, Make sure you watch the commentary with the Director and cast members, which continues the fiction of the movie. It's brilliant.
The German film director Werner Herzog sets out to the Scottish Highlands to make a documentary, "Enigma of Loch Ness", exploding the myth of the Loch Ness Monster. Meanwhile, another documentary film crew is making a film about Werner Herzog, and we see the production of "Enigma" from their point of view. Shooting on a rented boat, tensions begin to rise as director Herzog and his producer, Zak Penn, find themselves at cross-purposes on the black surface of Loch Ness. Things get very edgy when the film crew starts seeing shapes in the murky water.
Werner Herzog decides to make a film at Loch Ness and assembles a diverse collection of experts to support him. The expedition does not go well and there are personal conflicts; the film that Werner ends up with is not the one he intended. However, he does find "Nessie" and comes up with an interesting adventure at Loch Ness after all. Two crew members actually " die".
