A teenage vigilante seeks revenge on a group of violent thugs who raped her handicapped sister and killed her best friend.
An altercation between a group of girls out for the night and a gang of local punks leaves the punks vowing revenge. It comes in the form of the gang-rape of a young mute (Heather) and her older sister (Brenda) starts hunting the gang in turn - armed with bear traps and crossbow.
Brenda is bad, bold and brash. But she absolutely dotes on her deaf-mute kid sister Heather. When a prank involving the trashing of a dope-dealing gang's car leads to the brutal rape of the innocent Heather by the gang, Brenda vows revenge, while fending off the romantic overtures of a dimwitted jock and the venomous remarks from his jealous girlfriend. In a riveting climax, Brenda ultimately delivers justice for her sister's stolen innocence.
