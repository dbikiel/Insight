A personal interpretation of Norwegian history - starring a grandmother who during the Second World War loses her job ironing the King's shirts. Instead she gains access to the enemy's uniforms, and inspires her own brand of resistance fighters, the "Shirt Guerillas".
A woman recounts the story of her grandmother, who ironed the shirts of King Haakon VII of Norway, the first monarch of the country when it gained its independence in 1905. The royal family sent their clothes to be pressed at a local clothing shop called Hoff, where the woman's grandmother would eventually come to work. She had no idea she was ironing the King's shirts until one day she noticed the royal monogram on the shirts, and followed the messenger who delivered the shirts back to the royal palace. After that, the woman mentioned at every opportunity that she ironed the King's shirts. She continued to do so up until the 1960's which ushered in the era of counter culture and the woman's retirement due to her distaste for the new clothing. But her job as the King's shirt ironer also took a bit of a break during WWII, when the King went into exile to fight the war from abroad. But that break did not stop the woman from making her own mark in the war effort through her ironing.
