Frederick Osborne, Junior is slightly agitated because his father, Senior, is acting more like a college student than the president of a huge merchantile fleet. Senior reveals that he is going to marry Leslie Collier, the famous stage star, and Junior and his wife Enid are horrified and expect the worse from the hot-tempered father and the volatile actress. They have been married only five minutes before they have a quarrel, and have to be carried out of the house to begin a sea-voyage honeymoon. Carlos, a penniless stowaway with a high opinion of his singing ability, is invited to stay with Senior and his bride when they return to New York, the idea that sponsoring Carlos' career will give Leslie the limelight she promised to fore-go when she married Senior. The routine of arranging Carlos' debut disrupts the Osborne home and Senior goes home to the children. To save Senior's marriage, Junior and Enid invite Carlos to stay in their home. Junior too soon stalks out. Senior and Junior's solution to save their marriages is to finance Carlos' career in the farthest-away place they can find, and still effect a reconciliation with the wives.
Staid shipping magnate Osborne Sr.'s life is transformed when he falls in love with actress Leslie Collier. (Much to the chagrin of his son and daughter-in-law, who wish that he would act his age.) But while on their honeymoon they discover a young singer, Carlos Bardez, stowed away on their yacht. Complications ensue as Leslie invites the handsome tenor to live with them until he is discovered. Father is not amused...
