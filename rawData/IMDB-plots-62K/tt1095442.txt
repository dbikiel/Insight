The film begins in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, with Solo (Souléymane Sy Savané), a Senegalese cab driver, who is working to provide a better life for his young family. William (Red West), an old man with a lifetime of regrets, hires Solo to take him to Blowing Rock, a peak in which updrafts cause objects that are dropped from it to fly upwards. William does not ask for a ride back from the rock and is obviously depressed, so Solo assumes that the old man intends to commit suicide there. Solo befriends William, in hopes of talking him out of ending his life. He introduces William to his girlfriend and her daughter, hoping to inspire the old man with the joys of life. It is not revealed whether William commits suicide or not. [D-Man2010]
