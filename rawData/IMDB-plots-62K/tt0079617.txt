Barcelona between the years 1917 and 1923. It is the time of the gun law, during which the confrontation between anarchist gunmen and hired assassins paid by the employers gave a scandalous number of deaths. The confrontation between the anarchist workers and the owners of the Savolta arms factory is aggravated when the Savolta family decides to end the rebellion by hiring hit-men and plotting intrigues in order to hide their illegal transactions with Germany.
