A young architect finds himself in a situation that he never had to deal with before--now that he is successful (and married), sexy young women are throwing themselves at him. He and his wife take separate vacations to follow their urges.
Consumed by lust, married architect and family man, Richard Moore, decides to go alone on a tropical vacation and let some steam off by bedding the local women. However, once there, his plans are constantly being foiled by various crazy situations. Meanwhile, his wife Sarah Moore takes their kids to a mountain resort for an actual vacation. However, she attracts the attention of a local ski instructor, who plans to bed her. Will the unfaithful spouses succumb to their lower urges and satisfy their lust or will they end up realizing that together they have a good thing going?
