They are tied with thread stained with tealeaves and a Nepalese bead.The film is one component of the international exhibition Ashes and Snow, an installation of photographic artworks, films and a novel in letters. The show travels in the Nomadic Museum, a temporary structure built to house the exhibition, and has visited Venice, New York, Santa Monica, Tokyo and Mexico City. To date, Ashes and Snow has attracted more than 10 million visitors, making it the most attended art exhibition in history. Ashes and Snow at the Nomadic Museum is next scheduled to open in Brazil in 2009.The title Ashes and Snow suggests beauty and renewal, while also referring to the literary component of the exhibition-a fictional account of a man who, over the course of a yearlong journey, composes 365 letters to his wife. The source of the title is revealed in the 365th letter. Colbert's photographs and this film loosely reference the traveler's encounters and experiences described in the letters, fragments of which comprise the narration in the film.
