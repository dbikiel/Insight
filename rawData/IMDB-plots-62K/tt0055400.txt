Two stories, both about three stupid guys who get screwed by their dog.
In a small log cabin in the forest, three friends - Coward, Dunce and Experienced - make moonshine for sale. Things are going well. After working, friends try an alcohol-containing product and, having decided to make a joke, throw sugar dipped in moonshine to the dog Barbos. The offended dog overturns bottles and containers with a potion, takes out a coil from the moonshine still and runs with it in its mouth from the house into the forest. Trinity chases the dog. In the end, they all resort to the police station, where the moonshiners are arrested.
