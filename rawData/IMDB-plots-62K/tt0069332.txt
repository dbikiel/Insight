Super Fly is a cocaine dealer who begins to realize that his life will soon end with either prison or his death. He decides to build an escape from the life by making his biggest deal yet, converting the coke to cash and running off to start a new life. The problem is that the Mob does not have a retirement plan and will give him a choice of staying and selling for them or dying if they find out his intentions.

Now he goes around trying to find someone who can provide him with it and someone offers but the only problem is the person who is providing him, expects him to go on dealing for him. So he makes plans to escape.
