A traveler stays the night at a rural inn, but gets no rest as he is tormented by various spectres and mysterious happenings. The food on the table prepares itself, his clothes leave the room on their own and the room seems to tumble end over end. Several hooded figures dance around his bed, and a demon finally tears away one wall and seizes him.
