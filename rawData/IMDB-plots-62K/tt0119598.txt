Josh is a high school guy who lives with adoptive parents and is involved in little crimes with his friends (including young lesbian Bella). Suddenly his elder brother Walter comes out of the blue (he left home 10 years ago when he was 18 and was never heard during these years). After that Walter starts to involve Josh in various new criminal activities, including robbery.
