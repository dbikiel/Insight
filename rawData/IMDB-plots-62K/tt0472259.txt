A quiet but disturbed young man puts the life of a woman he's obsessed with under a virtual microscope when he installs hidden cameras throughout her house.
Alone With Her is the harrowing story of a disturbed young man's attempts to win the affections of an unsuspecting young woman. When Doug (Colin Hanks) first sees Amy (Ana Claudia Talanc√≥n), he instantly falls for her and begins to watch her every move, going so far as to set up spy cameras in her apartment. However, as his fascination grows into obsession he's no longer satisfied with just watching.
Invasion of privacy and domestic spying take on terrifying meaning in this unsettling tale of voyeurism. A young man has a secret obsession for a beautiful woman. By planting hidden cameras and listening devices in her home, he learns her most intimate secrets in order to manipulate her into a relationship that she innocently permits. Shot entirely through hidden cameras, including a "body cam," Alone With Her takes the audience to an extreme level of voyeuristic intimacy, exploiting both our fear of being watched and our compulsion to watch.
