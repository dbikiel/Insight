Nearly twenty years after the events of "The Girl of Your Dreams", in the 1950s, Macarena Granada, who has become a Hollywood star, returns to Spain to film a blockbuster about Queen Isabella I of Castile.
We are immersed in the 1950s, as the film diva Macarena Granada returns from Hollywood to Spain to shoot a US blockbuster entitled The Queen of Spain, where she will breathe life into Isabella I of Castile. In Madrid, not only will she meet up again with her old friends and colleagues from the troupe but she will also have to contend with another dictatorial regime: that of Francisco Franco.
In a glaringly conspicuous attempt to disguise propaganda as art, and to improve the government's image, the Spanish dictator, Francisco Franco, opens the way for an ambitious American production about Queen Isabella I of Castile. Eighteen long years after the shooting of La ni√±a de tus ojos (1998), the now successful Hollywood star, Macarena Granada, returns to Spain along with many of her co-stars, and the seemingly long-dead director, Blas Fontiveros. However, can they replicate their past success?
