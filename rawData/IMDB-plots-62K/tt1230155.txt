Lindeman, 25-year-old art student, struggles to find his inspiration, finding himself in one ridiculous situation after the other.
Lindeman, a sculptor in his last semester of art school, is stuck. His final project - a two ton block of granite - stands front and center in his studio, an ominous reminder of the daunting task ahead. To begin working Lindeman needs to be inspired but the problem is: where do you look for inspiration? Lindeman tries the goth scene, the gay scene, the vegan scene. He tries falling in love, becoming one with mother nature, and passing himself off as an intellectual. He tries everything he can think of but, in the end, he might just realize he doesn't need to be somebody to be someone. Flying under the radar - being nobody - has its perks.
