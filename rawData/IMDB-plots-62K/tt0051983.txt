A priest in a poor community lives a charitable life in accordance with his religious principles, but many others do not return the favor.
Nazarin is a priest, attempting to living a pure and honest life strictly according to Christian principles - but others only show him distrust and hatred, apart from the local prostitute...
In a poor and backward community in Mexico, the Catholic Priest Nazario follows the Christian principles and lives a humble life without possessions in an old hostel owned by Chanfa and used by prostitutes. When the prostitute Andara kills her coworker Camilla that had stolen her buttons of shells, she is wounded and seeks shelter with the priest. Meanwhile, the disillusioned dweller of the hostel Beatriz is lured by her boyfriend Pinto and tries to commit suicide. However, Chanfa convinces her to return to her village. When the police discover that Andara is hidden in the room of Nazario, she flees and Nazario undresses his cassock and wanders in the poor countryside, helping the destitute and begging for food. When Nazario reaches a very poor village, he meets Beatriz that is living with Andara and asks him to help a child that is very ill. Nazario prays for the child and on the next morning she is healed. Andara and Beatriz believe he is a saint and become his followers. Along their journey, Nazario and Andara are arrested and the priest is humiliated and beaten by common people and by the church.
Robbed of his meagre personal belongings and jeered by a raucous team of prostitutes, the humble and pious apostolic priest, Father Nazario, takes in the feisty streetwalker, Andara, who seeks shelter from the police. With murder on her conscience and burdened with a troubled suicidal sister--the epileptic, Beatriz--Andara and her sister decide to follow the devout priest on his religious journey to help those in need, in turn-of-the-century Mexico. However, is the world ready for salvation?
