Emerenziano is the middle-aged tax inspector who is in search of a wealthy wife. He travels to northern Italy where he meets three sisters, who, though wealthy, are not by any stretch of the imagination young or beautiful. He decides to marry one of them and then takes the other two as mistresses. The virginal sisters are slowly transformed into man hungry mavens, each possessing their own individual sexual talents. It all seems to be work out fine for him until he meets a young waitress who he entangles himself with and as a result becomes a helpless prisoner subjected to the whims of the love starved females.
