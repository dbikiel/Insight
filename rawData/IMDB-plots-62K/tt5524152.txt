As winter comes, little Bear decides to eat all the snow around him, but soon falls ill.
Winter has come. The whole forest is covered with snow. The Bear was so happy that he ran and jumped through the snowdrifts. "Beauty!" He shouted. - "It is necessary to eat everything!" The Bullfinch told him: "Why did you lay down in the snow? You'll catch a cold. "" Nah, I would eat it all. All this beauty. And when I eat it, I can sleep afterwards. "- answered the Bear. And he was swimming in the snow, eating snow and counting snowflakes. And when he froze, he wandered home and crawled under the covers on the bed. The Bear was lying and it seemed to him that he was spinning all along with the snowflakes.
