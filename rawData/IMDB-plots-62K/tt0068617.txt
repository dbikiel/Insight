Police in Boston search for a mad bomber trying to extort money from the city.
Detectives Steve Carella, Meyer Meyer, and Bert Kling are part of the 87th Precinct's team investigating a murder-extortion racket run by a mysterious deaf man. While attempting to investigate and prevent the murders of several high-ranking city officials, they also must keep track of the perpetrators of a string of robberies. Further complicating matters is a rash of arson attacks on homeless men.
