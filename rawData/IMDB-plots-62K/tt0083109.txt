2 buddy farmers are visited by aliens who like their domestic cabbage soup.
Two old french countrymen are living a quiet life in their little old farms. The first one, Claude Ratinier, aka "le Glaude" (Louis de Funès), is a widower, and the second one, Francis Chérasse, aka "Cicisse" (Jean Carmet), is single. They spend their days drinking liters of wine and pastis, reminding themselves the good old times. One evening, they happen to start a farting contest, which seems to provoke a lightning storm... Then they go to sleep, but somebody has been quite interested by their kind of expression, and is preparing to change their life...
