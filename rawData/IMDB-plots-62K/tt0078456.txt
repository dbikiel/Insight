After her whole family was slaughtered under the order of the emperor, a pregnant martial artist is on the run, and struggles to avoid being caught or back-stabbed by even her closest friends.
While Ho Meng-hua didn't direct the like-titled sequel to his internationally popular Flying Guillotine, he did helm this exceptional follow-up, which stars the gorgeous Chen Ping as the fearless title character, who takes on an entire flying guillotine gang, despite the fact that she's pregnant!
