Two suburban couples experiment with sex, drugs and bohemia in early 1970's Los Angeles.
Barbi is a beautiful but blas√© suburban housewife whose handsome mate, Rick, is more interested in his career than in quenching his wife's sensual thirsts. When up-and-coming actor Mark and his open-minded wife, Sheila, move in next door, Barbi discovers they're more than willing to help her find the thrills she's been missing. Before long, Mark and Sheila part company, and when Rick finds out about Barbi's extramarital dalliances, he walks out on her. Free to do as she pleases, Barbi changes her name to Viva and teams up with Sheila to join the front lines of the sexual revolution, enjoying assignations with a dizzying variety of partners, including hipster artist Clyde, psychedelic naturalist Elmer, experimental theater advocate Arthur, glamorous lesbian model Agnes, and sexually ambiguous hair stylist Sherman. But will Viva's appetite for the ecstatic lead her into dangerous and unexpected places?
