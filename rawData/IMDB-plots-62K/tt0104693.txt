The lives of two incompetent young men from Brooklyn spin out of control after a friend returns from Florida with guns to sell.
Jimmy and Jon are a couple of Brooklyn guys who somehow never found their way into workaday society; they never found their way into big-time crime, either. But that all changes when their old friend Frankie returns from Florida with some guns to sell. In the course of a few very short urban summer days, their lives spin permanently out of control.
