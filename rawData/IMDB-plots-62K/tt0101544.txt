Paul and Kathy Plunk move away from Phoenix, Arizona, so that their baby daughter may grow up in the healthy Oregon. They buy a small motel in a lonesome mountain region... - it could be idyllic, but their first guests are the wanted criminals Knott and Frost, who are on flight from the police. They need money, so they assault the Plunks, force them to withdraw all their money from the bank. But the nightmare just begins: they take the Plunks and their baby with them as hostages. Their life is worth nothing to the psychopathic criminals.
