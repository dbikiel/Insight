Billy Blazes confronts Crooked Charley, who has been ruling the town of Peaceful Vale through fear and violence.
In the Old West, there is general lawlessness in the Prairie mining town of Peaceful Vale in Rattlefire County due to the ineffectiveness of Sheriff "Gun Shy" Gallagher. This allows outlaws like Panther Pete to run roughshod over anyone, and Crooked Charley, a gambler, to do the same. Crooked Charley is threatening to evict Old Pierre, who along with his daughters - the current being Nell - have operated the Five-Ace Tavern for years, the eviction due to back rent owed. Things in Peaceful Vale have the potential to change with the arrival of the unknown solider of fortune, Billy Blazes, Esq. In addition to challenging anyone who opposes him, Billy ends up focusing on saving Nell, the two who fall for each other.
The mining town of Peaceful Vale is a rough place, and sheriff 'Gun Shy' Gallagher can do little about it, since the town is ruled by Crooked Charley, the gambler. Charley runs Pierre the tavern keeper out of town, and takes Pierre's daughter Nell as his prisoner. But when Billy Blazes sees Charley's henchmen harassing Pierre, he rescues Pierre and then proceeds to confront Charley back at the tavern.
