A girl is among the few survivors of a dystopian Earth. Riding a war tank, she fights against the tyranny of a mega-corporation that dominates the remaining potable water supply of the planet.
Tank Girl (Rebecca) and her friends are the only remaining citizens living in the wasteland that is Earth, where all the remaining water is controlled by Water and Power, the mega corporation/government that runs the territory. While incarcerated at W + P, Tank Girl and her new friend Jet Girl break out and steal... a tank and a jet. After meeting some mutant kangaroo/humans, and rescuing her little girl (adopted by her friends), the kangaroos and the girls kick Water and Powers' butt.
The plot revolves around the fact that Tank Girl and her rebel group are attacked by Water &amp; Power, a powerful force that controls the remaining water on a dystopian Earth, led by Kesslee. A young girl named Sam is abducted and the story revolves around TG's quest to save her and seek vengeance against those who killed her crew with the help of Jet Girl, the rippers and Booga, who has a noticeably different personality than in the comics.
Unlike the strip's non-linear, stream of consciousness, absurdist cut-and-paste sort of structure, the film has a standard timeline. The plot revolves around the fact that Tank Girl and her rebel group are attacked by Water &amp; Power, a powerful force that controls the remaining water on a dystopian Earth, led by Kesslee (Malcolm McDowell). A young girl named Sam (TG's boyfriend's daughter, as it's revealed in The Making of... book) is abducted and the story revolves around TG's quest to save her and seek vengeance against those who killed her crew with the help of Jet Girl (Naomi Watts), Sub Girl (Ann Cusack), the rippers and Booga (Jeff Kober), who has a noticeably different personality than in the comics.
