Jack and Judy are husband and wife, and Howard is Judys father. They live in some fictional undemocratic and repressive country, and tell us a story about their lives, mostly from Jack's point of view.
The story is told in a series of monologues, shifting from one character to the next. The tone of the piece is conversational and direct, giving the audience the feel that they are listening to these characters at a dinner party. The subject matter is at times somber and melancholy; but in the hands of Nichols, who is charming and engaging, an endearing, world-weary humor finds its way into the material which becomes both entertaining and poignant as we slowly realize the fate of their small social group of intellectuals, who are first watched by the the government; and then later imprisoned (presumably for their political views). By observation the audience realizes that the complacency and comfort this group of educated prominent citizens feel about their place in society has been an illusion, as their political freedom slowly slips from their grasp, as the government becomes more onerous and suspicious. Finally, we learn the significance of the title; and the theme of the play resonates with the audience as we find ourselves considering our own social group within the mass of all human society; ultimately we realize the transient nature of all cultural, religious, and ethnic identity over extended periods of time; and with the passing of each generation the last surviving individual of a group bears the responsibility to grieve and mark the passing into oblivion of his tribe, whether it be religious, ethnic, intellectual, artistic or political. At the conclusion of this thought -provoking play I found myself thinking of the Soviets in Russia, or Castro's Cuba, or the European Socialists or Marxists, the Mayan civilization, or the great Apache warriors of the American west, all of whom recede quietly into the great oblivion of human history.
