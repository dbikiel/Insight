A man has everything: dozens of servants, a palace, vast woods, gardens, a lake, mechanical toys, private entertainment troupes of musicians and dancers. He has it all - but love. When alone, he sits at a desk, sighing, and looking at a photograph of a pretty girl. One day, the circus descended onto his palace, and amidst all the fun it brought, he recognized the Amazon on the white horse - the girl in the photograph. The girl is now the mother of a small boy, Yo-Yo, whom she considers that looks like the millionaire, even under a clown's make-up. The boy will spend some time in the palace, in awe of so much riches, but he will leave (in a dream-like scene) on the tusks of the elephant. Time passes - and one day Yo-Yo will be the owner of his father's palace in decay. Starting from scratch, he will rebuilt it, and be praised as a great clown, an artist, a film-maker, a millionaire. Yet, something is amiss...
This story begins in 1925. A wealthy man can have anything he wants as witnessed by what he asks his mansion-full of servants to do for and with him. But he's not totally satisfied in his life as he longs for the only woman he's ever loved, a woman named Elle, her whereabouts of which he has no idea. One day, he notices a traveling circus passing by. As a man who loves to be entertained, he follows the circus and finds Elle among its troupe, and the son he never knew he had. After the 1929 stock market crash, the man loses his vast fortune, and thus is free to join the circus with Elle. He dotes upon his son, who they nickname Yo Yo, as the yo-yo is perhaps the man's favorite toy. Under his father's tutelage, Yo Yo grows up to be an accomplished circus clown and magician. As Yo Yo grows into adulthood, he longs to restore his father's mansion to its former glory. Through WWII and the advent of television which changes the entertainment landscape, can he accomplish such working as a circus clown?
