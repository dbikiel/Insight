The Little Tramp and his dog companion struggle to survive in the inner city.
Poor Charlie lives in a vacant lot. He tries to get a job but when he gets to the head of the employment line the jobs are gone. Back "home" he rescues Scraps, a bitch being attacked by other strays. Together they manage to steal some sausages from a lunch wagon. They enter a dance hall where Edna is a singer and unwilling companion to the clientele. He is thrown out when he can't pay. Back "home" Scraps digs up a money-filled wallet buried by crooks. They return to the dance hall to find Edna fired. The wallet goes back and forth between Charlie and the crooks. Charlie, Edna and Scraps end up very happily.
Charlie is awakened from his outdoor sleeping quarters by the tantalizing odor of steaming viands offered for sale by a passing hot-dog vendor. This leads to a number of spirited adventures with the police, who resent Charlie's ambition to eat without paying the usual fee. Later, Charlie's faithful dog, famishing for something to test his teeth upon, digs up a pocketbook "loaded" with money that crooks buried in the ground. And when Charlie tries to spend the money in a nearby caf√© he meets the big moment of his career, for it brings him into contact with a beautiful cabaret singer who is herself starved for love and kindness.
