Part documentary, part expose, this film follows one-time child evangelist Marjoe Gortner on the "church tent" Revivalist circuit, commenting on the showmanship of Evangelism and "the religion business", prior to the start of "televangelism".
In this revealing documentary, Southern evangelist Marjoe Gortner allows the filmmakers to record him swindling people out of money. Raised to be a child preacher on the revival-tent circuit, Gortner made a small fortune for his parents. Later, he began preaching on his own in a lively, rock star-influenced style, but, since he lacked actual religious faith, money became his sole motivator. As he stages his final revival tour, Marjoe provides a rare glimpse inside the business of evangelism.
