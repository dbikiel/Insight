The passion and anger of a modern warrior during the height of the AIDS epidemic.
Larry Kramer in Love and Anger is a feature-length documentary about the legendary author, activist and playwright, Larry Kramer. It is an in-depth 'warts and all' portrait of one of the most important and controversial figures in contemporary gay America, a political firebrand who gave voice to the outrage and grief that inspired a generation of gay men and lesbians to fight for their lives. He's a complicated man, who, at 78, still commands our attention.
