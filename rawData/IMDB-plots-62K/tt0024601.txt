When Stan and Ollie trick their wives into thinking that they are taking a medicinal cruise while they're actually going to a convention, the wives find out the truth the hard way.
So that he and Stan can sneak away to Chicago and attend the annual "Sons of the Desert" lodge convention, Ollie pretends to be sick, and gets a doctor (who turns out to be a veterinarian) to prescribe a long ocean voyage to Hawaii. Decked out in leis and strumming ukeleles, they return home only to learn that the ship supposedly carrying them has sunk. Their hastily- contrived tale of "ship-hiking" their way back cuts no ice with their wives, who've been at the movies watching a newsreel of the lodge's convention parade, starring... guess who?
After the Exalted Ruler gets all local lodge members to swear they will attend the Sons of the Desert's annual convention in Chicago, Stan and Ollie have to find a way to to get their wives to let them go. Stan has surprisingly little trouble doing so but for Ollie, it's a formidable task. In the end he fakes an illness getting a doctor (actually a veterinarian) to order him to take a cruise to Hawaii. So off the boys go to Chicago - and the plan would have worked brilliantly were it not for the fact that the ship they were to sail on sinks and the wives happen to see them in a newsreel.
