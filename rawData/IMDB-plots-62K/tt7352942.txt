The Humorist is a film about a week in the life of Boris Arkadiev, a fictional Soviet stand-up comedian. Boris is tormented not only by external oppression and censorship but also by his own insecurities that poison all his relationships.
The year is 1984, and Boris Arkadiev, a fictional Soviet stand-up comedian, is unraveling under the weight of fame, censorship, KGB "patronage," and his own insecurities. Finally, the comedian snaps and - armed with the exotic American notion of "insult humor" - takes his revenge.
