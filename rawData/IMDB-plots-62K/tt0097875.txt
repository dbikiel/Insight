In a deserted industrial area on the edge of town, somewhere in Eastern Europe, there is a bathtub standing in the middle of an empty workshop. Eckermann, the meteorologist is having a bath in it. He spends most of his time daydreaming which earned him the nickname Little Cloud with his friends. He's got two friends: Berlioz, the restless hedonist and Vero, the strong and silent tough guy of the factories. The industrial area is going to be demolished very soon. The military unit controlling the industrial site orders everyone to evacuate the area which is being closed down - the guys need to move out.
