A British East India Trading Company assassin seeks to redeem his past by thwarting a plot against a young nation's hope for freedom.
The chief mercenary for the British East India Company, being double crossed by his former employer, has made his way to the American Colonies. Working to redeem his name, William Reynolds (Andrew Cheney) now hides behind a different mask in hopes of thwarting his former employer. As his past life closes in on him, Will must somehow gain the trust and the help of his beloved Charlotte, a woman he has been lying to, as well as a colonial intellectual by the name of Ben Franklin. All the while he races against time to defuse a plot that could have devastating effect on the birth of a new nation.
The film follows William Reynolds, a former assassin for the British East India Company. He attempts to "retire" from the East India Company and as a result his Boss, Charles Kemp, tries to have him killed because he knows too much. He flees, taking the name and job of a vicar who died saving Will's life. Will attempts to settle into the quiet life of a vicar (with a surprising degree of success) and falls in love with Charlotte Holloway. An old associate happens upon the quiet town and confronts Will, who kills the man and buries him under the cover of darkness. Later, he asks Charlotte to marry him and she agrees, provided he passes her uncle's approval. At Thanksgiving, Charlotte's uncle arrives and is revealed to be Charles Kemp, who reveals William's identity to Charlotte and tries (again) to kill him. Will flees once more, and, yet again, his rescuer dies saving Will's life. Again using the identity of his rescuer (Jeremiah Flack), William travels to the colony of Pennsylvania and finds a job in Benjamin Franklin's printing shop after passing Franklin's 'test of faith' and revealing that his sympathies lay with the revolutionary cause..
