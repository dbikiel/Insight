Edna's father wants her to marry wealthy Count He-Ha. Charlie, Edna's true love, impersonates the Count at dinner, but the real Count shows up and Charlie is thrown out. Later on Charlie and Edna are chased by her father, The Count, and three policeman. The pursuers drive off a pier.
Count de Ha Ha aspires to the hand of an heiress and $1,000,000. The father of the beauteous lady pays over the million and tries to deliver the daughter. She, however, has a mind of her own. She drops a note from her balcony, begging to be saved from the cruel fate. Charles Chaplin picks up the note and at once enters the house and announces he is the Count de Ha Ha. He gets a royal welcome. While dining at the house, however, the real count appears. His former negotiations had been carried on by correspondence, but he proves to the satisfaction of the millionaire that he is IT. In the ensuing battle Chaplin kicks both the count and the irate parent out of the house and flees with the girl. They find a jitney automobile, and after dropping a nickel in the slot are off, the count, the cruel parent and several policemen in pursuit in another machine. There is a wild race across all kinds of roads, through woods and across small creeks, in which the autos run both backwards and forwards, colliding many times. Chaplin loads his auto with bricks and when the pursuers are too close bombards them. He knocks the policemen out into the mud puddle. Finally there is a terrific collision and the pursuers' machine is knocked across a dock and plunges several feet into a river, submerging the count and the irate father. Then the happy pair kiss and race for a parson.
