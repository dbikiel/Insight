When the titular antagonist of an action-adventure video game takes on physical form, it's only the game's less powerful protagonist who can save his creator's family.
Following his son's suggestion, Shekhar designs an action-adventure video game where the antagonist is more powerful than the protagonist. The player has to fight in the first two levels to reach the third one where whoever fires the bullet first wins. The game is well-received on its opening night, but things go wrong when Prateek stops playing and quits the game in between, only to invite the wrath of Ra.One, the game's villain who uses an advanced technology to take on physical form. He wants to destroy Prateek, something only the game's protagonist, G.One, can prevent from happening.
A father is his child's best superhero. Shekhar, after facing criticism from his son, tries to make him feel happy by creating a game in which the villain is comparatively more powerful than the hero. This is what his son exactly wants. Shekhar even gives his face to the game's hero, G.One. He however keeps on ignoring the issues in the game, but knows little that the game would turn out to be deadly. Ra.One, the villain, using a device invented by Shekhar's friend and colleague, Jenny, comes out of the game and starts to search for Lucifer, who is none other than Prateek. The lives of everyone turn upside down, when one small imagination turns out to be something that can't be imagined. As of now, it's the responsibility of the game's hero, G.One, to protect the family, not only from the torment of Ra.One, but also from the very danger of being captured by him.
