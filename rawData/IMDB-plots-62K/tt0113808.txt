Gwyn Marcus has always wanted a marriage like her parents. She has just accepted the proposal of her boyfriend Matt, but she has misgivings about their future together. Her fear of commitment grows as she learns of the various affairs that her family is having. With her sister getting married and her brother already married, her mother is growing concerned about Gwyn's being the last single person in the family. But the more she thinks about marriage, the more she must search for the balance between career, marriage and family.
When her long-term boyfriend causually asks her to marry him, our heroine realises she is pretty ambivalent about the whole business. In one way she very much wants to marry him, but looking around at her family she wonders if there's any real point. Her married brother is having an affair with his best friend's wife, while her sister is playing around almost before her wedding's over. But the biggest shock comes when she finds out both her parents are straying. What is a girl to do?
