In Madrid, an American engineer unwittingly gets involved in a scheme to smuggle priceless religious artifacts out of Spain.
In Madrid, American bridge engineer Jerry Parker is about to board a plane for his flight back home to the USA when the Spanish police detains him at the airport. They search his luggage and find a priceless religious artifact that had been stolen from a Spanish monastery ten days before. The Spanish police inspector interviewing Parker is convinced of his innocence and explains to the shocked American that some criminal probably tried to use him as a courier to smuggle the object out of Spain. The object could fetch a million dollars on the black market. Nevertheless, despite Parker's innocence, the Spanish police ask for his help in locating the criminal who attempted the smuggling trick. Parker refuses to get involved since he's in a hurry to return home for his upcoming wedding in four days time. Desperate for his help, the police inspector claims there are some irregularities with Parker's passport and it could take a few weeks to clarify the issue. Sensing the blackmail trick, Parker agrees to help the Spanish police locate the smuggler as long as he can leave Spain in four days, in time for his wedding back home. The police agrees to this bargain and return Parker to his hotel, providing him with the stolen artifact in case the real thief shows up. During the following days, Parker, the Spanish police, a beauty pageant manager and the real thief try to outwit one another in an attempt to achieve their aim. Parker and the cops want to catch the real smuggler whereas the smuggler and the beauty contest manager want to take possession of the artifact. In the process, Parker will face dangers but also enjoy some wild good times with the beauty contest models staying at the same hotel. Some people will get murdered and the hotel general manager will almost lose his sanity due to the stressful events taking place at his establishment.
