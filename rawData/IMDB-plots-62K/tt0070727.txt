The sleazy and dangerous adventures of a gorgeous female private detective.
Blonde, fast, and extremely lethal, Stacey Hanson, the curvaceous private eye and seasoned race-car driver, is commissioned by the affluent Florence Chambers to investigate her family's close members who inhabit her mansion. To be included in the will, nephew, John, the stunning brunette, Tish, and Florence's grand-niece, Pamela, must all be worthy of the Chambers' name; however, as Stacey starts digging deep, the suspicions will be justified. Can they keep their skeletons in the closet?
