Sebastian Mamani returns to his Aymara community from which he was expelled long ago. He is carrying the great mask of death, he must dance until he died, in a kind of atonement for the sins that caused his exile and as a way to be reborn in his lost cultural identity.
Sebasti√°n Mamani, a farmer of Aymara origin, who had been expelled from his community, returns to dance until he dies. The peasant community has condemned him to exile under threat of death if he returns to appear. During the time he has lived in the city, he has been confronted with the harsh reality of having to live isolated from his social group. In the city of La Paz he was discriminated against because of his skin color and his condition as an Indian. By understanding that their individual existence only makes sense in living with others, they try to claim and achieve integration even at the cost of their sacrifice.
