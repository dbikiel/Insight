A darkly humorous look at the lives and loves of four modern women, each with their own remarkable, intriguing and often tragic story.
Leith, Edinburgh. Rhona, an ex-fashion model who's mourning the death of her fiancé, plans revenge on her fiancé's killer while falling into drug dependency. Kelly is battling with her demons and managing to upset all those around her. Shaz works in an old people's home and takes on her job very seriously -- selling black-market Viagra to the residents. Amanda is the bride-to-be and matriarch of the gang. She's a successful business woman with her own beauty salon and is due to marry Joshua, an airline pilot with a very dark secret.
