A seemingly meaningless journey of an old man and an EMT specialist in an ambulance becomes unexpectedly meaningful for both of them.
Kailasam was once a fearless god of a man. At the age of 55 he can't complain. Life is good His only son refuses to speak to him. Asset-wise, a long list of diseases, a big house in ruins and a box full of Orange candies. He knows that Orange candies are bad for his chronic diabetes. But what is the point of living, if we have to deprive ourselves of even the smallest pleasures? He likes laughing in the face of death. But death doesn't seem to be interested in him. When he gets really bored, he dials the free emergency ambulance service and gets a ride to the hospital in the nearest town and back home again. The 3 hour-journey is his baby's day out. Enter Satya,a paramedic. He is in mourning. His difficult father has just died and Satya is full of remorse for not having had the chance to make peace with him. When he meets the old man Kailasam, he has to ask himself why the stubborn old troublemaker has come into his life, the old rogue who reminds him of his father, of all people. Has the universe sent him this impossible old man for a reason? Is Satya being tested somehow? The old man needs to find a hospital that will have him, but it's a very long way to go. The only way to find out what the universe has planned is to make the journey. Sometimes the Journey is the destination..
The lives of Sathya, who works as an Emergency medical technician (EMT) on the State sponsored 108 Ambulance and Arumugam, who functions as its driver, get rudely interrupted by a snobby old man, Kailasam. The film captures the travails of both as they becomes progressively irritated by Kailasam's words &amp; actions.
