After fleeing Europe for Uruguay during WWII, Jacob Kaplan built a quiet life. Now 76, he begins to question his worth. After learning of a mysterious German prowling the shores of a nearby beach, he becomes convinced that he's found a Nazi in hiding and plans to expose him. Expertly distilling a potent mixture of emotional depth and deadpan comedy, Mr. Kaplan is a vivacious meditation on family, aging, and the drive for significance.
At 76, Mr. Kaplan has a severe existential crisis. As he begins to question his worth, he comes across the strange case when his grand-daughter mentions about a German man who runs a caf√© near the beach. Convinced that he has found an escaped "Nazi", Mr.Kaplan, himself a Jew who fled from the Nazis as a child, teams up with the expelled cop, Contreras, who incidentally turns out to be a slacker, to kidnap the German &amp; take him to justice.
