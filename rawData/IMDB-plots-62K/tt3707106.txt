A couple tries to repair their marriage while staying at a hotel in France.
Set in France during the mid-1970s, Vanessa, a former dancer, and her husband Roland, an American writer, travel the country together. They seem to be growing apart, but when they linger in one quiet, seaside town they begin to draw close to some of its more vibrant inhabitants, such as a local bar/caf√©-keeper and a hotel owner.
Roland and Vanessa, an unhappily married couple traveling through France, stay at a hotel by the sea. Roland, a failing writer, sits at the bar all day drinking while working on his book. Vanessa suffers from mental illness and spends most of her time in their room. When they are together, they argue frequently. A pair of newlyweds are staying in the room next to theirs. Roland and Vanessa start to spy on them through a hole in the wall, and Vanessa becomes obsessed with their lives.
