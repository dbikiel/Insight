To remedy his financial problems, a travel agent has his eye on a frozen corpse, which just happens to be sought after by two hitmen.
In the middle of Alaska, travel agent Paul Barnell is near bankruptcy. Desperate to help himself and his beloved, mentally ill wife Margaret, Paul discovers a dead body and passes it off as his missing brother Raymond, whose life is insured for up to $1,000,000. Everybody is duped, except for workaholic insurance investigator Ted Waters, who sets out to expose Paul, in hopes of being promoted out of Alaska. Meanwhile, two rookie hit men, Gary and Jimbo, discover Paul took 'their' body and kidnap Margaret, demanding the body back. Then, Raymond turns up alive, wanting in on the action...
A black comedy centered on Paul Barnell, a down on his luck Alaska travel agent who's on the brink of bankruptcy and whose beloved wife, Margaret, is on the brink of insanity. So what's a nice guy with good intentions but bad business sense to do? The answer lies frozen in a dumpster outside of Barnell Great Escapes-a dead body Paul hopes to pass off as his long-lost brother Raymond and then collect on the life insurance. Unfortunately, investigator Ted Watters who's anxious to transfer back to the lower 48 with his girlfriend, isn't about to let Barnell walk away with a million bucks. Adding to Paul's avalanche of problems are two aspiring hit men-turned-kidnappers and the stunning return of the supposedly dead Raymond, who now has an ax to grind with his brother. Desperation is running high in the "big white," and if Paul is smart, he'll blow the snow, take the money and run...to South America.
