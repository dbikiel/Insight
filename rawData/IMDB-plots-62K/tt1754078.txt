Reluctantly, a dour long-distance truck driver agrees to give a lift to a Paraguayan single mother and her five-month-old daughter to Buenos Aires. Can the palpable silence soften up the taciturn trucker's sullen heart?
Rubén is a lonely truck driver who has been taking the motorway from Asunción, Paraguay to Buenos Aires, Argentina for years, carrying wood. However, today's journey is different because of Jacinta, who accompanies him as his passenger all the way to Buenos Aires. What's more, Rubén finds out at the very moment that her little Anahí, who's 8 months old, travels with them. As kilometres go by, the relationship between Rubén and Jacinta will grow. They will slowly sip into each other's soul. None of them talks much about their lives. None asks much either. It's a few word journey but it is not a silent one.
Rubén, an Argentinian middle-aged long-distance truck driver who hauls lumber from Paraguay to Buenos Aires for many years, reluctantly agrees to give a lift to his unexpected passenger, the Paraguayan single mother, Jacinta, and her five-month-old daughter, Anahí. Gradually, before the endless stretches of road and the monotonous hum of the engine, the taciturn trucker will come out of his shell, drawn out by Jacinta's adorable baby, and a timid, yet profound hope to heal the shielded emotional wounds. Can the palpable silence soften up Rubén's sullen heart?
