An acerbic relationship comedy about a young married couple that draws together the sad truths about the difficulties of intimate relationships.
It seems just OK. Your car is nice and your wife even nicer, and you test video games for a living. Then something hits you right between the eyes. You stand up, ready to fight. But fight whom really? Your wife? Her celebrity chef lover? Or your very own life made of innocent lies, tiny delusions and jokes that have ceased to be funny? Pull yourself together, Kamper.
