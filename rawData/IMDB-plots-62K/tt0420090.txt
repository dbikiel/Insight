A Palestinian family is trapped inside a house commandeered by Israeli soldiers.
A Palestinian family with five children lives outside town, near Israeli settlements. Samia, the wife, wants to leave; so does one teen son. Mohammad, the patriarch, is adamant that he is staying. Two of his adolescent children want to fight. His is the passive aggression of non-violent witness. Israeli soldiers burst into the home, taking over the second floor. At night, the family is locked in the living room. We see the effects of the occupation on the children and on the marriage. Through the eyes of Miriam, the older daughter, we watch the soldiers from her hiding place. Jamal, the eldest son, sets a trap with a grenade. Characters call upon Allah. Chaos and death are close.
In the South of Palestine, the idealistic Professor Mohammad is a family man that, with his wife and five children, lives a simple life in an isolated house. His wife Samia wants to leave Palestine but her husband refuses to emigrate to another country and become a refugee. One night, Israeli soldiers commanded by the paranoid Commander Ofer break in their house and the peaceful Mohammad needs to control his family that wants to react against the Israeli aggression.
