The classic Charles Dickens tale of an orphan boy who escapes the horrors of the orphanage only to be taken in by a band of thieves and pickpockets.
When his mother dies after childbirth, a poor orphaned boy named Oliver Twist (Richard Charles) is taken in Mr. Bumble's (Timothy West's) squalid workhouse to work his fingers to the bone. However, finding it impossible to cope with this cruel and inhumane way of living, the nine-year-old fugitive seeks shelter in the home of the Jewish moneylender and leader of a London gang of young pickpockets, Fagin (George C. Scott), only to reluctantly learn the tricks of the trade. Now, the ruthless thug, Bill Sikes (Tim Curry), has a new lucrative job in mind about the wealthy Mr. Brownlow's (Sir Michael Hordern's) expensive silverware, and he needs the innocent Oliver to carry out a difficult and dangerous task. Is this the beginning of Oliver's criminal life?
