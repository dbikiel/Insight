A small Maryland town is gripped by a curse which causes residents to take their own life one after another.
In a small Maryland town, the suicide of an outcast teenager triggers a string of violent suicides. These suicides seem to stem from a curse which spreads when any person, who witnesses the suicide, is possessed by an evil force that appears as the person's doppelganger that only they can see. A young teenager, named Lindsey, thinks there is a connection of the events to Aidan, the outcast brother of the first suicide case. But Lindsay must race against the clock when she witnesses her mother fall victim, and must try to find a way to stop the curse before it kills her too. Meanwhile the God-fearing townspeople, led by a fanatic preacher with a connection to the events also, form a vigilante group to take the law in their own hands.
A rash of suicides has devastated the small community of Grovetown, with fear and panic spreading among the local residents. As those around 18-year-old Lindsay continue to die grisly deaths, she begins to distrust everyone... and she suspects she may be the next victim.
