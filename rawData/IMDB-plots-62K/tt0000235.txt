A devil conjures up a dancing woman from a mystical flame.
A devil wearing bat-like wings and brandishing a trident dances around a giant pot, conjuring forth flame from his trident to lit a fire beneath the pot. After the devil works the fire with bellows, an angelic woman emerges from the pot. The devil and the pot vanish as the woman performs a dance, waving about her diaphanous sleeves until she conjures forth another fire, then she rises amongst the smoke into the air.
In yet another hand-tinted depiction of Hell by the French filmmaking wizard, Georges Méliès, two dreadful petrified gargoyles guard inferno's fiercely hot chamber of furnace, when all of a sudden, a hideous green-as-emerald devil appears, carrying a needle-sharp trident. Dancing and stoking the fire pit's scarlet flames, the lesser demon finally conjures up a young woman in a pure white robe, who, without delay, begins to perform a lively Serpentine Dance to rekindle the dying embers. Wilder and wilder, the blaze of purgatory keeps growing stronger until the female entity is eventually engulfed in flames. Is this the end?
