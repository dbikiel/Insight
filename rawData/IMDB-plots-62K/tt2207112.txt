When the police tell her that Elodie, her only daughter, aged 20, has left for Syria to wage jihad, Elisabeth's life is turned upside down.

Alone in her struggle, Elisabeth decides to go to Syria to look for her daughter and persuade her to come back with her to Belgium. Will mother and daughter succeed in finding and understanding one another?
