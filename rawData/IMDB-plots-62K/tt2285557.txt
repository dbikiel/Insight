About the scientific expedition of the group of explorers sent off to Lapland ( northern Sweden) by King Louis Philippe I of France in the years 1838-1839. The guide of the expedition was Lars Levi Laestadius, a vicar, who complemented the research work of the French explorers in Lapland by providing his own scientific materials. For this valuable co-operation, King Louis Philippe I rewarded Laestadius with the insignia cross of the French Legion of Honour.
