When New York Police Headquarters is confronted with the horror of a serial murderer loose on the streets of Manhattan. Oblivious to the danger, a group of hip students from all over the world, who now attend school together in New York, are planning a memorial to celebrate the lives of their lost "brothers and sisters" who died suddenly in a tragic plane crash a year prior. Aspiring actress EVE, her athletic boyfriend SEBASTIAN, bad boy gone good DOMINIC, tough but sweet JOAN, hip hop mogul on the rise, VALENTINE and beautiful, carefree MARIA, soon begin to turn up dead, one by one. As more dead bodies mount, detectives JOSEPH and MICHAEL are in a race against time to stop the serial killing. The crime scenes and the way each victim was killed lead the detectives to theorize that each of the killings may be linked to the victims' ancient namesakes. Those namesakes are known to be some of the most saintly people that have graced the earth. As evidence continues to mount and more body bags are gathered, the detectives are convinced that the killer is basing his crimes on the belief that every generation has 36 righteous individuals who live among us, where, with all of them gone, the world would fall into chaos, corruption and eventual darkness. The hunt is on to find the last of the 36 Saints before the killer does.
