Welcome to the bizarre universe of the friki.
Javier Cardenas and his group of frikis (Spanish translation of 'freaks') invade the city with their screwballs helped by people so bizarre like Pozi, Carmen de Mairena and very much. Cardenas ridicules to everyone with his jokes to the Jackass' style. Pure surrealist delirium that to everybody will make laugh. Frikism to the power!.
