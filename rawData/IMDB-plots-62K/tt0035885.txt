An anthology of three loosely connected occult tales, with ironic and romantic twists.
Two clubmen discuss the occult, introducing three weird tales: 1) Plain, bitter Henrietta secretly loves law student Michael. Then on Mardi Gras night, a mysterious stranger gives her a mask of beauty that she must return at midnight. 2) At a party, palmist Podgers makes uncannily accurate predictions, later telling skeptic Marshal Tyler that he will murder someone. The notion obsesses Tyler, with ironic consequences. 3) High wire artist Gaspar dreams of falling, then loses his nerve. He recognizes Joan from his dreams, and falls for her. Will any of his dreams, involving Joan and disaster, come true?
Three speculative stories dealing with the supernatural. In the first, an ugly woman wears a beautiful mask for a night to win a man who never noticed her before. In the next, a wealthy and content man is told by a fortune teller with a very good track record that he will murder someone. Then, a daredevil tight-rope walker is haunted by a dream of falling during his act, and also the woman who appears in that dream.
