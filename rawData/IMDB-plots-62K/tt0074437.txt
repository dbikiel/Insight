A mid-19th century mulatto slave is torn between his success as a pit-fighter and the injustices of white society.
Drum has been born to a white prostitute Marianna, who raises him with her black lesbian lover Rachel. He grows up to be a fighter and is often forced to bare-knuckle-box other slaves for the entertainment of the owners, one of whom is a gay Frenchman named Bernard. Bernard wants to sleep with Drum, but Drum rejects him and Bernard vows revenge against him. Drum and his friend Blaise are eventually sold to plantation owner, Hammond and are both taken to his plantation to work. Regine is purchased by Hammond as well and is taken to the plantation for his own personal desires as a bedwench. After arriving at Hammond's plantation, Regine is set up in the bedroom above Hammond. Augusta, Hammond's fianc√© is jealous and has other plans for Regine. Hammond's daughter Sophie wants to sleep with Drum, but he won't for fear of being killed. Sophie also attempts to sleep with Blaise and after being rejected, tells her father that Blaise has raped her, which is a lie. Blaise is put in chains and Hammond decides that he must be castrated for the alleged rape. Meanwhile, a dinner party has been arranged to celebrate the engagement of Hammond and Augusta. Bernard has been invited to attend the celebration and the guests end up discussing the best way to castrate a slave at the dinner party. While the party is taking place, Drum frees Blaise from his chains and there ends up being a violent uprising from the slaves at the engagement party. Bernard shoots Blaise during the fighting and Drum in turn grabs hold of Bernard's privates and rips them off. Both slaves and slavers are killed during the battle, but Hammond and Augusta are all saved by Drum.
