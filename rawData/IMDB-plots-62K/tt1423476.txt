Dweezil Zappa has led an extended and industrious rockin teenage combo dedicated to re-acquainting the world with the sights and sounds of his father, Frank. They revive Franks music in a fresh context that is -- above all else -- true to the elder Zappas unique and impeccable sonic heritage. The junior Zappas guitar craft is at once like his fathers, and yet hes mature enough to have already developed his own signature touch. ZPZ travels with a fairly substantial ensemble. Joining Dweezil are core constituents Joe Travers, Pete Griffin, Jamie Kime, Aaron Arntz, Scheila Gonzalez, and Billy Hulting. Another of Dweezils primary tethers to his father's legacy are the artists who at one time or another passed through the 60s, 70s, or 80s bands that Frank fronted.
