When construction worker Greg becomes fed-up with his foreman and the "city life", he takes his wife and kids on a wilderness adventure.
Greg Van Waspish, feeling that there's more to life than spending day after day working in the city, decides one day to pack up the family and move out to the wilderness. The family, not having been consulted in this move, takes to their new life very reluctantly, but eventually get used to life in the great outdoors. This film also includes parody previews to three non-existant movies.
