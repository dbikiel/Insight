A town at the edge of the missing take desperate measures to avoid it.
In this screwball and charming comedy, the story starts in an unspecified point of Spain's geography named Fuentejuela de Arriba, a so small mountain town with a so big problem: a population of 16 people, all them aged, without young ones nor children. Campello's, Fuentejuela de Abajo's mayor, appears to make a warning: if the population lows to 15 or less for the incoming census of the region, Fuentejuela de Arriba will disappear to be annexed to Fuentejuela de Abajo as an only one town, for desperation of their inhabitants denied to see the town as part of Fuentejuela de Abajo due to their eternal rivalry. Teresa, wife of Fuentejuela de Arriba's mayor, finds an impossible solution to the trouble: after she meets Azquil, Shukra, Latisha and Calulu, four Africans on the run wanted by the police who were cheated to job as exotic dancers in a close brothel, Teresa decides use them to increase the population and save the town, specially after to learn about the death of Alfonso, Manolita's husband and their only one councilor. Therefore, bad news never come alone: villagers mistrust about the Africans, taking them as thieves and criminals, and Teresa discovers that her husband betrayed her not with another woman as she thought but announcing him in the incoming elections as Fuentejuela de Abajo's vice-mayor for working at the service of Campello in a plan to turn Fuentejuela de Arriba in a touristic resort after the annexation. With no options, Teresa asks help her friends Jaime and Guiri to integrate the Africans in the town: it causes that Teresa feels interested about Azquil, that Guiri interests about Latisha for Shukra's jealousy (her ex boyfriend), that the own Shukra and Jaime's aging mother Encarnita starts a relation of hate and mistrust, and that Calulu interests about Jaime, hoping that he comes out of the closet. A true mess that it will explode when Campello and the rest of Fuentejuela de Abajo visit to their rivals for Fuentejuela de Arriba's local feasts, with unpredictable consequences for everybody.
