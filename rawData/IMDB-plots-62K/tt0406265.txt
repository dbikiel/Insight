A drama set in the 1920s, where free-spirited Janie Crawford's search for happiness leads her through several different marriages, challenging the morals of her small town. Based on the novel by Zora Neale Hurston.
Sassy Janie Starks looks unlike to get anywhere in pre-Great War Easton, Florida, but lands the best colored catch, lively shopkeeper Joe Starks, who even becomes town mayor. However her refusal to oblige his expectations of decency turn love into bitterness. After his death, she prefers to enjoy 'freedom' again, with cocky outsider 'Tea Cake' as playmate, and not just at chess. They even face the risks of seasonal labor.
Based on the classic by Harlem Renaissance author Zora Neale Hurston, the film depicts the timeless, lyrical and passionate story of a beautiful and resilient woman's quest for love, sensual excitement and spiritual fulfillment, despite society's expectations of a woman of color in 1920s America. Ms. Berry stars as Janie Crawford, whose journey takes her through three marriages with very different men, and during which she experiences all that life has to offer, from tremendous success to unspeakable heartbreak. Darnell Martin directs from the teleplay written by Suzan-Lori Parks, the first African-American woman playwright to win the Pulitzer Prize. Michael Ealy, Tony Award winner Ruben Santiago-Hudson and Emmy Award winner Ruby Dee also star, with a strong supporting ensemble cast.
