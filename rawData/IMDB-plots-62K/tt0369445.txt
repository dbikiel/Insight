Sent on a quest to rescue a princess, four clueless players must guide their characters through dangerous forests, ancient ruins, and past the girl next door.
One late night in a college dorm, four socially inept geeks immerse themselves in a fantasy world of their own creation. As their characters journey through forbidden kingdoms, ancient ruins, and the forsaken wilderness, the players attempt to solve a mysterious puzzle that could ultimately mean the difference between getting a life and death. Who is The Shadow? Where is The Princess hidden? Will any of them ever find a date? And how long do they have before their annoyed neighbors call the cops?
This is the story about a group of gamers as they play a role-playing game. At the same time, it follows their characters through the fantasy world they inhabit, as they attempt to reach the lair of "The Shadow" and defeat him. The scenes flip between the gamers in their dorm and their characters in the fantasy world (played by the same actors who play their gamer counterparts). The movie makes fun of both gamer stereotypes and the absurdity of many RPG rules and traditions. The game is frequently interrupted by a girl who lives down the hallway, telling them to be quiet.
