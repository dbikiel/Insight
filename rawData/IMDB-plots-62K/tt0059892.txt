A young boxer Andrzej Leszczyc not only has to face a tough boxing opponent but needs to make some serious personal and professional choices.
Andrzej has left the army, and appears to drift around the country participating in boxing fights. In an industrial town, he runs into Teresa, a government engineer, who has arrived to implement a new project at a factory. Andrzej wins in a local boxing match, but decides to leave with Teresa instead of facing a much stronger opponent the next day.
