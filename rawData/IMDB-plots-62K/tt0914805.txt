A film edited from the home movies of serial killers Wayne and Andrea Montgomery, which presents a look into their quiet, suburban lives...and the graphic, disturbing details of their horrific crimes.
Wayne Montgomery was Delaware's most prolific serial killer. From 1986-1989, he was responsible for the deaths of countless people, while maintaining a quiet suburban life with his wife Andrea. In 1989, he took an extended hiatus from his work to settle down and help raise a family. In 2006, Wayne decided to come out of retirement to continue his life's work, with Andrea now joining him in his craft. The grisly details of Wayne and Andrea's horrific crimes were captured by Wayne's video camera, a sick, twisted way to relive the experience again and again. Hundreds of hours of shocking footage shot over a period of several months have been edited into a feature length film, with cooperation from the victims' families. This footage is now being presented as the feature film HEAD CASE. From award-winning filmmaker Anthony Spadaccini.
