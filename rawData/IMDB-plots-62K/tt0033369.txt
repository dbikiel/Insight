The Younger brothers, Cole (Dennis Morgan), Bob (Wayne Morris) and Jim (Arthur Kennedy), return to Missouri after the Civil War with intent to avenge the misdeeds of William Merrick (Victor Jory), a crooked banker who has been buying up warrants on back-taxes and dispossessing the farmers. Henry Younger (Russell Simpson), their father, has been killed by a Merrick henchman and, then, Cole is framed on a murder rap. The brothers escape and then begin a series of bank and train robberies, primarily stealing from Merrick and turning the loot over to the farmers. Jim, in love with Mary Hathaway (Jane Wyman), is lured into Harrisonville and jailed. Cole and Bob ride to rescue him.
