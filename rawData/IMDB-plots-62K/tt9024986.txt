Besieged Leningrad. In the suburban house of the Resurrection, living "in a special position," six people and a chicken that no one can cook is gathered. Previously, the cook was engaged in this, but she was taken away from Voskresenskys on the eve - hard times came outside, and the situation was not easy inside either: the younger son brought a hungry girl, the eldest daughter was an unfamiliar man, whom she was going to marry. Just a few minutes left before the New Year, and the number of problems grows like a snowball.
