Unsettling drama about three generations of Italian-American women struggling to get by in post-World War II New York's Little Italy.
Two short films tell the stories of a mother and her daughter at key points in their formative years. While the mother, as a young girl, had to contend with marrying an undesirable boy from the wrong side of the tracks and her obsessively Catholic mother, her daughter, at the same age, puts herself through a series of torturous rites of passage so that she may grow up to be cannonized as a saint.
