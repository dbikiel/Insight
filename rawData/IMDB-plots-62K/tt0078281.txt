A young Judean boy tries to sell his beloved old donkey to someone who would care for him as much as he does.
A young boy must part with his beloved donkey, named "Small One". When he takes him into town to sell him, the only person who wants to buy him is the tanner. When all hope seems lost in finding a kind master, Small One leads his master back to the tanner's shop where he is willing to sacrifice his life. A miracle happens, and he is bought by Joseph to carry Mary to Bethlehem.
