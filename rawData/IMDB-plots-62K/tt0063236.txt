Five lonesome cowboys get all hot &amp; bothered at home en the range after confronting Ramona Alvarez and her nurse.
In the wild wild west, Ramona Alvarez and her perpetually stoned nurse run into five gay cowboys. The seven members of the party desire a handsome male drifter, except for the transvestite sheriff, who can't be bothered about anything but his outfit. All hot &amp; bothered at this point, the cowboys rape Ramona, who subsequently has sex with the drifter and, in the afterglow of sex, wants to form a suicide pact with him. The drifter rejects her new desire and rides off into the sunset with another man.
