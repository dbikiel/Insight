A romantic and funny coming-of-age story. Victor, a 13-year-old boy, is desperately looking for his First Kiss. When that First Kiss comes too close, Victor seeks refuge in his imagination, becoming the Man of Steel who has no emotions, because tears will make him rust. But no Man of Steel can resist Fania, a 13-year-old girl, for very long.
