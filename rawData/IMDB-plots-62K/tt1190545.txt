A young girl moves to a village populated by anthropomorphic animals.
This is the story of a young self-reliant girl called Ai, who one day, moves into the Animal Village. While working at Tom Nook's shop "Nook's Cranny" she begins living her life away from her family. To begin with, she doesn't know left from right, but under the guidance of Mayor Tortimer, the angry but correct Mr. Resetti, and the wandering musician K.K. Slider among others, she is eventually accepted as a member of the village. One night as she walked along the beach, she finds a message in the bottle. It sets her off on a quest of planting pine trees around the village to fulfill a miracle on the eve of the Winter Festival.
A cheerful, self-reliant young girl named Ai begins a new life in an idyllic woodland village, and learns valuable life lessons about dreams and friendship from its eccentric animal inhabitants.
