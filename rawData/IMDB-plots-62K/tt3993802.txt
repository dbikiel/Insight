A meteorite brings ice and freezing temperatures, which threatens to harm the residents of a small town at Christmas.
A meteor enters the Earth's atmosphere and splits in two pieces. One piece strikes the center of a small mountain town and immediately starts to freeze everything and everyone nearby. The second piece forms a tropical zone amongst the snow and ice. A university grad student and a local man struggle to join the two pieces of the meteorite back together to save the town and mankind.
