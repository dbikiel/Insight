A dying Sheikh travels across the Moroccan Atlas in a caravan escorted by two rogues.
A caravan escorts an elderly and dying Sheikh through the Moroccan Atlas. His last wish is to be buried with his close ones. But death does not wait. The caravaners, fearful of the mountain, refuse to continue transporting the corpse. Sa√Ød and Ahmed, two rogues traveling with the caravan, say they know the way and promise to take the corpse to its destiny. In another world, Shakib is chosen to travel to the mountains with a mission: to help the improvised caravaners.
In the High Atlas Mountains at an indeterminate time in the past, a caravan of travelers searches for a pass that will allow them to return an ailing elderly Sufi master to his home to die. Among the party is Ahmed, a rascal and a survivor, who is willing to do whatever it takes to rise up from his miserable condition. Ahmed is particularly inspired by the Sufi master and his wife and, upon the old mans death, he becomes aware of his own innate abilities and takes up the leadership of the caravan. On his journey, he receives the assistance of Shakib, a young man sent on a mission from a special place in contemporary Morocco.
