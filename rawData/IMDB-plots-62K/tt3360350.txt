A woman trapped in a loveless marriage finds herself falling for a divorcee.
Two people who had been married to different partners once before. Anushree Pradhan and her two daughters live with her mother-in-law, her husband, Kedar, having abandoned them. He now lives in the same city, but in a different house, with another woman. He has not once looked back at the life he left behind in four years. Anu has not yet signed the divorce papers that he sent her way, with the hope at the back of her mind that he might still return. She is living her lonely life with only this vague hope serving as a phantasm of light at the end of the tunnel. Rohit Phadnis is a successful doctor, a renowned surgeon. He is father to Ashlesha and Shaunak. His ex-wife, Pradnya, lives in the U.S. When she had to choose between her house and her career, she took the tough decision of pursuing her career. She has adamantly refused to let their mutually consented divorce have any effect on the friendship that she has shared with Rohit. However, she is unable to see the scar that it has left on Rohit's life. He too, is damaged and alone. Anu's and Rohit's kids attend the same school. A sports injury suffered by Anu's elder daughter serves as a pretext for them to meet, and it blossoms into a new sort of bond for the both of them.
