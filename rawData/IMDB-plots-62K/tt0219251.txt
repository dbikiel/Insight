"Plasticine Crow", a re-telling of the old Aesop fable about the Fox and the Crow.
The legendary animated film "Plasticine Crow" is known to everyone with its absurd and sometimes surreal, but always funny stories. The film itself is conventionally divided into three independent parts, each of which tells its own story. In the first the authors introduce the viewer with the genres of painting on the example of children's drawings. The story is accompanied by funny poems and songs.
