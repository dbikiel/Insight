The story of the making of this remarkable album is told here via exclusive interviews, archive footage and performance, with contributions from producer Bob Rock, band members James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett, and Jason Newsted. We revisit the original multi-tracks of the album, as well as listen to previously unheard demo recordings. Featuring the five singles from the album, Enter Sandman, Sad But True, The Unforgiven, Wherever I May Roam and Nothing Else Matters, this is the compelling story of one of the biggest selling albums of all time, a true Classic Album.
