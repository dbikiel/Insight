A substance-addicted actress tries to look on the bright side even as she is forced to move back in with her mother to avoid unemployment.
Substance-addicted Hollywood actress Suzanne Vale is on the skids. After a spell at a detox center her film company insists, as a condition of continuing to employ her, that she live with her mother, Doris Mann, who was once a star and now a champion drinker. Such a set-up is bad news for her as she has struggled for years to get out of Doris' shadow, who still treats her like a child. Despite these problems and further ones involving the men in in her life, she can begin to see the funny side of her situation, and it also starts to occur to her that not only do daughters have mothers, mothers do too.
Suzanne Vale is an actress with a drug problem. One day she overdoses and ends up in the hospital and then rehab. After coming out of rehab she manages to land a role in a small-budget movie. The producers insist that she live with her mother, Doris Mann, for the duration of the movie, to ensure her sobriety. Doris is hardly the best role model.
