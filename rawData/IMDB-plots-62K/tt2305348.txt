Vulgar Fractions ostensibly begins as a physical exploration of seven unique state intersections along Nebraska, but eventually reveals itself as more concerned with attempting to uncover an underlying metaphysical construction that feeds ideas of both real and imaginary borders. In this examination, interrelationships are considered dialectically--land/sky, bordered/borderless, old/new tech--while moments of stasis are shown as being sublated by entropy. Vulgar Fractions was shot entirely single frame with a digital camera and an intervalometer. Sound is composed from field recordings taken on location. Additional samples of farm machinery taken by Seth Chrisman, Jon Rhodig and Scott Thompson. Made with the kind support of the Kimmel Harding Nelson Center for the Arts.
