On the verge of coming of age. Aimie is perhaps 18, a Korean immigrant in Canada. It's winter, snow crunches beneath her feet. She lives with her mother. She studies English and doesn't seem to be a particularly good student. Tran is her best friend, and he wouldn't mind if their relationship becomes sexual. She declines, then worries that he might find a more willing girlfriend. Her mother broaches the subject of remarriage. Aimie misses her father, sending him messages to come and visit. What does she have she can count on?
