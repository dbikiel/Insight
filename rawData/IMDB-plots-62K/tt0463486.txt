A magistrate investigates a corporate executive.
A character study. Jeanne Charmant-Killman is an investigative magistrate, tough minded, swift moving, taking on a group of political fixers who pay bribes and skim large sums for personal use. She breaks them one at a time. Meanwhile, her work takes its toll: relations with her husband are strained, and the group under investigation strikes back by tampering with the brakes of her car and placing a mole in her office. Can she stand up to the pressure, and what's her reward?
In Paris, the obstinate and tough judge Jeanne Charmant-Killman investigates a corrupt and powerful corporation that is embezzling public funds and its president Michel Humeau is arrested and sent to prison. She uses the hearing to collect evidences against the board and lobbyists, and sends one by one to prison. Meanwhile the group sabotages the brakes and the steering wheel of her car forcing her to have the protection of two bodyguards. Then they use a promotion to try to persuade her to stop her work, moving her to a bigger office expecting competition and friction with the also competent and honest judge Eryka but they become close friends focusing the same objective. Meanwhile her personal life is affected and she breaks off with her husband. When her husband apparently jumps off his apartment, Jeanne has to come up with a decision.
