The lives of a street preacher, an aspiring actress, a Mormon missionary, and a young gang banger intersect in this ensemble drama set in present-day Santa Monica, California.
Although Elder Farrell and Elder Lozano are assigned together as Mormon missionary companions they are a study in contrasts. Farrell, from Utah, is bookish, sensitive, focused on seeking potential converts, and dedicated to following mission rules. Elder Lozano was shot by a rival gang when being initiated into the Latino gang of his brothers and then was converted to the LDS church while recovering at the same time as a missionary in the hospital. Due to go home in three weeks, he shows more interest in playing basketball than teaching people. One day while going door to door in Venice, California they find themselves caught in crossfire as a Latino gang does a drive-by shooting. Lozano renders aid to Carl, an African American gang member who is seriously wounded. Upon recovery, Carl thanks him and becomes interested in learning about what the missionary has to teach about redemption. Returning home, the elders find an ill man lying on the street and take him back to their apartment. He is Louis, a homeless man who preaches from a Bible on the beach just below their window. Leaving the next day for an appointment to teach Carl, they ask their pretty next door neighbor Holly, an actress, to look in upon Louis. As Carl seeks baptism to alter his life's course, Holly and Louis tell of past deeds that have exiled them from family and friends. Elder Lozano finds missionary zeal through his encounter with Carl as Elder Farrell starts to struggle with an attraction to Holly that is not in keeping with the missionary rules he zealously has supported.
