Happy Singh lives in Jassi Villa with his wife, Jassi, and a young son. He has rented his rooms to Tom, who is deaf; and Harry who is dumb. When the twosome are unable to pay the rent, his wife asks Deepak alias Dick, who is blind, to join the duo and share the rent. When Dick arrives, the three find out about an attractive girl next door, Celina, and each does his best to make her his sweetheart. In the midst of Sushmita Sen, Aishwarya Rai, and Priyanka Chopra being crowned beauty queens in international contests, international criminal don, Soprano, has taken it upon himself to abduct young girls and sell them overseas. The lives of our three friends falls apart when Celina is abducted by Soprano and the three must band together to free her, little knowing that they will soon be pitted against Bollywood's most dreaded criminals, Shakaal (Saan); Gabbar Singh (Sholay); and Mogamba (Mr. India) in addition to the indestructible Soprano and his men.
Three men namely: Tom (Jaiyant - deaf), Dick (Naren - blind), and Harry (Debraj - dumb or mute). They live together as paying guests, and their life takes an endearing turn when a beautiful girl Celina comes to live in the bungalow opposite their house. They start making their moves to cast an impression on Celina, who is least interested in acknowledging their presence. Where as in Tom's life there's Bijlee, a fisherwoman, who is completely besotted by Tom, and does not leave any stone unturned to express her desire. On the other hand there is Suprano, a bad man, who is out to prove that he is the worst villain ever. Tom, Dick &amp; Harry unknowingly become the target of Suprano, by being the biggest barrier in his business deals.
