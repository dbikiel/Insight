The surveyor Giuseppe Di Noi experiments the troubles of the Italian Justice System of the '70s while back in Italy for a vacation.
Giuseppe Di Noi, an Italian land surveyor who has lived in Sweden for the past seven years, goes to his native country with his Swedish wife and children for his holidays. At the border he is however jailed for no apparent reason. He thus begins a nightmarish kafkian experience while he's moved from one prison to another, subject to any humiliation and violence.
