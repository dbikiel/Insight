Alice Moffit, 'Poker Alice', has been disowned by her Boston family because of her incurable penchant for gambling. She is travelling the West with her cousin, John, when she wins a house in a poker game on a train. The 'house' turns out to be a bordello, which she decides to run until she can sell it. She falls for a bounty hunter, Jeremy Collins, who is about to settle down in California. Marrying him would mean ending the life-long relationship between the two cousins.
