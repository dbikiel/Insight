The true story of how a seal named Andre befriended a little girl and her family, circa 1962.
Toni Whitney and her family adopt a baby sea lion. When it grows and starts getting into mischief, it antagonizes some of the fisherman in the town. One of the fisherman, Billy Baker, is upset with the Whitney's because Toni's father, Harry, was appointed Harbor Master instead of him, partially because of the seal. But when the humorous antics of the sea lion attracts media attention, further squeezing out Mark, and running down his business, he gets even more upset.
