24 hours in the life of three street youths in Montevideo.
The story is about three young boys, Leche, Javi and Seba, of Montevideo trying to survive to the Sunday. They have lots of problems involving studies, girls, and the only thing that they do is drink, sleep or find strange people like a crazy delivery boy, a retarded, a drug addict and a philosophical video renter.
