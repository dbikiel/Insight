Scoundrels must go to heaven ,and the only way for them to redeem their soul is to die after they "gave " their money to those in strained circumstances.
Madame De Loudéville is a benefactress,always ready to give millions to the needy ,from the TB patients to the poor black children from Africa.All the city council sings her praise ,calls her a saint and is to erect a statue of her. And yet ,she only owns a brewery and her beer is called "Trois Etoiles". Madame De Loudéville has strict morals:scoundrels must go to heaven ,and the only way for them to redeem their soul is to die after they "gave " their money to those in strained circumstances.So the chic lady helps them to die by murdering them with a little help of her henchman whom she knows is in love with her - Her other victims were too:nine in total so far...They are buried in her garden .
