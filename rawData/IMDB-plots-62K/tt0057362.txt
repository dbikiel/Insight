Fictional narrative of Hindu militant activist Nathuram Godse's plan to kill Mahatma Gandhi and of police officer Gopal Das' task to find the killer before it's too late.
"Nine hours to Rama" depicts the life of Nathuram Godse the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi. How Godse planned the assassination is shown in the film. How he became a Hindu activist who (unfairly) blamed Gandhi for the killings of thousands of Hindus by Muslims is revealed in a series of flashbacks.
