While staying at a secluded mansion, six young adults reveal their personal demons during an innocent game called Taboo. They reunite a year later, only to realize that one of them wants them dead for their moral transgressions.
When Christian Turner gathers together his fianc√©e Elizabeth and their friends Adam, Benjamin, Piper and Katie to celebrate their high-school graduation, they play the cheeky card game 'taboo' which anonymously confides their secret vices to paper. The following year Christian inherits the grand estate and invites them back for New Year's Eve. This time the games are far more serious, but go way weirder then anyone planned, with several unexpected twists.
