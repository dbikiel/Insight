Junior wants to be a Big Fry, but learns the hard way that he just isn't ready for smoking in the pool room when he should be in the school room.
Junior Catfish skipped school to hang out at the pool hall. Mama was worried he might have been caught by a fisherman instead. He returns home for dinner, then sneaks back to the pool hall for the meeting of the Big Fry Club. For his initiation, he's sent into a cave full of scary things that ultimately send him running back to mama's arms. Throughout, the title song is sung.
