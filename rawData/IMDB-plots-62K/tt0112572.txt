The original '70s T.V. family is now placed in the 1990s, where they're even more square and out of place than ever.
Mike Brady and his wife Carol Brady have just only one week to come up with $20,000 in back taxes or their house is sold and they'll have no choice but to move. And it's up to the Brady kids to secretly raise money and save the homestead before they lose their house to their scheming neighbor Mr. Larry Dittmeyer.
Picks up the Brady clan and plops them down in the 1990s, with their original naivete intact. Mr. Dittmeyer, the Brady's next door neighbor, is in charge of acquiring land for a new residential mini-mall, and the Bradys are the last hold-outs on selling their land. Unbeknownst to the Bradys, Dittmeyer has also been receiving, and concealing, their mail, which includes overdue notices on property taxes. $20,000 is necessary to save the Brady house from auction, and when the kids find out, they secretly go about raising money to save the homestead.
It's the 90's and even the Bradys get the blues. Mike and Carol have just one week to come up with $20,000 before their house is sold to their scheming neighbor Larry Dittmeyer. To make matters worse, Marcia gets a swollen nose on prom night, Cindy is addicted to tattling, and Jan is hearing a psychotic inner voice crying, "Marcia, Marcia, Marcia!"
