A soon-to-be husband wakes up on the morning after his bachelor party in bed with another woman.
When he wakes up the morning after his bachelor party in bed with a strange woman, a man presumes he must have cheated on his fianc√©e. Guilt leads him to try to cover it up in the week before the wedding, high jinks ensue.
Karen Cooper (Selma Blair) and Paul Coleman (Jason Lee) are about to be married. However, after his bachelor party Paul wakes up next to Becky Jackson, (Julia Stiles) a dancer at the party. Assuming they slept together Paul rushes Becky out of his apartment and hopes never to see her again. He tries to cover up the connection for the few weeks before the wedding. Unfortunately, this is impossible because Becky unexpectedly shows up around town and she turns out to be Karen's cousin. Even worse Becky's cop ex-boyfriend, with his "steroid rage problem", as she calls it in the movie, had Becky followed and photographed. Becky and Paul have to meet again to solve this problem. Further problems arise with a family and friends consistently showing up at the wrong times. Crabs, dirty underwear in the toilet tank, a horny best friend and a best man/brother that it is in love with the bride all provide for a comical week of wedding preparations.
