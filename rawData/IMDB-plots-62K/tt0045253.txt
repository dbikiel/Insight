In an effort to keep homesteaders off the open ranges near his and his sister Peg's ranch, young Kenny Masters hires crooked saloon owner Regan to steal their claims. As the settlers' wagonmaster is ambushed and robbed, and the town marshal is killed, Kenny gets cold feet as good-guy trail guide Tim Holt and his partner Chito suspect him of the wrongdoings.
Tim Holt (Tim Holt) and Chito Rafferty (Richard Martin) guide a wagon train to Silver Speings, where the homesteaders get a cold welcome from the area cattle ranchers. When the wagonmaster is shot and the homestead claims and money are stolen, Tim and Chito remain on the job to catch guilty people. It soon becomes apparent that Kenny Masters (Robert Sherwood) is behind the wrong doings because there are valuable oil deposits on the land, and he wants to get control of it. He seeks the help of the saloon owner, Regan (Frank Wilcox), and his henchmen, but soon Kenny loses control of the scheme to Regan.
