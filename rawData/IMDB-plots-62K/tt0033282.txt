Daffy Duck convinces Porky Pig to quit the cartoon biz and try his luck in the features. Porky's adventures begin when he tries to enter the studio.
Daffy Duck convinces an unwilling Porky Pig to quit his job with Leon Schlesinger. Why be a cartoon actor, Daffy says, when you can be leading man opposite Bette Davis? Schlesinger lets Porky go, but he is confident Porky will be back. Porky's adventures begin when he tries to get past the guard at the studio gate. He manages it by disguising himself as Oliver Hardy, but he has more trouble ahead. Meanwhile, Daffy tries to convince Schlesinger that he should take over Porky's starring roles. Daffy's scheme backfires when Porky returns to get his old job back.
Daffy talks Porky into breaking his contract with Leon Schlesinger so he can get into the big time: features. While Porky is away getting into trouble at the studio, Daffy tries to ingratiate himself with an unimpressed Leon. Porky returns in time to hear Daffy bad-mouthing him, and invites him out into the hall for a little "talk."
