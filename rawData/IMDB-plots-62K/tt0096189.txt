England, 1904. A young lawyer from London, Mr. Ashton and his best friend are hiking across Dartmoor. As he twisted his ankle, Ashton is forced to seek help at a nearby farmhouse and stay there for a few days. Innocent beauty Megan David catches the attention of Ashton. He decides to stay longer, and he and Megan fall in love, much to the displeasure of Megan's aunt and her loutish son. Before Ashton leaves the farm, he vows to return and take Megan away with him.
