Stripped of possessions and rights, German and Eastern European Jews flee to an unlikely destination to avoid persecution from the Nazis.
A gentle loving accounting of 20,000 mostly German Jews who were able to escape the Nazi's before World War II started and go to Shanghai, China, where the Japanese were in control of that city. Once Pearl Harbor occurred, the Jews, along with the Brits and other 'whites', were once again considered 'the enemy.'This documentary affirms that humanity is precious and we must share the past, painful as it is, to avoid its repetition.
