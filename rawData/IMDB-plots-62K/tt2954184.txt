Filmmaker David Bond invites parents everywhere to help their kids re-connect with nature in our digital age.
David Bond is concerned. His kids' waking hours are dominated by a cacophony of marketing, and a screen dependence threatening to turn them into glassy-eyed zombies. Like city kids everywhere, they spend way too much time indoors - not like it was back in his day. He decides it's time to get back to nature - literally. In an attempt to compete with the brands, which take up a third of his daughter's life, Bond appoints himself Marketing Director for Nature. Like any self-respecting salesman, he sets about developing a campaign and a logo. With the help of a number of bemused professionals, he is soon selling Nature to British families. His humorous journey unearths some painful truths about modern family life. His product is free, plentiful and has proven benefits - but is Nature past its sell-by date?
Filmmaker DAVID BOND becomes the Marketing Director for Nature. Too much time indoors makes children fat, depressed and out of control, yet children go out less and less. Can David market the outdoors - a free, wonder-product - to apathetic consumers, and to his own family? Or is it too late to sell Nature?
