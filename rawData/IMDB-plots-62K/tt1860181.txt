After being reacquainted with a childhood friend Stebbi joins the drug trade world in order to pay off his debt. Inspired by actual events.
In the mid to late 90's, the Reykjavik crime and drug scene saw a drastic change from a relatively small and innocent world into a much more aggressive and violent one.. The film tells the story of this change through the fictional gang of pushers that took control of Iceland's underworld.
Inspired by actual events. On the eve of the millennium, Stebbi, a student is arrested in a drunken brawl and reacquaints himself with a childhood friend, Toti, to help him find representation at his upcoming court date. In order to pay his debt he agrees to join Toti's crew. As he is drawn into the world of Iceland's drug trade he becomes the drug lord's right hand pusher, rolling in cash, drugs and girls. But that all changes as the demands of his occupation start to interfere with the inner drug trading circle's protocol and complications arise when he breaks those rules.
