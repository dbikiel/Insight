In a precursor to Trading Places (1983), the Bowery Boys are enrolled in a fancy college by a pair of rich snobs who think they can turn the Boys into classy guys. Sach becomes a football star, and is kidnapped by gangsters to keep him out of the big game.
Two wealthy club-men, Billingsley and Stanhope, want to test a theory that their old school Ivy, can make blue bloods out of Bowery toughs. They didn't come any tougher and unpolished than the Bowery Boys and they are soon enrolled at Old Ivy. Biff Wallace, the college football hero, and Harold, editor of the school paper, are determined to keep the hallowed halls pure, and Katie Wayne, Penny, Candy Calin and other students, are more than a bit dismayed to find the likes of Slip and Sach,Whitey, Chuck, and Butch attending Old Ivy. Sach mixes up some vitamins that make him invincible as an athlete in all sports. Soon, the football team, thanks to Sach and no thanks to former BMC (Big Man on Campus)Biff, is undefeated and unbeatable. Biff is unhappy about this and he approaches Big Dave and his sexy girlfriend Candy with a proposition. Candy vamps Sach just before THE BIG GAME with STATE, lures him to Big Dave's place, and Dave knocks Sach out with dope. The questions now are will Biff confess so Sach can be rescued, will Sach be rescued and, if Sach is rescued, can he get to the game on time to win it for Old Ivy.
