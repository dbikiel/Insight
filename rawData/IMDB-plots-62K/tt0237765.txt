Sonic the Hedgehog and his sidekicks Tails and Knuckles the Echidna are determined to thwart a plan that would turn their Land of the Sky into the equivalent of The Land of Darkness, which lurks beneath the surface (and is obviously the former planet Earth). So they plow through to the center of the planet and the ancient city of Robotropolis (the former New York City?) to do righteous battle. The big question of the day is whether the usually evil Dr. Robotnik is telling the truth for once or sending the good guys into a trap.
The brave blue hero is back! And this time, it's more than just fun and games. That's right, Sonic the Hedgehog is starring in his own motion picture, filled with all the fast-paced energy and action-packed excitement that Sonic's famous for! Dig this: Sonic's arch nemesis Dr. Robotnik has been banished from the Land of Darkness by an evil Metal Robotnik. And if that wasn't bad enough, the devious doctor tells Sonic that the Robot Generator has been sabotaged and will blow Planet Freedom to kingdom come. But what could possibly make Sonic trust his worst enemy? What could make him risk life and paw? Surely not the words of Dr. Robotnik. Not even the pleas of the President. It's not until the President's beautiful daughter Sara turns on the charm that Sonic springs into action. But does Sara really have eyes for Sonic, or is she sweet on the new kid on the block, the never-before-seen Hyper Metal Sonic?
When the nefarious Doctor Robotnik turns up in the Land of the Sky, pleading to world-renowned hero Sonic the Hedgehog for help, Sonic is skeptical. Begrudgingly, he accepts Robotnik's mission to travel deep into the Land of Darkness, where Sonic discovers that trusting Robotnik is always a bad idea. Now Sonic, and his friends, Tails the Fox and Knuckles the Echidna, must face off against the mad Doctor's latest and most dangerous robotic creation.
