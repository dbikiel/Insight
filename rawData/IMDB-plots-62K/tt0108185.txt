A farmer returns home from the Civil War, but his wife begins to suspect that the man is an impostor.
Set in the south of the United States just after the Civil War, Laurel Sommersby is just managing to work the farm without her husband Jack, believed killed in the Civil War. By all accounts, Jack Sommersby was not a pleasant man, thus when he returns, Laurel has mixed emotions. It appears that Jack has changed a great deal, leading some people to believe that this is not actually Jack but an impostor. Laurel herself is unsure, but willing to take the man into her home, and perhaps later into her heart...
Jack Sommersby, a former soldier, returns home to his farm. Nothing is left but a black shadow which The Civil War has left behind to the people of the village and farm. Jack gives hope to everyone again by starting a tobacco industry on his own farm. Everyone in the village, including black people have ownership in Jack Sommersby's very promising business... everything seem to be more promising to everyone but racism and a jealous man are some of the struggling terms to overwin.
At the end of the Civil War, during which Southern estate owner jack Sommersby was presumed killed, a Confederate veteran reruns to his town to resume Jack's life. Only wife Laurel, son Ron nor the family dog, who dies suspiciously shortly after, actually recognizes Jack, who behaves much nicer then the pre-war man. However everybody likes the better Jack enough to play along or convince themselves it's jack, who comes up with a tobacco growing plan to reboot the war-wrecked local economy and emancipate landless workers, even the ex-slaves. It works, as Laurel dismisses her ex-fiance Orin's doubts that fake jack may be a scammer. Then outsiders arrive and force everyone to deal with the record of this Jack and some other people, presumably including the real one, being involved in serous crimes heard in court.
