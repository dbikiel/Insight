Shortly after the launch of a satellite from a space shuttle the satellite collides with a UFO in front of the crew's eyes. Because of an election campaign some politicians try to hide the crashed UFO -- inside hangar 18.
During a Space Shuttle mission to launch a satellite it is rammed by a unidentified flying object. The UFO then performs an emergency landing in the deserts of Arizona. However the White House denies it's existence because of the near presidential elections. The UFO is brought to the secret hangar 18 and the accident is claimed to have been caused by the incompetence of the astronauts Bancroff and Price. But the two fight against this and try to hunt down the UFO.
