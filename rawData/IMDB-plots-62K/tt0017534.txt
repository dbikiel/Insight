Wealthy Brice Wayne enters West Point and, though he does well on the football field, angers fellow cadets with his arrogance. Disciplined by the coach he yells "To hell with the Corps!" which would have led to further discipline but for the intervention of his hero-worshipping roommate "Tex." He resigns anyway, but just before the big game returns to lead his team and reunite with Betty Channing, the hotel owner's daughter.
