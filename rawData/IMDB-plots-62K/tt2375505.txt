Twelve severed feet in running shoes found on the shores of Western Canada have baffled Police. A videotape is leaked anonymously from the authorities. This paranormal thriller may solve the mystery of the severed feet.
Between 2007 and 2011, twelve severed feet in running shoes have been found off the coast of Western Canada and Washington State. This is the only place in the world where severed feet are mysteriously washing up on shore. Police are baffled by this phenomenon as no other body parts have been discovered. Major news networks including, CNN, ABC, CBC, MSNBC, BBC, CTV as well as National Geographic have been following this bizarre story looking for answers. In 2007 a university nerd devised a plan to meet the hottest girls in his class by filming his history project on Kanaka Pete the Axe Murderer. Kanaka Pete was hung for chopping up his family. He was buried in an unmarked grave on Newcastle Island, which is also a hot spot for paranormal activity. This is in the same area where many of the severed feet have been found. The students were camping on Newcastle Island when something went very wrong. The tape that the students were making was recently leaked from the local authorities by an anonymous source. Will this footage finally solve the mystery of the severed feet?
