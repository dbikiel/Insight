A touring variety troupe, the "Dinky Doos" are in financial trouble. An encounter with three strangers - Inigo Jollifant (a romantic, song-writing ex-schoolmaster), Miss Trant (a philanthropic spinster in search of adventure), and Jess Oakroyd (a down to earth, practical man recently made redundant from his job) leads to a change of fortune. Re-launched with Miss Trant's money, they tour England, at first with little success. Inigo falls in love with the troupe's talented and pretty young girl singer, Susie Dean. The troupe is threatened with disharmony, but, due to Inigo's intervention, and the marriage of the principal dancer (Jerry Jerningham) to Lady Parlitt (whose family "own a chain of theatres"), all turns out well for Susie by the end, when she triumphs in a lavish London revue, with the other members of "The Good Companions" in the audience, cheering her triumph.
