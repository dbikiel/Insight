A grief-stricken man takes the law into his own hands when he begins to kidnap and murder corrupt public servants.
Gabbar Singh Rajput (Akshay Kumar) creates his own vigilante military network called the Anti-Corruption Force (ACF) that eliminates the most corrupt individuals, from all walks of life, in a systematic manner. As pressure builds on Police and Government to track down the man who masterminds these killings, Balbir Singh (Sonu Sood) is specially summoned to head the task. He is aided by Suryam (Prakash Raj) who, though being just a constable in the mammoth Police force, is compelled by his instincts to see through the underlying design.
There's no one more dangerous than a common man on a death wish. This is one such story of a man remorselessly wronged by the establishment. One freak incident results in everything he held dear taken away from him. Predictably, the system doesn't seem to care - let alone resolve. That's when Ajay (Akshay Kumar) takes matters in his own hands. An underground vigilante army, a secret identity, an elaborate modus...all of these combined make a 'GABBAR'- a true hero, with dreadful villainous instincts.
