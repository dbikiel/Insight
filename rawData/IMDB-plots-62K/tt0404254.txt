Some mysterious force with the strength of gravity between two planets must be at play between Charlie and Jordan as the relationship truly makes no sense on the surface. Everything seems pitted against the two of them. Things suddenly come to a halt when the two write letters confessing their love for each other. Agreeing to meet a year later to read the love letters together, Charlie and Jordan go their separate ways.
For those few of you who didn't see the Korean version, My Sassy Girl is the story of a meek guy, Charlie (Bradford), who falls for a crazy girl, Jordan (Cuthbert). Charlie takes Jordan home after finding her passed out drunk on a subway platform, and his role as a reliable friend and caregiver continues long after, even in the event of constant verbal, physical and psychological abuse.First Maq
