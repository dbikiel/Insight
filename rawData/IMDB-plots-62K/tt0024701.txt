Annie the tugboat captain tries to help two young lovers come together.
Waterfront couple raise their son to be a sea captain. He grows up to be rather snotty and rebels against drunken Beery. Valiant Dressler keeps things moving even as hubby ruins their tugboat business. Dressler dotes on his son and his snooty girlfriend.
Secoma, Washington based tugboat, the Narcissus, is owned and captained by Annie Brennan. Among her crew are her drunkard but good natured husband, Terry, and her conscientious son, Alec. Annie continually loses business because of Terry's mistakes. In turn, Alec wants to quit school to work on the tug full time, but Annie will not sacrifice her son's education. A grown Alec has followed in his mother's footsteps and becomes a mariner, but a more upscale one as the captain of a luxury liner. Alec returns to Secoma with his fianc√©e, Pat - the boss' daughter - and with a grand plan to save Annie from the life that drunkard Terry has provided her. But ultimately, it's Annie and Terry that need to be Alec's savior, and by their move show him the meaning of true commitment.
