With a war on and most men being drafted, Howard Oil Supply Company has no salesmen left. So daughter Jean hits the road and does not make one sale. She finally gets one tentative sale with the Black Hills Oil Co., but Earl wants dinner with her. With the shortage of housing due to the war, Jean needs a military husband to get a place to stay in Clayfield, which is next to Camp Clay. She gets Lt. Mallory to act as her husband just to register. Then things go wrong as his commanding officer is there and believes them to be married. It gets worse as Don's mother shows up and then Jean's father.
Due to the wartime man shortage, formerly idle Jean Howard becomes a sales representative for her father's oil-drilling equipment company. She's just getting the hang of it when she's stranded in an army-base town with no place to stay...unless she's an Army bride. Unsuspecting Lieut. Mallory is fast-talked into registering as her husband, then finds his commanding officer is living at the same motel; and that's just the start of the complications. Lots of physical comedy.
