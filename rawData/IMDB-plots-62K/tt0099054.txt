The classic comic book characters created by John L. Goldwater are brought to tv in a slightly older version. Here the characters are adults returning to their high school reunion and remembering old times and romances from good old Riverdale High.
The comic book characters of Archie, Jughead, Betty, Veronica, Reggie, and the rest are brought to life in this live action version. They are now adults; Archie's a lawyer, who is looking forward to finally leaving Riverdale, Betty's a school teacher, Jughead's a psychiatrist who spends most of his time talking about his own problems than his patients. Veronica's a socialite and Reggie is still as obnoxious as ever. Currently he plans to demolish Pop's their old hangout, so Pop's asks Archie to look into it and discovers some interesting facts. And all this while they are about to attend their high school reunion. And Archie though engaged has to deal with his feelings for Betty and Veronica.
