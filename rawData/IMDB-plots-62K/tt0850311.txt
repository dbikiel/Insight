Phil MacNaughton is 43-year old copy-writer in advertising. Because he's a hypochondriac neither he nor his wife take it seriously when he feels a lump in his groin, but after a referral by his GP the specialist diagnoses a tumor and amputates one testicle. However it spread, so an intensive radiation therapy is unavoidable. Meanwhile he tries to live as normal as possible, but slowly the pressure mounts both on the home front (wife, teenage daughter and small son Todd) and at work, where he fears his boss will replace him by younger talent.
