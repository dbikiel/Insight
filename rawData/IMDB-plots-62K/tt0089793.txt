Pelle is a cat who was born without a proper tail. He compensates this by studying hard and, much to the dismay of his archrival MÃ¥ns, receives a fancy degree very few cats in Sweden have obtained. Some time later he is visited by his relative Pelle Swanson who invites him over to visit his new home country America. There everything is bigger, even the rats are much fatter. Everything seems possible in America, even the prospect of finally having a proper tail and a sweetheart to call one's own.
