A college student gets pregnant without having intercourse, affecting people close and unrelated to her in different ways.
In this modern retelling of the Virgin birth, Mary is a student who plays basketball and works at her father's petrol station; Joseph is an earnest dropout who drives a cab. The angel Gabriel must school Joseph to accept Mary's pregnancy, while Mary comes to terms with God's plan through meditations that are sometimes angry and usually punctuated by elemental images of the sun, moon, clouds, flowers, and water. Godard intercuts a brief parallel story of Eva and her nameless lover; their adulterous affair, rife with philosophical discussions, leads nowhere.
The student Marie, who plays basketball and works in the gas station of her father, gets pregnant without having intercourse. The taxi driver Joseph becomes upset and the newcomer in town Gabriel convinces Joseph to accept her pregnancy. Meanwhile the college student Eva has an affair with her professor.
