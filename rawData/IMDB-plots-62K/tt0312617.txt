A former FBI agent must stop a madman from setting off a bomb.
When a bomb, delivered to a law firm's skyscraper office, kills 15 night crew and senior partner Anne Harrington, irreverent postal inspector Beau Stoddard competently traces it. Officially he's just FBI liaison. Nominee director of Domestic Security Robert Brickland, Beau's hated ex-boss at bomb squad and FBI, grudgingly lets him collaborate with ex-partner Jane Dreyer. Soon after U.S. Attorney Fred Goldenberg is also bombed. Anonymous letters suggests the link is drug hood James Grimes, but he maintains his innocence while dying in a bloody arrest. Beau pushes on, fearing a dirtier plot.
