Toji is a popular high school boy who is easy to get, but difficult to keep. He will date anyone who asks him on a Monday, but is done with the person by the end of the week. Fellow student Yuzuru has broken many girls' hearts and been dumped often. Then Yuzuru becomes interested in Toji and spontaneously asks him out.
