A teenager returns home to relax during his summer vacation; however, in a mansion full of women, he will have no other choice but to expand his education in a more titillating way.
Roger (Fabrice Josso) is a 16-year-old who seeks to lose his virginity in this softcore erotic drama. His initial efforts are unsuccessful, but World War I breaks out and men are seen marching off to battle. Roger goes overboard when he is presented with several amorous opportunities. He soon impregnates the maid, his aunt, and his sister in quick succession. Roger desperately tries to marry off the women to other men to avoid a lurid scandal.
Sent to a boarding school for three long years, the 15-year-old student, Roger, finally returns home--and right from the start--swift and naughty glances here and there foretell that this won't be an ordinary summer. Already filled with an ever-growing sexual curiosity that demands attending, Roger will soon realise that his parents' mansion is actually a tantalising playground full of women, including his sisters; his aunt; the governess, and the very promising maids. Bored to death inside a nearly vacant house, the boy will discover all the dirty little secrets kept behind closed doors, as his dormant, yet raw teenage sexual force gradually awakens. Suddenly, from a docile and gentle kid, Roger will transform into a proper kinky rascal--and when WWI breaks out--he will be left all alone to console the poor and unprotected women. Inevitably, Roger will seize the opportunity, and like a rooster in a hen house, he will ultimately perfect himself. After all, this is no ordinary summer.
