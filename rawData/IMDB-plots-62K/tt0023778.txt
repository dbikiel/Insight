An American tourist catches the eye of a disguised Arab prince who decides to kidnap her, then try to win her love.
A racy story of Myrna, who arrives in Cairo to meet her fiance. She attracts the attention of Ramon, a conniving Arab guide who enchants rich women tourists in order to take advantage of them. She falls under his spell, and he turns out to be more than he seems.
In Cairo, Arab Jamil El Shehab is a hustler, he preying on wealthy and lonely female tourists. Using his charms and good looks, he is able to persuade them to use his services as a guide, while they happily provide him with their generosity and affections, and perhaps unwillingly their jewels which he is often able to pilfer from them as they bid their adieus. Jamil's latest target is Diana Standing, a half Egyptian Brit who is in Cairo with an entourage including her fianc√©, Gerald Hume, the two who are getting married while in Egypt. Jamil is able to convince the entourage to use his services as a driver and guide, much to Diana's dismay, she who is immune to his charms. Beyond his immediate attraction to Diana, Jamil slowly falls in love with her and thus has to balance his desires for her and initial goal of romancing her for his short term benefit. Beyond Gerald, Jamil will have some further competition in the form of Pasha Achmed, an Egyptian business associate of Gerald's, who is also attracted to Diana. All of Jamil's work in Cairo belies his true heritage, who may or may not sway Diana if she were to find out.
