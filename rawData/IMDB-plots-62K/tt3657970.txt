Modris, a 17-year-old, is like many teenagers in his small town. He has developed an addiction to gambling and is frequently in trouble. As his mother turns him to the police, now he struggles to keep out of jail.
Modris (17) is no better or worse than his peers. He goes to school, has a girlfriend, some good friends. His gambling addiction makes his relationship with mother difficult. They live alone and she doesn't miss a chance to remind him his father is in prison and Modris has a bad gene. Their boiling relationship goes over the lid, when Modris pawns his mother's electric heater, trying to squeeze a win from a slot machine. She betrays him to the police and Modris is sentenced to two years probation. This is when his adventures with the Latvian justice system start, along with the change of his relationship to the outside world and his new goal: to find the father he has never met.
