The life of a Jazzplayer: Teddy Schu (Helge Schneider) loves Jazz and plays nightly in a small pub with his two friends. Sadly, there is no audience and the owner can't pay them anything for their music. Hence Teddy has to work 3 jobs to satisfy his grumpy wife. In the evenings he always finds a minute to sit with a homeless and nameless friend underneath the bridge and wonder about life and the legendary Jazz player Earl Mobileh. Jazz meets Dada!
