South Africa's paramedics face a surge of violent crime and historic social change 15 years since the end of its oppressive Apartheid era.
Shot on board with the paramedics of Pretoria and Johannesburg, "Tell Me And I Will Forget" illuminates the new social challenges in South Africa, 15 years after the end of its oppressive Apartheid era. Desperate human circumstance and a wave of violent crime have put immense pressure on the medical system, which is now as divided as the country's dual economy. With the on going US medical debate, the documentary provides a timely look into the much less glamorous side of the nation that hosted the 2010 World Cup Football Games.
