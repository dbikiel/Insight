Comedy based on the plight of modern Native Americans living on reservations.
A hard-drinking, reckless-living Indian named Flapping Eagle decides that his people have been pushed around by the white man long enough. Mounting his horse H-Bomb, Flap proceeds to hijack a railroad, lasso a helicopter, and begin the Last Great Indian Uprising. His assaults on the Establishment provide an earnest indictment of Indian neglect by the U.S. government.
Flapping Eagle, an Indian short on character but long on spirit, determines to do something to call attention to the plight of his people living on a southwestern reservation. He confers with his closest friends, young Eleven Snowflake, who dreams of becoming a journalist; Lobo Jackson, a strong and reliable man; Wounder Bear Mr. Smith, a student of obscure laws and old Indian treaties. Concerned about what might happen if the tribe takes ill-advised action are Ann Looking Deer, in love with Eleven Snowflake; and Mr. Storekeep, owner of a shabby general store where Ann works and where Flap and his friends gather for discussions lubricated with bad bootleg whiskey. Between strategy conferences, Flap tries, to no avail, to ride and tame 'H-Bomb,' his mean, alcoholic horse,a veteran of the rodeo circuit. He also makes relaxing visits to the bordello run by his off-and-on sweetheart, Dorothy Bluebell. Using a clause in an 1884 treaty uncovered by Wounded Bear Mr. Smith, Flap begins his war against the Man. He soon becomes a fugitive but Wounded Bear Mr Smith finds a useful clause in an 1853 treaty and Flap organizes The Last Great Indian Uprising.
