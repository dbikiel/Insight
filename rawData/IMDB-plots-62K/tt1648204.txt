Five high school kids, Olivia, Wendall, Stella, Charlie, and Mo, meet in detention and start a band based on the lemonade vending machine outside the detention room.
"Lemonade Mouth" tells kids and tweens that building your confidence rocks and finding your destiny rules. The story follows five disparate high school students - Olivia (Bridgit Mendler), Mo (Naomi Scott), Charlie (Blake Michael), Stella (Hayley Kiyoko), and Wen (Adam Hicks) who meet in detention. They realize they are destined to rock, and ultimately form a band that becomes a champion for students sidelined by the high school elite.
According to social status, you need to play sports the best to be the best. But when five kids break that rule, their whole school goes in a frenzy of people on their side and off their side. This is how the band, Lemonade Mouth is born!!!
