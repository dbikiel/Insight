A Group of teenagers test the legend of an immortal witch and get more than they bargained for.
"Season of the Equinox, the witch besets her kill. One less soul in the town to know, taken against their will." It is a bedtime story nearly every kid in the small town of Summerset has heard. A silly story passed down from generation to generation that offers just enough chills to keep the legend alive. This year is different. Seven year old Amanda Drake is swiped from her bedroom window. Rumors swirl. The Witch has returned. Always up for a good fright, and a chance to impress the girls, 18 year old Zach and his friends decide to sneak into the woods and find the mysterious old house where the legendary Witch supposedly lives. Unbeknownst to Zach, his younger brother Max and Max's "girlfriend" Sammy sneak along. They all soon discover that folklore isn't always myth and that bedtime stories sometimes come true. The Witch has indeed returned, intent on casting her magical spells to deceive, hunt and ultimately consume the local children - little ones to keep her young, older ones to keep her strong and pretty ones to keep her beautiful. Zach and Max, who can't stand each other, and their teenage friends find themselves trapped in the Witch's lair. They must bury their differences or be buried themselves. There is no escape from "The Wicked" once the spell has been cast.
Six young people, spooked but not undaunted by the folklore surrounding an old haunted house, make their way to the abode of the legendary Wicked, perhaps hoping to provoke the malevolent witch, but clearly not prepared for what they've certainly unleashed.
