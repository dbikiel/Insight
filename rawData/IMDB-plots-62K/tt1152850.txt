Over the summer, a series of unfortunate happening triggers a financial crisis for a young woman and she soon finds her life falling apart.
A woman's life is derailed en route to a potentially lucrative summer job. When her car breaks down, and her dog is taken to the pound, the thin fabric of her financial situation comes apart, and she is led through a series of increasingly dire economic decisions.
Dreaming of the cold Alaskan landscapes and a better future, young Wendy Carroll and her dog, Lucy, become stranded in a small Oregon town, when her old, rusty, and decrepit car breaks down. Hungry, without friends, and almost penniless, Wendy will have to resort to desperate measures, only to come face to face with her worst fear. Suddenly, Ketchikan and the unfulfilled promise of a profitable employment in a fish cannery start to fade away. Can the two companions finish their long journey to freedom?
