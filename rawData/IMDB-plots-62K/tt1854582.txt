With no other option, the friends are convinced to spend the night but soon realize they are trapped, then are tortured and killed off one at a time. Now, they'll need to work together and fight to survive the seemingly helpful group of people who have turned their overnight stay into a dreadful, gory nightmare.
Seven friends from Sacramento California all decide to go on a documented trip to Las Vegas. All seems fun until they hit a detour/road block. A couple hours of lost driving later, both of the back tires on the truck are blown out! After some moments of confusion and arguing, the gang comes up with the plan that all the girls will stay inside the truck while all the guys walk down the road to find HELP. A couple miles down the road, the guys find a little gas station Diner/Motel, run by the most friendly, polite and "helpful" people. The guys think they're in luck when they're offered HELP by the super friendly gas station attendant, who just happens to be great with cars. It appears that their problems are solved, but boy are they wrong! When convinced by "The Helpers" to stay overnight, the friends all wake up in their rooms to a new kind of gruesome and bloody terror!
