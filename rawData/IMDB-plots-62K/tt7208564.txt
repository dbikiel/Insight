Fans flock to a festival celebrating the most iconic horror movies, only to discover that the charismatic showman behind the event has a diabolical agenda. As festival attendees start dying off, three teenagers - more schooled in horror-film cliches than practical knowledge about neutralizing psycho killers - must band together and battle through various madmen and monstrosities to survive.
The teenager Dax has a deep trauma from his childhood since his mother was murdered by a maniac in the Halloween and his father, the psychiatrist Dr. Conway, killed the man in their house. Dax is a lover of horror films and has bought the ticket for the Blood Fest Festival with his friends Sam and Krill that also love the genre. However, his father finds and destroys the ticket and Dax calls his friend, the wannabe actress Ashley (Barbara Dunkelman) that helps him to cross the gate of the festival field. When the festival begins, Dax, Sam, and Krill learn that people are really killed by the maniacs and the gore is not fake. Now they need to find a way out of the festival to survive.
