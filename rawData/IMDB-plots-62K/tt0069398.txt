Godard examines the structure of movies, relationships and revolutions through the life of a couple in Paris.
Jean-Luc Godard dissects the structure of society, movies, love and revolution. He asks compelling questions: Can love survive a relationship? Can ideology survive revolution? He also looks at the French student riots of the 1960s with a critical eye, and ends up satirizing contemporary views of history. A battery of thoughts complete with criticism of modern society and movies.
"Tout va bien" is set in 1972, i.e. four years after the "events" of 1968. President De Gaulle and his successor president Pompidou had rolled back the would-be revolution and the political right wing held France in its grip. And yet "everything's fine" (tout va bien). Relations between people have changed. A factory is occupied, a woman striker phones her husband and tells him to mind the children, a Communist Party militant sells party literature in a supermarket and is ignored by young people (his party dominated the left before 1968).
