Modern retelling of Hansel and Gretel. After committing a murder, a young couple on the run find refuge in a remote cottage in the woods, where they become trapped by the perverse hermit who lives there.
After a perverted impulse drives them to kill, Alice and her boyfriend, Luc, drag the body into the woods, only to find themselves hopelessly lost - much like the fairy-tale plight of Hansel and Gretel. Starving and with no hope of being found, they chance upon a dilapidated cottage where a hulking man takes them prisoner and proceeds to feed Luc's sexual appetite.
The movie begins with an explicit murder scene. We later learn high school student Alice (Natacha Régnier) convinced her lover, Luc (Jérémie Renier), to murder their classmate Saïd (Salim Kechiouche), whom she claims raped her with a group of his friends. After the murder they take Luc's parents' car and go off to rob a jewelry store. When they dispose of the body in the woods, the couple get lost on their way back to their car and are captured by a mysterious forest dweller (Miki Manojlovic). Matters take an even more bizarre twist when the stranger locks the young lovers in his basement and reveals that he plans to eat them.
The movie shows the events that led up to the murder of their classmate and the ordeals the two lovers undergo in the cabin. Alice is very sexually active, but Luc is still a virgin. Sometimes it feels like a bizarre twist of Grimm's "Hansel and Gretel" in true François Ozon style.
