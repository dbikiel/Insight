Toward the icebreaker "Mikhail Gromov" is moving a huge iceberg. Leaving from collision, the ship falls into the ice trap, and is forced to drift near the coast of Antarctica.
Towards the icebreaker "Mikhail Gromov" is moving a huge iceberg. Leaving from collision, the ship falls into the ice trap and is forced to drift near the coast of Antarctica. Around it only an ominous silence and a bitter cold. Fuel is running out - Nerves on edge - And even if it would be possible to go, nowhere to go anyway. The crew of the icebreaker is no margin for error. One wrong decision and heavy ice crushed the ship.
