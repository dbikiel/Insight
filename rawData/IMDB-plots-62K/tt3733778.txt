One year after Mike Lawford's young son disappeared during a Halloween carnival, he is haunted by ghostly images and terrifying messages he can't explain. Together with his estranged wife, he will stop at nothing to unravel the mystery and find their son-and, in doing so, he unearths the legend of the crying woman who refuses to remain buried in the past.

Mike meets his family and takes his son Charlie to see the Halloween parade while his wife Kristen goes home to prepare a design for her client. While buying a cone for Charlie, the boy asks whether they can pay the ghost and vanishes. Mike and Kristen seek out the boy and he presses NYPD Detective Jordan to find his son. One year later, Mike researches and finds that children that disappear on Halloween are never found by the police. Furthermore every year three children vanish.
