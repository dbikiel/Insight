A mare dies while foaling the Red Stallion. He is reared by a boy and is entered in a big race - something like the Kentucky Derby.
Yong Joel Curtis finds an orphaned colt in the woods, whom he names "Red" and raises and trains him. When he learns that his grandmother is going to have to sell her ranch to pay off the debts, he trains Red, with the help of Andy McBride, as a race horse with the intention of selling his beloved animal friend in order to pay off his grandmother's debts.
