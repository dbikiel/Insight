Tired of boring life frog decides to travel by hitchhiking.
In the swamp lived a frog. In the autumn, ducks, flying to the south, stopped at the swamp. From the ducks frog learned about the south and wanted to fly with them. She asked the ducks to take the ends of the twig with their beaks, so that the frog, grasping its mouth with the middle of the twig, would go south along with the pack. The ducks admired the mind of the frog and agreed to bring it to the south.
