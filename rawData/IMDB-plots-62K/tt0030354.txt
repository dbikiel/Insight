On parole (he was framed of course), Larry Rhodes can't carry a gun. And his sweetheart is in danger of a forced marriage...
Serving a five year sentence for robbing a stage, Larry Rhodes is paroled early and returns to his hometown bent on clearing himself and discovering the identity of his father's killer. Things get more complicated when he learns that his former girlfriend, whom he still loves, is scheduled to be married to the local land baron's son.
Larry Rhodes, whose opposition to powerful rancher Tom Marsh got him framed and jailed for stage robbery, is paroled and returns to Valley Junction, Arizona. His welcome is not exactly warm, except from old pal Tim Wade. Moreover, Marsh is about to force his ward (and Larry's sweetheart) Norma to marry his son, thus keeping control of her property. Not allowed to pack a gun, Larry must use his wits to defeat his powerful enemy.
