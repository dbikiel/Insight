In cold and snowy taiga, the Tiger cub had no home. So he was looking for a warm and safe place to hide.
A small Ussuri tiger cub Amba, fleeing from the severe cold in a snowdrift, found a sprouted sunflower seed and warmed it. The next morning, a huge sunflower grew over the taiga, and in its very center, covered with petals, a tiger cub was sleeping. That is how Amba stayed living on a sunflower. With the onset of autumn strong winds blew, and the sunflower fell to the ground. Tiger cub climbed under the flower and fell asleep. And after a while, the seeds of this sunflower sprouted, a lot of huge flowers grew around the cub.
