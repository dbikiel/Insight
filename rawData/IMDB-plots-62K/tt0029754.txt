Karloff is the Chinese warlord Fang, who holds a group of oilmen and missionaries hostage in a remote Chinese outpost.
Gordon Creed travels to a remote site in the Chinese back country in order to obtain rights to a great oil reserve owned by wildcatter Jim Hallet, who is in danger of losing the rights to foreclosure. Creed's estranged wife is a missionary at the same locale, and she is in love with Hallet. When a bandit/warlord named General Wu Yen Fang takes over the village, Creed tries to play his own wife off the general in an attempt to cheat Hallet out of his oil and to escape the clutches of the warlord.
