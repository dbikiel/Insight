Set in the future where the countries of Earth have established colonies to mine the Moon's resources. When a new life form is discovered, chaos erupts as various factions race to uncover and exploit its powerful secrets.
The whole Moon has been divided into 5 zones (related to Earthen countries), and there is one monopoly consortium which sells the oxygen to everyone. Each zone is focused on extracting precious Helium-3. The lunar-suits provide self-gravity, and they create their own invisible helmet to contain the oxygen. The North-American zone is under the control of an Army General, and the civil workers are Earthen convicts. One of those criminals finds what seems to be a red lunar-flower with blue roots in the site of an inspection, on Moon surface. Few seconds after he touches that flower, there is a huge explosion in a nearby crater which began a moon-quake that swallows the convict and others. The appointed detective for investigation is the elder brother of the convict who touched the flower. The inquiry unveils a huge mystery that involves Russians, Indians, Japanese, the consortium, Helium-3, the convict, the fragile General's daughter, a mysterious technological gay spy Russian officer, some betrayals, more explosions, more flowers with pollen, new forms of life that appear and disappear, a mechanical T-Rex, artificial oxygen, and the vanishing of thousands of humans.
