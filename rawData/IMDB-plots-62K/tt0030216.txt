Teddy Shaw, a bored New York office girl, goes to a camp in the Catskill Mountains for rest and finds Chick Kirkland.
Ginger Rogers, an overworked New York office girl, seeks 2 weeks of rest and relaxation at a camp in the Catskills. She is definitely not a happy camper because of the crowded and noisy conditions. She tries her best to fit in and, after an initial dislike, falls for college educated Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., a waiter at the camp. Ginger becomes suspicious of his motives, however, and he becomes alarmed when she spends an innocent night in the cabin of a rival suitor. All ends happily, however, as their love proves true enough and trust triumphs over suspicions.
Thelma Shaw - Teddy to her friends - comes from a working class Bronx background, the Bronx where she still lives in cramped quarters with her parents, her sister and her sister's family. She works in the oppressive steno pool in a New York office, and is a voracious reader in her spare time to better herself. She hopes to marry someone with her same interest in reading, unlike the uncouth young men she usually meets, such as Emil Beatty. Because of hating her boss, she is glad for a two week vacation to Camp Kare-Free in the Catskills, which is billed as an outdoor retreat. There, Teddy is surprised that she falls for Chick Kirkland, and he for her, as their initial encounters were antagonistic. Chick is a recent law school graduate working at the camp, as he can't find work as a lawyer. A Teddy-Chick happy ending is threatened by their perception of what a relationship between them with their respective current situations would be like, and others at the camp who may pick up the romantic pieces in the wrong way in the aftermath.
