Ten years after her failed marriage, recently fired mother Ellis "El" Vermeulen (Linda de Mol) and preteen son Thijsje (Hylke de Haan) get peanuts while her ex spends everything on new flame Mirella. She finally takes Susan's (Dame Joan Collins') amoral course "How To Marry A Millionaire". She actually gets socialites interested, including hunk Gijs (Chris Tates), a fine substitute dad for Thijsje. Of course, there is a catch.
