"Ein Tick anders" tells the story of the 17 year old Eva who suffers of Tourette Syndrom. She tries to find a way to avoid to have move from the countryside to Berlin with her parents as she fears the life of a big city. It's a very humorous film with strange characters and a great song (Arschlicht = butt light).
