Gauthier, a young journalist, learns through his mother that he's the illegitimate son of Guy Jamet, an aging French pop singer who was famous from the '60s to the '90s. As the old-time crooner embarks on a tour to promote his newly released cover album, Gauthier decides to follow him behind the scenes, on stage, and on the road, under the pretext of filming a documentary about his career.
