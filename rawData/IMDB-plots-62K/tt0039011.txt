As a spate of leopard attacks causes panic, a sceptical Tarzan joins a hunting expedition, only to face a pagan cult of Leopard-God worshippers and their fiendish High-Priestess. Can he escape the sharp claws of the savage Leopard Woman?
An African tribe devoted to the leopard cult is dedicated to preventing civilization from moving further into Africa. Tarzan fights them when the cult first attacks a caravan and next attacks Jane and Boy. Tarzan is captured. Boy is bothered by the Leopard Priestess' younger brother. Cheetah saves the day.
The District Commissioner is concerned when a trade caravan from Zambezi is attacked by leopards. Tarzan doesn't think that leopards were responsible as they can find only claw marks on the bodies. A secret leopard cult is at work determined to stop further European encroachment on their territory. When they kidnap a group of young women teachers, Tarzan sets off to save them. Meanwhile, a young boy who wants to prove his manhood to the cult's leader comes to live at Tarzan and Jane's tree house intent on killing Jane and gaining his place in the secret group.
An alarming spate of leopard attacks has caused widespread panic in the jungle, as the ferocious predators prey on unsuspecting travelling Zambezi caravans. With a sceptical Tarzan, a hunting expedition sets off to track down the murderous wildcats, unbeknownst to them that a blood-thirsty pagan cult of Leopard-God worshippers is bent on destroying any form of civilisation in the lush wilderness. Their beautiful but fiendish High-Priestess, Lea, thirsts for human blood. Will Tarzan escape from the sharp claws of the savage Leopard Woman?
