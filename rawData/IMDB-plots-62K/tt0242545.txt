About Jackie Chan is written and filmed very much. A living legend, a unique creative personality, one of the biggest movie stars in the history of cinema, a man whose enthusiastic love for his work knows no equal in the world, the man who put life into cinema piggy bank. Striking person. Man of dreams.
