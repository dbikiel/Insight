An ambitious mechanic is tempted to desert his wonderful girlfriend when a silly but rich debutante falls for him.
Blackstone 'Blacky' Gorman, rising service station owner, is blessed with the devotion of supremely sweet and noble Marje Harris, but he meets coquettish and silly debutante Glory Franklyn and, between Glory's charm and his social ambition, is snared into an upscale marriage that proves to have its downside.
In the small beachfront town of Silver Beach, Massachusetts, working class Blacky Gorman and Marge Harris have been dating for quite some time. Marge is Blacky's touchstone, she who encouraged him to get where he is in life, which includes owning and operating his own busy service station, the savings from which made him be able to buy a small house he can call home. Although nothing is official, Marge and her parents expect the two eventually to get married. When they get engaged to get engaged, Marge tells Blacky that all she ever ask of him is that he be straight with her about what he is feeling. Marge's comments are in light of she seeing that he is falling for big city Glory Franklyn, a ditsy socialite whose snobbish mother has just purchased a summer home in town. Marge sets Blacky free to allow him to do what's in his heart, she vowing to be his friend for life regardless in wanting him to be happy. Indeed, Blacky and Glory elope, the marriage against Mrs. Franklyn's wants, she who was arranging a marriage between Glory and someone in their social class named Sid Larrick. After the marriage, Marge is true to her word and does whatever she can for Blacky and Glory to have a happy domestic life together. The question then becomes if their situation with Blacky, Glory and Marge all being friends can last.
