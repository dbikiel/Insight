Frank "women in prison" story that sympathetically tracks several inmates through their imprisonment and subsequent return to society. Some are successfully rehabilitated; some are not.
When an upper class girl is sent to prison she finds herself in the company of many kinds of women, good and bad, nice and nasty, and all with a story to tell. She hates the regime, but part-way through her year's sentence she is moved to an experimental open prison.
