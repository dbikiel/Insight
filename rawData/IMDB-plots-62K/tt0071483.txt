A writer goes on a road trip across West Germany with a group of eclectic people he meets along the way.
In search of inspiration, the hopeful author, Wilhelm, sets out on a lonely journey of enlightenment with his encouraging mother's blessing, leaving behind him his hometown of Gl√ºckstadt. In high hopes of finding something to write, Wilhelm wanders about unknown and faceless towns; however, he is not alone. A weary old father and his silent teenage daughter; a well-known actress, and an Austrian wannabe poet become Wilhelm's companions in his never-ending quest to broaden his horizons; nevertheless, the fear of making one wrong move, and an inadvertent mistake seem to stand in the way of discovering his identity. Will Wilhelm find the truth and the miracle he seeks in the snow-capped summit of the Zugspitze?
Six days in the life of Wilhelm: a detached man without qualities. He wants to write, so his mother gives him a ticket to Bonn, telling him to live. On the train he meets an older man, an athlete in the 1936 Olympics, and his mute teen companion, Mignon. She's an acrobat in market squares for spare change. An actress, whom Wilhelm gazes at, joins them. Then, a plump young man introduces himself, having heard them talk of poetry. He takes them to his uncle's, except it's the wrong house; they interrupt a man's suicide. He invites them to stay. The actress tries to connect to Wilhelm. Couplings and rare bursts of feeling come as surprises; other characters remain alone.
