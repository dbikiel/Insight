A man loses everything. Again.
Tino and Jane are once again in financial difficulties. The couple's bank balance is saved thanks to the unexpected death of Uncle Olavinho, who left a heritage of $100 million to be divided equally between Jane and her mother, Estela. As the last wish of the uncle was that his ashes be thrown on the Grand Canyon, Tino takes his wife and his two children to know Las Vegas. However, he is excited about gambling in a casino and lose all the money earned by Jane at the poker table. To make matters worse, he ows $10 million to a henchman of the Mexican Mafia, who want to receive the money at all costs.
