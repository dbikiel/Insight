The lives of a group of young Chicago men, as seen through the eyes of one of them, a thirty-something writer suffering from the early onset of midlife crisis brought on by nostalgia, his dying friend and the wedding of his old flame.
Danny and his friends used to be great dreamers as kids. They called themselves The Rogues, always stuck together and had high hopes and big plans for the future. They were inspired by heroic pirates from old movies like Errol Flynn's Captain Blood. They'd watch these films together and dream about becoming bald adventurers themselves one day. A couple of decades later, the Rogues are still together but they are now busy with their adult lives and hardships and it seems like only Danny, a struggling writer, and Sol, his somewhat well-off, happy-go-lucky best friend, still like to goof around. Mickey is now the owner of a busy night club, Pete is a TV reporter for a daily show, Marty is a small businessman, Eddy is a failed stock broker who's facing jail time and Bobby is a fully committed family man. When Danny learns that his old flame and ex-girlfriend Emily, the one that got away, is getting married, he realizes that he still has feelings for her and Sol convinces him to think about contacting her again before it's too late. Unfortunately, Danny also learns that Sol is terminally ill with leukemia. As Danny nostalgically recollects how he met and started a relationship with Emily, he also tries to convince the Rogues to help him make one of Sol's biggest dreams come true - to set sail for the ocean on a real classic wooden sailboat, just like in the movies.
