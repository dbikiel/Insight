Two teen girls from a very restrictive Conservative Laestadian faith community, go alone to Helsinki for the first time.
Two 18-year old girls from a christian fundamentalist community flee to a city for a summer job. One of the girls, Maria, wants to see how the world is before going back home and getting married to a boy from the same community. She wants to try out things that are forbidden at home: Rhytm music, make up, kissing boys, dancing. The other girl, Raakel, is less adventurous and only wants to make sure Maria does return. The summer of temptations changes the life of one of the girls - for good.
