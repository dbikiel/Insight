Third documentary of a trilogy produced on the long term (together with Profils paysans: l'approche (2001) and Profils paysans: le quotidien (2005)), showing the simple lives of farmers in contemporary Southern France.
This the last part of Depardon's triptych "Profils paysans" about what it is like to be a farmer today in an isolated highland area. "La vie moderne" examines what has become of the persons he has followed for ten years while featuring younger people who try to farm or raise cattle or poultry, come hell or high water.
