Cheerleading squads traveling on a bus to a state competition are kidnapped for ransom by former football players.
A bus-load of cheerleaders is hijacked and held for a $2 million ransom. After several comic and arousing interactions, eventually the girls are forced by their captors to participate in a topless "beauty pageant" in which they must pose before their captor-"judges" in nothing but their underwear.
