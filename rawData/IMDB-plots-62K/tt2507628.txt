WAR OF THE WORLDS THE TRUE STORY is based on the most beloved alien invasion story of all time by Father of Science Fiction, H.G. Wells. Like Wells' classic book that was presented as a news reporter's first hand memoirs, and the famous 1938 Orson Welles radio broadcast that caused Americans to believe an actual invasion was in progress, WAR OF THE WORLDS THE TRUE STORY assumes the world knows there was a war between Earth and Mars in the year 1900 and is presented as the eyewitness account of Bertie Wells, the last living survivor of the Earth/Mars War as he struggles to find his wife amidst the destruction of humankind at the hands of terrifying alien invaders.
In this adaptation of HG Wells' signature novel, the plot of Martians invading Victorian England takes the form of a found footage 'mockumentary', as the last living survivor discusses his extraordinary tale of survival during The War of the Worlds.
