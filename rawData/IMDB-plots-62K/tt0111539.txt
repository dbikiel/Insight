This is based on a true story about two sisters who sue their father for incest and child abuse. As the story unfolds, it is revealed that the father severely abused all six children, and committed incest with all four of his daughters. The two sons received the worst of the physical abuse. The mother stood haplessly by and allowed her husband to control the family through his methods of "discipline". The movie includes graphic descriptions and scenes of the abuse which are disturbing.
