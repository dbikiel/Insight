Two brothers have half of a powerful ancient Chinese talisman. An evil gang leader has the other half, and determines to get the brothers' half and have a complete medallion so he can gain absolute power.
Set 15 years in the future in post-earthquake California, where San Diego and Los Angeles are merged into one city, two teenage brothers have half of a powerful ancient Chinese talisman. Millionaire Koga Shuko (a.k.a. Guisman) has the other half and determines to get the brothers' half in order to have the complete medallion and the absolute power of the magical Double Dragon talisman.
In the years following the great Los Angeles earthquake, two orphans are raised and trained in martial arts by Satori, who also happens to be the caretaker of one half of a magic amulet. When the evil Koga Shuko finds the other half, he immediately goes on the attack to take Satori's piece and claim the power contained within the amulet. Only Satori's two boys, Billy and Jimmy, can stop Koga from reaching his goal.
