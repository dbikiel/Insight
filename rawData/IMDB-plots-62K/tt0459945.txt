Dr. Watson executes Sherlock Holmes' will, who faced death after exposing Moriarty and his gang in the previous episode.
Dr. Watson reads the dying message of Mr. Holmes, in which he disposes of his property, asks for the doctor's service and bids farewell to all his acquaintances. Mrs. Hudson hard takes the news of the death of a long-standing and incomprehensible lodger. She is not ready for anyone to rent his room and wants to organize a museum in honor of the great detective Sherlock Holmes. The doctor continues to go to the club, where he watches the young Ronald Ader, who is in danger. One evening, Watson notices how Colonel Morton's assistant approaches him and orders Ader to send money to the address indicated in the card. Ronald does not give in to blackmail and threatens to uncover the true face of Morton through the press. The same night he is killed in his own house.
