With King Richard away at the crusades, Prince John rules England with an iron fist and tasks the Sheriff of Nottingham with the collection of high taxes and the capture of outlaw Robin Hood.
Young Robin Hood (Richard Todd), in love with Maid Marian (Joan Rice), enters an archery contest with his father at the King's palace. On the way home, his father is murdered by henchmen of Prince John (Hubert Gregg). Robin takes up the life of an outlaw, gathering together his band of merry men with him in Sherwood Forest, to avenge his father's death and to help the people of the land that Prince John are over taxing.
