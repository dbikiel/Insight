Boring businessman Larry Wilson recovers from amnesia and discovers he's really a con man...and loves his soon-to-be-ex wife.
While alone on a cruise, the upstanding - and mean - teetotaler, Larry Wilson, receives a blow on the head, causing him to revert to his old, forgotten persona of man-about-town and swindler, George Carey. Deciding to get what he can out of his position as Wilson, he returns to Wilson's hometown to continue the pretense. The only trouble is he takes a serious shine to his wife, Kay, and doesn't at all agree that Larry should be letting her go.
