Walter and Madge have grown apart: he lives on the floor and she lives on the ceiling. When Walter tries to reignite their old romance, the couple must face their equilibrium.
After many years of marriage, Walter and Madge have grown apart: he lives on the floor and she lives on the ceiling. When Walter tries to reignite their old romance, their equilibrium comes crashing down, and the couple that can't agree which way is up must find a way put their marriage back together.
Strangely, after decades of a shared life in a happy marriage, Walter and Madge find themselves drifting apart from each other over the course of years. As a result, Walter lives in his part of the house the right side up, while at the same time, his wife occupies the ceiling, living upside down. Of course, none of them notices his situation; to them everything is normal, nevertheless, is there a way to rectify this awkward and utterly confusing situation?
