A homeless loner moves into a self-storage facility for searching his past, but soon he realizes that this place is being haunted by a deranged female ghost.
Loosely based on the true events of a homeless loner who moves into a self-storage facility inhabited by a community of bizarre squatters until they are locked in for the night with a deranged female who hunts them down in search of her lost child.
Imagine "people under the stairs" meeting "not without my baby". That about sums it up for me.
