Health care during the Spanish Civil War is portrayed in this French made documentary: the progress under the new Republican government in setting up child care centers, the extent to which hospital care is provided at the battlefront or via trains to nearby facilities, the provision of convalescence care for wounded soldiers so that they can promptly return as needed to combat. The film concludes as a plea for help, with the Republicans still struggling.
