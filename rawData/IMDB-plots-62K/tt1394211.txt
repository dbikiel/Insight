Newlyweds Alex and Alice host a New Year's Eve party for their closest friends at a remote cabin in the mountains. However, when an unexpected guest shows up, the group's facades begin to crumble.
Although they have long been a couple, Alex, a lawyer turned failed/struggling playwright, and Alice, an insecure woman, have recently gotten married. They have invited several of their couple friends to Alex's parents' cabin in the woods upstate for New Year's Eve. They include: married Don and Lynn, he a poor writer but who would rather come up with crazy and thus ultimately doomed business ideas, and she a lawyer who wears the pants in the family and who seems oblivious to her drinking problem; lawyer Steven and pregnant Eve, who have previously admitted to attending marriage counseling sessions to deal with their issues; and businessman Nick, who is separated from his wife Melissa and was supposed to bring his much younger model girlfriend, Lola, for who he left Melissa and who ends up not coming since the two of them have now broken up. Alex and Alice's guests bring their open and not so open marital/relationship dysfunctions along for the gathering, those dysfunctions which are set against Alex and Alice's outward honeymoon bliss. However, the cracks existing in Alex and Alice's marriage have the potential to split wide open with the last minute addition of Helena, a British model, to the gathering, she who Alex and Alice know only casually as one of Eve's bridesmaids but who Alex tried to hit on at the wedding while he was already seriously dating Alice, that indiscretion that never was of which Alice is unaware.
