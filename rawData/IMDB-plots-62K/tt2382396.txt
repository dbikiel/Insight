An ex-con, who is the unlikeliest of role models, meets a 15-year-old boy and is faced with the choice of redemption or ruin.
In order to provide for his destitute family of drifters, a likable, sincere, able-bodied 15-year-old boy comes to hire on among a burned-out ex-con's group of aging forest laborers. As the man becomes more and more aware of the boy's abusive home life, his deeply buried humanity is roused. Drinking and smoking incessantly to remain detached from his volatile temper, he finally takes the matter into his own hands - come what may - when the boy's alcoholic father finally goes too far.
Joe Ransom is a heavy drinker who has lost a lot of time in his life. He may be irresponsible, but he is a hard worker. In a forest where he used to cut down trees, he meets Gary, a 15-year-old boy, and his father, Wade, an alcoholic bum. For Gary, all is not lost; there is still time for him to take the right path, as long as he escapes from the negative influence of his father. Joe takes Gary's side and, against all odds, the two of them eventually sympathize. The road to redemption in a small southern town is filled with lonely evenings, sweaty work, raw beers and wild guns.
