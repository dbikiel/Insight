A brave Army dog returns to the U.S., where he helps his heroic handler bond with his resentful daughter on a camping trip despite danger lurking around every corner.
Casper van Dien plays Army Sargent Tom Holloway. His partner and best friend is his bomb sniffing dog Conner. They go through a lot together so when Tom is ready to retire he returns home to his family with Conner in tow. Unfortunately his daughter Tara, played by Casper's real life daughter Grace, isn't all that pleased to have a new family member. She really missed her dad for all those years he was away and she naturally wants him all to herself now. Seeing him spending his time with Conner instead fills her with jealousy. Tom can see the anxiety his daughter is experiencing so he decides to take her and Conner on a camping trip to help them bond closer together and possibly even learn a little about teamwork. Unfortunately once in the mountains an unexpected occurrence leads to a danger filled adventure that tests the three campers.
