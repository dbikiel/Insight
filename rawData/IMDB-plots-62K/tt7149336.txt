An indecisive couple facing the fourth year of their engagement finally decides to take the next big step and have a threesome.
Malori and Caleb have been together for four years. The woman believes that Caleb is not a romantic young man, as evidenced by his act, when he again proposes to use his recently removed wisdom tooth as a temporary engagement ring. The inability of a young couple to commit themselves contrasts sharply with Mallory's sexually liberated parents, Louis and Edie, whom they visit in Palm Springs to see how they renew their wedding vows for the 25th year in a row. On weekends, they are embarrassed to find that one of the reasons for the successful marriage of her parents is their periodic participation in group sex when someone else is present. Thus, the couple decides to do a little sexual experiment on their own. In the bar, they meet Jesse a sexy New Age girl who invites them to her apartment. Jesse praises the nerve visitors for their sensual energy. But the meeting does not go as expected, as the couple's subsequent attempts to improve sex life. This fun and innocent new experience takes an intense turn, exposing deeper relationship problems and threatening their future together.
