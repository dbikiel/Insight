A nosy cab driver gets a hot tip on a race horse and wins big, but he can't seem to stop gambling. Will he go broke or walk home with a pretty penny?
An average kind of guy who has a slight problem with gambling goes to the track, and mystically, it seems as though he can't lose, no matter how he bets; and he has an incredible day.
A cab driver (Trotter) that just promised his wife he will quit gambling listens to a tape that his best friend made ( another cabby ) that has a tip on a horse race that's a sure thing!When the next morning comes and their shift ends they head to the track.When his best friend reminds him of the promise he made (Trotter) he tells him that gambling involves risk and with a sure thing there is no risk!Will Trotter Let it ride and have the best day of his life at the track with his misfit band of friends,Or will he lose it all.
