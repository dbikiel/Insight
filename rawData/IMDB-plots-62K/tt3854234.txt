A humble peon finds a job in a big city butcher's shop. His boss, a sinister character, introduces him to the meat business while subjecting him, by means of pressure and extortion, to slavery. The boss's overwhelming cruelty will inevitably lead to tragedy. Based on real facts.
With dreams of a better life, Hermogenes, a humble and honest but illiterate labourer, and his wife, Gladys, leave their poor village in Santiago to move to Buenos Aires. In desperate need of cash and a job, Hermogenes will finally find work as a butcher for the sinister Don Latuada, the dishonest owner of a meat shop chain, whose promise of a bright future comes at a high price. Little by little, as the eager apprentice learns the tricks of the trade, a hideous story of a modern 21st-century slavery will begin to unravel, right in the heart of the big city. In the end, when is enough, enough?
