Porter Stoddard is a well-known New York architect who is at a crossroads... a nexus where twists and turns lead to myriad missteps, some with his wife Ellie, others with longtime friends Mona and her husband Griffin. Deciding which direction to take often leads to unexpected encounters with hilarious consequences.
Upscale liberal New York couples, Porter and Ellie Stoddard, who have just celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary, and Griffin and Mona Morris, are best friends. Porter and Ellie even work together - he as an architect, she the chief designer of his buildings - and Porter and Mona have known each other as friends since they were children. Although both marriages are considered solid, Porter and Ellie's is seen as even more so since Porter is deemed to be an old fuddy duddy in his views. However, Mona catches Griffin cheating on her. This act brings into examination the individual relationships between the four, especially in Griffin wanting to get out information on the redhead Mona saw him with, and as Porter's chastisement of Griffin's infidelity is hypocritical since Porter has been having an affair with a cellist named Alex, although he isn't sure why he has felt the need to cheat let alone with Alex with who he has nothing in common. The further encounters that Porter has with a few other women - namely Eugenie Claiborne, who, along with her parents, have a less than conventional view of relationships, and a hardware store clerk named Auburn - may bring his relationship with Ellie into clearer focus.
