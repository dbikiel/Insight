In Pinkovia, Princess Lillifee and her friends are enjoying a beautiful summer. One night, however, the unicorn Rosalie appears to Lillifee in a dream and urgently asks for her help; she needs Lillifee to look after her baby Lucy. When Lillifee awakes, she discovers that Lucy has magically stepped out of her dream and is now sitting on her bed, fresh as a daisy. But what has happened to Rosalie?
