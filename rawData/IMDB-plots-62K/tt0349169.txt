Inspired by his fiancée (who dumped him), a man publishes a break-up hand-book for men, becoming a best-selling author in the process.
Quincy Watson, after being unceremoniously dumped by his fiancée, pens a "how to" book on breaking up and becomes a best-selling author on the subject. Not wanting his male friends to suffer the same fate, he gives them advice on dumping their mates. A comedy of errors ensues.
Jamie Foxx stars as Quincy in this semi-romantic comedy about a man who is dumped by his girlfriend, Helen (Bianca Lawson). Quincy was about to ask Helen for her hand in marriage at a party with all his friends; when unexpectedly, Helen just leaves him. Quincy is confused by the breakup, and he writes Helen a long letter about how she was supposed to breakup. Quincy's cousin Evan (Morris Chestnut) sees the letter, which is the size of a book, and gets the idea of publishing it. The book becomes a best seller. Evan wants to breakup with his girlfriend Nicky (Gabrielle Union), and gets Quincy's advice. This is the point where Quincy begins to break all the rules with Nicky. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy)
