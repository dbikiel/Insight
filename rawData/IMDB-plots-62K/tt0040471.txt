A bee is flying among Donald's flowers when he notices a veritable paradise of flowers in the guise of wallpaper Donald is hanging. The bee is rather frustrated when he is unable to stay on the flowers so Donald has some fun with the bee tormenting him with the fake flowers. The bee gets his revenge when Donald is accidentally pasted to the ceiling by the wallpaper making him an easy target for the bee's stinger.
