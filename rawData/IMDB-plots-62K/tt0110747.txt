A documentary that explores the life styles of various otakus in Japan. Various interviews are given to selected otakus who express how interesting it is to be an otaku as oppose to not being one at all. Along with various shots of various Japanese city landscapes and the inside of an average otaku home from rooms filled with videos, models, and the latest in technology.
Through detailed interviews we get a very close and intimate look into the development of a modern Japanese society in the beginning of the 21st century. Former workers (men) lacking identity turn into OTAKUS. You can describe this phenomenon as an answer, being a silent and hidden nonconformist with a attitude, in contrast of being a fashionable nerd of today. The atmosphere in this film is very strange and threatening because you feel already that the filmmakers know more about this topic. Very precise and without any tempting entertainment they crafted this film to a unique and very precious stone worth watching for the younger audiences.
The film describes the social changes that could be seen already in 1994 in Japan by two great European filmmakers. This film foreshadows a development that went global after the film- and gaming industry increased through up speeding their distribution and gamification of social media without limits.
