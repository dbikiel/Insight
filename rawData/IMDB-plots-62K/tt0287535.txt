Fact-based war drama about an American battalion of over 500 men which gets trapped behind enemy lines in the Argonne Forest in October 1918 France during the closing weeks of World War I.
In 1918 in World War I, in the Meuse-Argonne Sector in France, the former New York lawyer and Major Charles White Whittlesey is assigned by Gen. Robert Alexander to a massive suicidal attack against the German forces in the Argonne Forest with his five-hundred-man battalion. However, the forces supposed to be giving support through the flanks retreat and the communications with the headquarter of the 77th American Division are cut. Major Wittlesey holds his position with his men, mostly Irish, Polish, Italian and Jewish immigrants from New York, surrounded by the German army. Without food, water, ammunition and medical supplies, only two hundred men survive after five days of siege.
As the First World War draws to a close, American troops penetrate deep into German held French territory, under pressure from French and British allies to advance quickly and smash the last of the German Army in France. "The Lost Battalion" is the true story of a group of 800 American soldiers, attached to the 77th American Division, who were ordered to advance into the Argonne Forest, against heavy German resistance, and hold their position at whatever the cost.
