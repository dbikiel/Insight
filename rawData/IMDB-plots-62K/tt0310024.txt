A space shuttle crashes containing a lethal prototype organism designed to survive in any environment. The only people who can stop the creature are the Secretary of Defense agent and the female scientist who created it.
Dr. Nancy Burnham (Theresa Russell) created V.I.P.E.R., a genetically engineered organism which is able to turn Mars into a livable, Earth-like environment. But on the shuttle journey to the red planet, V.I.P.E.R. develops a taste for human flesh and kills the entire crew. After this disaster, a second V.I.P.E.R. prototype on Earth goes missing, and government agent Mike Connors (Patrick Muldoon) is called in to find it before it begins killing the people of Earth. Sci-fi meets suspense in this intense thriller.
