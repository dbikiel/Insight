Demons cross the divide between the world of dreams and waking reality to capture a victim and drag him back to their nightmarish realm.
Visions of Suffering is alive with outrageous special effects and astonishing visuals that propel the viewer into a surreal world he/she may never escape from. Demons stalk a victim in his sleep. They appear whenever the rain falls and threaten to break free from the land of dreams into his conscious world. A drug-induced vision allows the demons to escape their hellish realm, and the victim is dragged into their nightmare domain. The latest film from director Andrey Iskanov ("Nails", "Philosophy of a Knife"), this Russian tale of horror takes you on a stunning visual journey into the abyss of nightmarish hallucination.
