Five teenage friends will stop at nothing to attend a concert by their favourite band, The Stone Roses.
A wannabe rock band in Manchester hatch a plan to hand-deliver their demo tape to their idols, The Stone Roses, at the band's impending gig at Spike Island. But when their tickets fail to materialize, the gang embarks on a road trip to the concert and is forced to take extreme measures to sneak their way in. Along the way, friendships are tested and their futures are shaped - together or apart.
