A high school grad and a hooker-in-training try to track down his stolen Corvette.
Ken loves to design and build exotic cars. When the High School shop class project car, a fully tricked out dream Corvette, is stolen, he begins searching for it. His search leads him to Las Vegas, where Vanessa, a teenaged prostitute wannabe, helps him try to track it down.
High School Senior Kenny Dantley's only love in life is cars. For a shop class project, he and his classmates build a Corvette ("Stingray"). The car is a big hit -- so big, in fact, that gets stolen! Kenny, having fallen in love with the car, sets out on a summer-long adventure in Las Vegas to find it. Along the way, he meets up with a "hooker-in-training" named "Vanessa". The two encounter danger and romance as they try to steal back the Stingray.
