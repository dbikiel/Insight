In the beginning of the Twentieth Century, Coronel Ponciano de Azeredo Furtado inherits the farm Sobradinho in the country, many possessions and the title of "colonel" of his grandfather. His close friend Pernambuco Nogueira, son of one of the employees of the farm and with whom Ponciano was raised together since they were born, gets nothing in the will. Ponciano has a crush on his cuisine Esmeraldina, but he never declares his love to her. When he loses the mortgage of his farm to Nogueira, who got married to Esmeraldina, Ponciano goes to the court trying to prove that Nogueira is a werewolf.
Colonel Furtado struggles to keep his lands, the Sobradinho Farm, and win the heart of his cousin Esmeraldina. In the process, he fights big beasts, experiences the taste of a bohemian life in town, fends usurers and thieves off, and uses all his cunning to get rid of haunting entities. His rival is the man he was brought up with, Pernambuco Nogueira, a werewolf.
