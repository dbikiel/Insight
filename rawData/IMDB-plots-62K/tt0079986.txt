A reflection of Russian history and memory. Norstein creates a visual emotional response to a changing Russia, followed in the eyes of the Little Grey Wolf spying on various people's lives, and giving an insight on Russian culture in the 20th Century.
The film is an alternation of paintings, memories, moving the viewer in different eras. The main character of the film is a gray wolfy from a lullaby, watching the world with a sad understanding. Among the characters is a poet waiting for inspiration over a piece of paper; a washerwoman washing clothes in a trough; fisherman rushing home with a catch; boy sharing an apple with ravens. Next to the world of wonders, in which large ripe apples fall from the trees in winter, real life adjoins the stream of cars rushing along noisy highways.
