Anna breaks up with Bruno after he has cheated on her with their son Boris's schoolteacher. But her far too young lover can only temporarily offer distraction. Arno and her best friend Lydia's marriage, on the other hand, looks like the perfect marriage. But is it...? Between Alain and Fred all is roses: they are going to get married, or is the party over after all?
