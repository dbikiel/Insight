A guy gets his 2 friends on a plane to Colombia making them believe it's vacation. However, he plans on catching a drug lord and collect the $25M reward. They don't speak Spanish and think Colombia is a city in Mexico.
Two "down on their luck" buddies are convinced by a third to take a vacation. Only after landing in Colombia, South America, do they realize that they are there to attempt to capture the United States most wanted criminal - with no military training.
