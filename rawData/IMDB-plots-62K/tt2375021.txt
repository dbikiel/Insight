Aske (17) and Bastian's (12) mother died in a traffic accident seven years earlier while trying to save Aske from a rape by a friend of her husband's. The two brothers live with their father, Lasse. Every day they live in a world where fear, violence and alcohol are huge factors, but where the brothers' strong and close relationship means everything. Aske's fight for survival means that he has to serve his father's sexual needs, which include abuse from the father, but also from paying customers and the father's friend Hans (who has a lot of contacts in the pedophile environment). Aske tries everything to keep his little brother out of it all so that he won't experience the same as himself. But one day Bastian is abused by their father and Aske's entire world is about to fall apart. The brothers choose to move to Norway, far away in the beautiful mountains to his best friend Silas' family's hut. Their friendship outshines everything. They are together and far away from their evil father - Yet one morning everything is turned upside down and suddenly their fate from home is brought to Norway, which has fatal consequences for both brothers.
