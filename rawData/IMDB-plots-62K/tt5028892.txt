11-year-old Mickey House is no longer a child. But who is he? He doesn't know. He's friendless. He doesn't understand his mother. He hates what's happening to his body. Reality and imagination come together in a toxic mix. Events escalate to extremes... at home and at school. Mickey has to find the strength within him to put a stop to what's begun. Where will his encounter with his own maturing body take him? Growing up... not for kids.
