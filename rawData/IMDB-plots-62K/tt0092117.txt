A small but growing Texas town, filled with strange and musical characters, celebrates its sesquicentennial and converge on a local parade and talent show.
David Byrne of Talking Heads fame visits a typical (and fictional) Texas town, on the eve of the town's celebration of the state's sesquicentennial. He meets various colorful local characters, most notably Lewis Fyne, a big-hearted bachelor in search of matrimony.
A much larger than life portrayal of "those wacky Texans" when entertainment hits the masses. . David Byrne knows about as much about Texas as I do of England. David always bring a rare insight to the sub-conscious! Thank you VH1C for bringing this wonderful film back to us!
