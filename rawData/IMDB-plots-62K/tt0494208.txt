Pediatrician by day, single mom by night, SARAH invites her estranged husband, PETE, back to their suburban home for the Holidays on one condition: he must reconcile with their daughters before she agrees to finalize a trial separation with divorce.
Respectively a pediatrician and soon to be retired commercial pilot, Sarah and Pete Murphy, who have two grown daughters Lisa and Holly, have been legally separated for ten years. They lead different lives, Pete who lives hard, cavorts around the world and did cheat on Sarah when they were together, while Sarah is more focused on family. Since the separation which the girls mistakenly believe is a full divorce, Pete has been out of his family's life, he who has made little effort to keep in touch, while Lisa in particular has purposefully excluded her father from her life, including not inviting him to her wedding to longtime fianc√© and family friend/neighbor Andrew Priester, and not having told him that they are having a baby. Sarah has not condoned Lisa's attitude, but also has done nothing to try and change it. Just prior to Thanksgiving, Pete is forced to return to Chicago to meet with Sarah when he makes the decision to remarry, to a woman named Kelly, who is young enough to be his daughter and with who he is moving permanently to the Bahamas, and thus requires Sarah to sign the final divorce papers. He expects solely to be in Chicago long enough to see Sarah and the girls to tell them the news and to invite them to the wedding. Out of circumstance, Pete is forced to stay in Chicago longer than he anticipated. In finding out about all that has and is going on in Sarah and the girls' lives, Pete may take stock of his relationships with them and if time will have healed all wounds in their family.
