Based on a true story, 'Tot altijd' introduces us to a band of friends in the eighties, who spend their days enjoying their youth and turbulent (love) life. Mario Verstraete (Koen De Graeve) rushes into marriage with Sofie (An Miller), who gives birth to their son Milan. His secret admirer Lynn (Lotte Pinoy) takes a step back. A few years later, Mario and Sofie divorce and the group fragments. Thomas (Geert Van Rampelberg), a recent medicine graduate and Mario's closest friend, gets stuck between a rock and a hard place when he diagnoses Mario with MS (Multiple Sclerosis). Though not a fatal disease, it slowly consumes the patient's bodily functions and - in some cases - their minds. Mario becomes the leading spokesman for the action group Waardig Sterven ("Dignified Death") in support of the Belgian legalisation of euthanasia. Thomas does everything in his power to avoid losing his best friend, but also can't stand the sight of his continued degeneration. The film follows the journey of both Thomas and Mario, as the latter asks: "will you help me, when the time comes?"
