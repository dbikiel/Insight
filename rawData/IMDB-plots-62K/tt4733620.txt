The young Pedro Malasartes (Jesuita Barbosa) is kind of a good-willed vagrant who travels from town to town playing tricks in gullible strangers in order to have a meal or something that he needs at the moment. Being very clever , he draws the attention of Death (Júlio Barbosa) who is willing to take a vacation and wants him to fill in it's place . He will have to deal also with Próspero (Milhem Cortáz) , a guy that will do anything to avoid the happy cheater from wooing his pretty young sister Áurea (Isis Valverde) .
