A blowhard who poses as a railroad executive (but is really just a $30-a-week clerk) catches a young bride and then drives her family's finances to the brink of ruin.
Aubrey Piper ( Ford Sterling ), a mere clerk at the offices of the Pennsylvania Railroad, poses as an important executive to his sweetheart, Amy Fisher ( Lois Wilson ), by blustering, bullying, and showing off continually. Though all the members of her family are contemptuous of Piper, Amy marries him; 3 months later she is fully aware of his faults. To help his son Joe continue work on his invention (a rust-preventing paint), Pop Fisher gives him the money saved for the mortgage and shortly afterward dies of a stroke. Aubrey wins a Ford in a raffle; and while taking it out for a spin, he knocks down a traffic policeman; Joe is forced to pay his fine with the mortgage money. Realizing the tragedy he has brought upon Amy's family, Aubrey visits the directors of a steel company and by bluffing sells them Joe's invention. The coup creates a furor in the Fisher household, happy at last that the "show off" has redeemed himself.
In Philadelphia, flashy dresser Aubrey shows up for work at the Pennsylvania Railroad office, late. He's a big show-off for a $30-a-week clerk. He buys a ticket for the office car raffle. In the park he proposes to Amy telling her he's a department head with a staff of 30. That night at Amy's, Aubrey gets a free meal. Amy's parents get the truth about Aubrey from Clara, Joe's girl. Their son Joe has just invented a new type of rust-proofing paint but can't sell it. Pop gives Joe $1000, the mortgage money for the house, to develop the invention... Aubrey, now Amy's husband, wins the raffle but wrecks the car, almost running over a policeman. His court fine is $1000. Joe pays it with the mortgage money. A man from the bank comes to foreclose on the property...
