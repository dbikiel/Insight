Overwhelmed widower Seth Webster is searching for a housekeeper to help him with his unruly six year old twin sons. "Mrs. Miracle" mysteriously appears and quickly becomes an irreplaceable nanny, chef, friend... and matchmaker.
Since his wife's fatal car crash, Seth Webster is frazzled with his architect career and caring for his darling, rascal twin sons Jason and Judd (6), whose unrelenting mischief chased every housekeeper the agency sent in no time. Mrs. Merkle turns up mysteriously, but is so good at minding boys and house that her name gets corrupted into Mrs. Miracle. Sneakily, she also pulls miraculous strings to make sure recluse Seth dates again with another reluctant dater, Reba Maxwell, also to the kids' liking, through their school's Christmas show.
