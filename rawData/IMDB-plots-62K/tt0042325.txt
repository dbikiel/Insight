Beauregard Bottomley is a eccentric but unemployed genius who confidently believes he knows everything and is able to back up his claim. After being rejected in a job interview by the pompous Burnbridge Waters, president of a soap company, because he has a wry sense of humor, the idiosyncratic scholar decides to go on the company's popular quiz show. Contestants go on dressed in costumes symbolizing their academic specialty, so he dresses as the encyclopedia. After answering his alloted amount of questions, Bottomley challenges the show's brash, wise-cracking emcee to allow him to come back the following week to gamble double or nothing on another question. Sensing a ratings advantage, the dismissive Waters allows him to do so. the weekly ratings and soap sales go through the roof, but as Bottomly confidently answers every question put to him, it becomes apparent to Waters that the genius intends to bankrupt him of his 40 million dollars. He then recruits bright and beautiful Flame O'Neill to become involved with the confirmed bachelor and discover his Achilles heel.
