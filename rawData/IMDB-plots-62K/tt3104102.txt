A group of movie professionals go into a studio to, over a single day, read / test/ count / live the story of 'The Silly Ones and The Stupid Ones'. Sitting around a table and following the directions of the director, the actors show us the evolution of the creating process and how the characters through the trials, indications, lighting or props, that at first were just a story captured on a script becomes a film, in cinema, the great optical illusion, the visual lies that allows us to enjoy the stories we see on the screen.
Second feature by Roberto Caston, whose movie Ander competed in the Panorama Section at Berlin in 2009. Mario, Paula, Miguel and Lourdes run into one another while looking (some more than others) for a way out of a life they don't like. The situation forces them to make decisions, listening either to their hearts or to the fear of change. They are accompanied in the process by the film's director, played by Roberto Alamo.
