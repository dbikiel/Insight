When Jeff unexpectedly shows up on Ben's doorstep at 2am, the two buddies immediately fall into each other's arms. Since their college days, they've taken very different paths. Jeff is still the wild man, a serial lover, an artist and eternal vagabond who's never stopped roaming the world. As for Ben, he settled down with chilled-out and wonderful Anna; they bought a small and comfortable house in the suburbs and started trying to make a baby. But this quiet life is disrupted by the whirlwind that is Jeff, especially when he takes Ben to a wild party, from which they return at dawn, having made a booze decision that is about to turn all of their lives upside down. Witnessed by Lily and Monica, their sexy party hosts, Ben and Jeff's project looks much scarier in the hangover light of day... but neither has the guts to be the wimp who pulls out!
