In the impoverished southern Dutch province of Limburg, the bond between a former mine worker and his only son is put to the test as the latter takes it upon himself to pay his father's debts to a local gangster.
Lei, descendant of an unemployed coal miner, is an aimless man in his fifties, living a hand to mouth existence. When Lei's son Jeffrey discovers that Lei has a long-drawn debt with Vester, a charismatic crime boss, he does what every loving son would do: He reckons his father's problems as his own.
