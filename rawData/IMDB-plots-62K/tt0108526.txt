Captain New Eyes travels back in time in what is presumably the Late Cretaceous Period. He feeds the four dinosaurs named Rex, Elsa, Dweeb, and Woog his Brain Grain cereal, which makes them intelligent, nonviolent, and gentle. They travel via spaceship to the twenty-first century where they befriend a street-smart and tough-talking, but secretly soft-hearted boy named Louie, and a wealthy, but neglected girl named Cecilia from the wrong side of the tracks. They get rooked into performing in a demented circus run by the scientist's evil brother named Professor Screw Eyes who has twisted plans for the dinosaurs.
