This is the story of four jewel thieves on the run who decide to hole up with a hillbilly couple until the search for them slackens off.
A gang of four thieves, having stolen over a million dollars worth of gems, are driving through the remote hill roads of the Carolinas when their jeep runs out of gas. A local moonshiner and his wife offer the strangers a place to stay until they can get help, but the thieves soon take advantage of their hosts. Both the moonshiner's young wife and his supposed hidden fortune prove to be irresistable temptations for the fugitives, but will their greed and jealousy prove to be their downfall?
