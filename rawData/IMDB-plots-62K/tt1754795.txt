A story that focuses on the problematic relationship between Paul Marseul, owner of a prestigious vineyard in Saint Emilion and his son, Martin, who works with him on the family estate.

He dreams of a son who is more talented, more charismatic . . . and more in line with his own aspirations. Things deteriorate as Paul's trusted manager Francois is dying of cancer. When Francois' son Philip, also in the wine business, returns from California to look after his father, Paul sees Philip as his ideal son and turns away from his own flesh and blood.
Directed by Gilles Legrand, You Will Be My Son stars Niels Arestrup as Paul de Marseul, a prestigious wine-maker and owner of a renowned chateau and vineyard in Saint-Émilion, whom is disheartened by the notion of his son Martin (Lorànt Deutsch) taking over the family business. Martin does not seem to have inherited the qualities that Paul esteems in a wine-maker: persistence, creative insight and technical prowess matched with passion for the job and the product, and Paul frequently reminds him of this, whether explicitly or in subtle gestures. When Philippe (Nicolas Bridet) appears at the vineyard, Paul leaps at the chance to name him as his successor, neglecting the wishes of his own son. The tension in this familial triangle comes to a head when an unexpected event changes everything.Like a fine wine, this drama is full-bodied and complex and provides a fascinating look at the matter of the transmission of knowledge, heritage and tradition in the world of wine.
