Two fraternity pledges travel to a sleazy bar in search of a stripper for their college friends, unaware it is occupied by vampires.
Two fraternity pledges go to a sleazy bar looking for strippers to entertain their college friends. They have problems with transportation, Biker gangs, and worst of all, the staff of the bar, all of whom seem to be vampires, with Grace Jones playing the head vampire.
In Kansas, the friends Keith and AJ are trying to join the best fraternity in the university. Their pledge is conditioned to the presence of a stripper to entertain the veteran's members of the fraternity. They need transportation to go to the city to hire a stripper, so they invite the boring Duncanto go with them in his car. They arrive in a bar called "After Dark Club" and sooner they realize that the place is a nest of vampires,leaded by Katrina.
Keith [Chris Makepeace] and AJ [Robert Rusler] offer to provide a stripper for their college initiation party, so they go downtown to employ one. What they find is a part of the city that, after dark, is overrun by a group of vampires from another planet. Katrina [Grace Jones] gets AJ and rips his throat and graphically laps his blood). Keith spends the rest of the night trying to escape while also trying to figure out the identity of the waitress Amaretto [Deedee Pfeiffer] helping him (she says she knows him from grade school). Finally, Keith and Amaretto manage to escape up a manhole cover in the sunlight. AJ, stuck down in the dark sewers, swears his love for Keith and says he'll reform and get a graveyard shift job.
