A classic Bible story from the book of Daniel is brought to life by Big Idea Productions. Rack, Shack, and Benny work in a factory that makes chocolate bunnies, owned by Nebbie K. Nezzer (a la King Nebecanezzer). His obsession with the bunnies leads him to build a giant one. Anyone who doesn't bow down and worship is fed to the furnace, where the "bad bunnies" go. While most employees worship it, Rack, Shack, and Benny cling to their Christian faith.
