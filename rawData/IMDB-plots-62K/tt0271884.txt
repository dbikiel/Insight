A husband and wife, dissatisfied with their banal suburban existence, take a walk on the wild side one night with a couple they meet at the Zebra Lounge.
The upper middle class Wendy Barnet and Alan Barnet are married with children and live in the suburbs. Alan is disputing a promotion with his co-worker Neil Bradley (Vincent Corazza) but his relationship with Wendy is boring. They decide to buy a swingers magazine and contact an attractive couple to rekindle their sex life. The couple Louise and Jack Bauer schedule a date with them at the Zebra Lounge and they go to a place where they swap wives. Wendy and Alan feel satisfied with the encounter but Louise and Jack want to meet them again. Soon they find how persistent Jack is.
Alan and Wendy Barnet, a quiet, upper-middle-class yuppie couple, are stuck in rut romantically. After some soul-searching, they decide to spice up their sex life by placing an ad in a swingers magazine. From among the many replies they receive, they arrange a date with Jack and Louise Bauer, a young couple who seem similar to the Barnets. After a very enoyable evening of spouse-swapping, the Barnets feel they've broken out of their rut and are ready to return to a life of monogamy. The Bauers, unfortunately, aren't quite so ready to let go.
