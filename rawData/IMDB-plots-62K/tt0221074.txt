During the holidays at a ski resort in Utah run by a Native American tribe, the overworked manager and a widowed woman from the big city overcome mistaken identities and intrusive guests in their pursuit of romance.
A classic comedy of mistaken identity and romance set during the holiday season at a ski resort that is owned and operated by a Native American Nation. Shot on location at The Sundance Resort in Utah, this is the first contemporary romantic comedy to feature an almost entirely American Indian cast. The film was featured at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival.
A romantic comedy with Christmas Cheer, "Christmas in the Clouds" is set at a tribally owned and operated ski resort in the Southwest. Memorably quirky characters make their way through plot lines full of mistaken identities and frustrated bingo dreams.
