A man enters a roadside diner run by a young woman and claims he is being chased by murderers.
Beth, a young woman who owns a restaurant close by an abandoned highway, shelters Barry, a young man who arrives at her door hungry and wounded. Soon, a group of men appears. Barry claims that they are after him. The handsome leader of the group tells Beth a different story...
As day dawns on a quiet beachside community, Beth (Radha Mitchell) opens her remote roadside diner for another day of business. Enter her first customer, Jack (Barry Watson), a disheveled twenty-something who appears very frightened. He claims that three angry surfers are chasing him--but when the surfers finally arrive at the restaurant, they don't appear to be dangerous. The trio claims that Jack is a lunatic with a dangerous case of road rage, while Jack tells Beth that the surfers want to kill him. With no one to go to for advice or support, Beth finds herself in the middle of a situation that can potentially put her in great danger.
