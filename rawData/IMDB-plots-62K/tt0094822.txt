Poor gigolo tries to frame his rich mature mistress, but gets tangled in his own wiles.
Antonio dotes on his mute brother and promises him a better life, symbolized by Baton Rouge. He's a gigolo who moves in with Isabel, wealthy and separated from her husband. She has nightmares of rape in her own bed, so Antonio encourages her to consult a psychiatrist; they end up in the office of Ana, a young doctor. As part of the exam, Ana visits Isabel where she catches Antonio pocketing a blank check Isabel has signed. Ana pushes him into an elaborate scheme to blackmail Isabel, making it seem she has killed her husband during a nightmare. All goes smoothly until Antonio sees the body: it's not the man he thought was Isabel's husband. In whose game is he a pawn?
