A high school in a small-town in Mississippi prepares for its first integrated senior prom.
In 1997, Academy Award winning actor, Morgan Freeman, who lives in the Charleston, Mississippi community, offered to fund the first-ever integrated Senior Prom in the history of Charleston's one high school. His offer was ignored. In 2008, Morgan offered again... the East Tallahatchie County School Board accepted. In this town of 2,300 people, its high school of 415 black and white students has, to this day, always had separate proms: one black, one white prom. Our film follows the Charleston High senior class of 2008 preparing and attending their historic, first integrated prom, in the context of strong emotions, traditions, and conflict inherent in race relations in the community, and in the deep south. Some of the white parents maintained their whites-only prom.
In 2008, actor Morgan Freeman offers to pay for the first integrated prom in Charleston, Mississippi. This documentary presents interviews with students, staff and parents about the decision to hold a racially integrated prom. The students and staff seem prepared and even eager to hold the prom but many in the community aren't. Proms in the past had been organized by the parents rather than the school authorities and one group of parents decides to hold a whites only prom anyways. Students are interviewed about their views on integration, dating and the views of their parents.
