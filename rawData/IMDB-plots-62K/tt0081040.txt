A fine day in the life of a fly presented completely from the fly's point of view. A fine day until something dreary happens, that is.
On a clear, yet fateful autumnal morning, a little and restless fly still numb from dawn's chill, flies around in the woods in search of heat and, hopefully, a treat.

Without delay, the fly storms inside the house anxious to discover its riches, nevertheless, is she welcome?
