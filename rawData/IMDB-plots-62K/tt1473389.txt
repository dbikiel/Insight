Maximilien ChÃªne has big gambling losses; his disgusted wife tosses him out. A corporate client offers an impossible job: help the boss's nephew close a major deal without the nephew knowing he's being coached. If Max succeeds, he'll be paid enough to settle his debts. The nephew, Patrick, is a milquetoast, pushed around by staff, agreeable to a fault, and unable to express his interest in Vanessa, a colleague. How can he, in a week, learn the skills to negotiate with tough-minded Chinese? Max devises a strategy: he offers to help Patrick gain Vanessa's attention. Within a few days, a complication arises. What chance does Max have? Can the coach improvise?
