A man loves a woman, whose family does not believe in love.
Rising from present India in the conflicting era of shining modernity and deep-rooted archaic traditions in the era of big city versus small towns, comes a love story sealed with an impossible fate. The story of the bold Bablu and the bratty Dimpy. Will Bablu and Dimpys love blossom under the terror of a brutal clan and the violent landscape it is set against. Heropanti is the story of today's youth, and the coming of age of its conflicting protagonists.
