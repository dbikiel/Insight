Bhuvan Shome is a lonely widower, a proud old man and a strict disciplinarian. Looking back on the trodden path, strewn with staunch determination and drab attitudes, Bhuvan Shome, a throughtly unenchanted man, seeks escape in a holiday. Off to duck shooting in Gujarat, Bhuvan Shome little ralises that the rejuvenation adventure would hurl him into a world so apart that he would find it the most joyful experience in his life. His new world consists of simple, uninitiated village folks, a bullock-cart drive, marauding buffalo and Gouri. In Gouri, Bhuvan Shome finds a fresh, throbbing pulse in a dying world. And suddenly everything lights up, perhaps heightening his sense of isolation, in his new found joy.
Diligent, hard-working, and honest Bhuvan Shome (Utpal Dutt) is both hated, and respected in his profession. His outlook on life is narrow and strick. This outlook is changed forever when he visits a village, in a bullock-cart, to go hunting to shoot ducks.
