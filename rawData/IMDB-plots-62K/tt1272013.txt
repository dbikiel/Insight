Emilio, a shy, not too brilliant pupil at a humble local secondary school, has always harbored a secret love for Natalia, the cutest, brightest girl in the class. On the last day of the school year, when he finally decides to declare his love, Natalia is awarded a scholarship to study Medicine at Oxford. It would seem that all is lost for Emilio, but his drop-out school-pals are not ready to throw in the towel. After faking qualifications and scholarships, this band of brainless nuts land in Oxford, causing havoc in the normally peaceful campus existence.
In Spain, the eighteen year-old Emilio has been in love for Natalia since he was five; however, he has a series of physical problems and is too shy to declare his love for Natalia. His best friends are the outcast José Manuel Flash Sanchez Expósito a.k.a. Flash, who is blind but acts like a normal teenager; Wheels, who is paraplegic and sexist; Goat, who is a hacker and drug dealer; and Corneto, who is a womanizer. When Emilio is ready to tell Natalia that he loves her, she is informed that she has been accepted with scholarship in Medicine in the Oxford University. Goat uses his hacker abilities to falsify documentation and scholarships in the Medicine course in Oxford for the five friends. When Emilio meets Natalia, his friends decide to help him to get closer to Natalia; however, for each plan that they plot to get Emilio closer to Natalia, the result is always a great disaster.
