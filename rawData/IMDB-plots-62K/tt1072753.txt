Two best friends compete to be the best man at their childhood friend's wedding.
Waynesville, Pennsylvania's most beloved citizen, Alex Grant, has hired filmmaker Fred Anderton to document his wedding from engagement to honeymoon. Fred is determined to turn this simple wedding video into a cinematic masterpiece. But Fred gets bored shooting wedding planning details and digs for drama to create his opus. So when the groom agonizes over choosing his best man, Fred orchestrates a cutthroat contest between Alex's closest friends, high school teachers Andrew Walter and Jack Reynolds.The men compete fiercely in everything from bumper cars to the game of Clue to win points in categories like "Humanity," "Intelligence," and "Joie de Vivre," while Alex keeps score on an elaborate chart. The contest captures the imagination of the town as Jack and Andrew compete to become the mentor of a troubled student, crash the ladies-only bridal shower, and launch into singing duel at the mayor's fund raiser. Waynesville is ripped in two as townsfolk take sides. Even the priest wants in on the action, volunteering to announce the best man winner during the wedding ceremony itself. It's a dream come true for Fred as the stakes continue to rise, but for Andrew and Jack, the pressure becomes unbearable as they explode into a fist fight at the rehearsal dinner. The day of the wedding arrives, and three questions remain: Who will be the best man? Will the town survive this ugly civil war? And will Fred's film create buzz on the festival circuit and earn theatrical release?
