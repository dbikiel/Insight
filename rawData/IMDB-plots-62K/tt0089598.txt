In this erotic comedy, Miranda is the landlady of a small country tavern who is looking for a husband, and tries out a variety of men for size.
With her husband still missing since WWII, the voluptuous innkeeper, Miranda, runs the business by herself, somewhere in a small late-1940s town outside Venice. Refusing to remarry, Miranda insists on waiting for her lost husband to return; however, hers is an idle promise because, in the meantime, she enjoys keeping an affair with the young transporter, Berto, under the watchful eye of Tony, her secret admirer. With an ample supply of lovers, Miranda consoles herself for her loss by searching for the perfect substitute, and without any inhibition, she will submit them--one for each season--to her erotic trials, over a period of one year. But, sooner or later, the search will end, and then, who will be the lucky one standing next to Miranda, the beautiful and juicy prize, at the church?
