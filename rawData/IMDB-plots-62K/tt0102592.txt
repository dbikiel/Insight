A small town police chief awaits the arrival of a gang of killers.
In Los Angeles, after a violent drug rip-off, the Los Angeles Police Department detectives find the identity of the trio - the sadistic I.Q. of 150 and college graduate Lenny "Pluto" Franklyn; his not so bright buddy in San Quentin Ray Malcolm; and his girlfriend Fantasia. Their further investigation indicates that the criminals are fleeing to Star City, Arkanas, and LAPD detective Dud Cole and his partner John McFeely contact the local Chief of Police Dale 'Hurricane' Dixon and they head to the little town. The yokel family man Dale, who is used to resolve domestic issues, is fascinated with the chance to participate of a manhunt and befriends the two detectives. But when he sees the picture of Fantasia, he recognizes her as Lila Walker and is haunted by his past, hiding a secret about Lila Walker.
After an "LA drugs deal" leads to blood and carnage, the perpetrators end up in small town Arkansas where the leader Ray contacts his ex-girlfriend. Two LA Detectives ensue and soon find themselves out of sorts in the sticks. Chief Dale 'Hurricane' Dixon sees his chance to impress and get dream a move to the big city but his hicks-ville approach leads to mockery and derision. Keeping important information from the two officers he tries to play clever and capture the criminals himself. 'Classic' neo-noir, tough is tough but evil is evil.
With the assistance of two Los Angeles Police Department detectives, Star City, Arkansas Police Chief Dale "Hurricane" Dixon prepares to take on several criminals heading to his small town after a crime-filled road trip from California.
