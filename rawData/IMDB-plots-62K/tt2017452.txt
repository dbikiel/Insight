A young college student thinks that something sinister is going on in her new dorm room.
What happened in Room 205? Why has no one lived there for over a year? Katrin couldn't care less: the 19-year-old student has landed a room in the dorm, and that means freedom! Freedom from home and her over-protective father. The semester is just beginning, and it's time to make new friends, go to parties, have sex, and, of course, go to classes. Then, strange things happen in her room, and she begins to understand why no one wanted to move into Room 205 before her.
