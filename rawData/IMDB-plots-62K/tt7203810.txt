It's a music documentary that tells the story of Roy Gurvitz, who created Lost Vagueness, at Glastonbury and who, as legendary founder, Michael Eavis says, reinvigorated the festival. With the decadence of 1920's Berlin, but all in a muddy field. A film of the dark, self-destructive side of creativity and the personal trauma behind it.
The movie tracks the rise of Lost Vagueness at Glastonbury Festival, from when it existed as a little-known ballroom dancing venue on the periphery, to, perhaps, the biggest attraction the festival has ever known. A rumour that Kate Moss and Pete Doherty had wedded in the Lost Vagueness field's Chapel of Love and Loathing brought media column inches and cemented its reputation as the after-hours venue of choice for thousands of festival-goers, who could lose themselves in a decadent whirl of burlesque entertainment and vintage-themed music and dancing. 'Lost in Vagueness' documents events from this heyday - circa 2003-4 - to the demise that gradually occured when Ray Gurvitz's team became involved in corporate parties to fund activities at Glastonbury Festival. Providing a metaphor of how creativity is eventually corrupted by capitalism, the strain of dealing with "thousands of people" at Glastonbury and "paying 500 people on a budget of Â£2,000" started to take its toll. Roy became increasingly disillusioned and difficult to handle and the Lost Vagueness field was disbanded. A group of creative people who previously worked for Lost Vaugness took over the mantle, with the new "naughty" field, Shangri-La, that exists at Glastobury Festival today. With Lost Vagueness, Ray had created a trend in popular culture, even if his venture was no more.
