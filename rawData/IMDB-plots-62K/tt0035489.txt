A werewolf prowls around at night but only kills certain members of one family. It seems like just a coincidence but the investigating Inspector soon finds out that this tradition has gone on for generations and tries to find a link between the werewolf and the family, leading to a frightening conclusion.
Helga Hammond and her brother Oliver Hammond live in an isolated mansion with their staff. There is a legend of a curse in the Hammond family but Helga does not believe it is true. When a woman is murdered and Oliver is attacked in a frozen night, Scotland Yard Detective Robert Curtis and his assistant Christy are assigned to investigate the case. Dr. Jeff Colbert, who is the Hammond doctor and friend, becomes the prime suspect of Robert since he does not give any support to the investigation. What is the secret of the Hammond monster?
Robert Curtis, a Scotland Yard police inspector, and Christy, a female detective fascinated with the occult, have their work cut out for them when they investigate the savage attack on Oliver Hammond, a wealthy aristocrat, and Kate, a young nurse. The superstitious butler, Walton, believes that a creature who has menaced the Hammond family for years is on the prowl again. Oliver's sister, Helga, is more skeptical, and so is Dr. Colbert, the family friend and physician. The detectives' search through the Hammonds' gloomy old mansion yields secrets that several persons are desperate to keep hidden.
