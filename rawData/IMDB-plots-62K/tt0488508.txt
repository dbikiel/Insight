Two narratives -- the life cycle of a mother walrus and her calf, and the life of a polar bear and her cubs -- are used to illustrate the harsh realities of existence in the Arctic.
Arctic Tale takes you to the top of the earth and the polar bears ice kingdom. This is a National Geographic film that is narrated by Queen Latifah. The movie follows the beginning lives of a polar bear cub, Nanu, and a walrus pup, Seela. The story takes us along their journey from birth to maturity, eight years later, with all the struggles in-between. We see that the mothers will do anything to protect their young from other predators in this life or death struggle. The biggest threat for Nanu and Seela is surviving the harsh, changing habitat climate of the north which delivers the possibility of not finding food. The ice kingdom which has given them life is literally melting away in front of them. Their future survival depends upon the ice. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy)
