This is a story about a successful young R&amp;B singer that has an unlikely homecoming when his father, the bishop, becomes ill.
A young singer turns his back on God and his father's church when tragedy strikes. He returns years later to find the once powerful congregation in disarray. With his childhood friend creating a "new vision" for the church, he is forced to deal with family turmoil, career suicide, and relationship issues that send him on a collision course with redemption or destruction.
As a teenager, David Taylor was studying to become a minister. However, after his mother suddenly dies and his pastor father arrives late, he accuses his father of caring more about others than his mother. As a result he runs away and eventually becomes a hot young R&amp;B performer and leads a very self-indulgent lifestyle. However, when his father becomes ill he returns home to find his father's church in disarray as well as his former best friend, with whom he was studying with for the ministry, now in charge and seemingly caring more about his own image than the welfare of the church or its congregation. Now David must find a way to save the church as well as his own soul.
