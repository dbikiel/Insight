A candid portrayal of Lily Dale, a spiritualist community in upstate New York, where most of the town's residents are registered Mediums who regularly give spiritual readings to visitors through alleged communication with the deceased.
NO ONE DIES IN LILY DALE is a documentary film that captures the journeys of a diverse set of visitors making a pilgrimage to an off-the-beaten-path town, with hopes to connect, heal, find answers, and get closure with deceased loved ones. Experience first-hand the different stories of personal loss as they collide and unfold in rural upstate New York. Lily Dale boasts the largest spiritualist community in the world, filled with 40 registered Mediums who communicate with those whom have passed over into the "other side".

Ron is trying to make peace with his son's death and the spirits that haunt him. Susan Hinrichs, a born-again Evangelic Christian, questions her religious faith in hopes of communicating with her son Scotty, who died from a deteriorating form of cancer at the age of 18. Widow Rebekah Fabricius, journeys from Ohio trying to connect with her late partner who had a tragic death.
