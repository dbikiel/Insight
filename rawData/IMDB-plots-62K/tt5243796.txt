A feature documentary on the life and work of filmmaker, Richard Linklater. Produced and Directed by Louis Black (founder of SXSW Festivals and the Austin Chronicle) and Karen Bernstein (Emmy and Grammy Award winning documentary filmmaker), this is an unusual look at a fiercely independent style of filmmaking that arose from Austin, Texas in the 1980s/ early 90's and how Linklater's films, Slacker, Dazed and Confused, Waking Life and Boyhood, sparked a low budget, in your own backyard movement in this country and around the world.
