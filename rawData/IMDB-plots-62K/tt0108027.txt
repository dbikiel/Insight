A period musical comedy set in a quiet Prague quarter at the end of the fifties. Using the western plot device of the "man from nowhere" a generation gap story unfolds of changing social climate. The action is driven by the character of a young man named Baby (Martin Dejdar) who causes a local rebellion by bringing rock'n'roll to a Communist neighborhood raised on swing.
