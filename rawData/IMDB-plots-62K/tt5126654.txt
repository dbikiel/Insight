A woman and man compete in an unusual race for mayor when gender roles magically reverse.
When mayoral candidate Amanda (Collette Wolfe - INTERSTELLAR, HOT TUB TIME MACHINE) uses a magic mirror to reverse the gender roles in her small town, she gains the upper hand on her womanizing opponent, Bret (Sam Huntington - SUPERMAN RETURNS, SULLY). As each experiences life in the other's shoes, they must decide which reality they prefer before they're stuck in the flipped world forever.
