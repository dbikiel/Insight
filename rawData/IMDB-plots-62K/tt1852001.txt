A young Parisian woman of Caribbean descent returns to her native island of Guadeloupe looking for the father she has never known.
A single mother in Paris, Bernadette tried hard to give her daughters everything. She is thrilled when her eldest, Elza, the first college graduate in the family, completes her master's degree. However, Elza breaks her mother's heart by running away to their native Guadeloupe in search of a distant childhood memory: the father she barely remembers. This feature debut by writer/director Mariette Monpierre offers an unusual insider's view of lush island culture as she captures the passion and contradictions of this family.
