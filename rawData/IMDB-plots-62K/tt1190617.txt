An anti-American filmmaker who's out to abolish the July Fourth holiday is visited by three ghosts who try to change his perception of the country.
At a July 4 barbecue, gramps tells the kids the story of Michael Malone, a documentary filmmaker and Michael Moore look-alike who hates America and wants to abolish July 4th. He refuses to celebrate with his nephew Josh, who's shipping out soon to the Middle East. That night, Michel has a vision of his hero, JFK, who predicts that three ghosts will visit Michael. Sure enough, General Patton, George Washington, and country music star Trace Adkins visit Michael show him the fruits of patriotism, just wars, and pacifism. Meanwhile, Arab terrorists want Malone to help them with a propaganda film. Is he the next Leni Riefenstahl or will he see the light?
On the July 4th, a group of children listens to the story of the documentary filmmaker Michael Malone told by their grandfather at a family barbecue. Michael wants to abolish the July 4th and does not celebrate the date and refuses to visit his family. Three clumsy Afghan terrorists consider that Michael Malone hates the United States of America and posing of producers, they invite him to make a feature with the intention of helping them to recruit new terrorists. During the night, Michael is visited by JFK that advises that he will be visited by three spirits. Soon General Patton, George Washington and the Angel of Death visit him trying to show him what would happen to the United States if pacifism prevails over war.
