A mad scientist seeks to mingle human blood with that of an ape, and resorts to kidnapping women for his experiments.
In 19th Century Paris, the maniacal Dr. Mirakle abducts young women and injects them with ape blood in an attempt to prove ape-human kinship. He constantly meets failure as the abducted women die. Medical student Pierre Dupin discovers what Mirakle is doing too late to prevent the abduction of his girlfriend Camille. Now he desperately tries to enlist the help of the police to get her back.
Young women in Paris are being killed and Pierre Dupin thinks he has the solution to the crimes. He and his fianc√©e, Camille L'Espanaye, had recently visited a carnival side show where Dr. Mirakle showed off his large ape. Mirakle has been taking women off the street to conduct experiments he hopes will prove that man evolved from apes. Mirakle takes a liking to the pretty Camille and uses his gigantic ape to kidnap her. Pierre manages with considerable difficulty to convince the police that he is telling them the truth and they set off to the Rue Morgue to stop the evil doctor and rescue his bride-to-be.
