Passion: of people for the land and sea, of corporations for riches, and of men and women for each other. Vicente and Abigail run a banana plantation in Limon Province, on the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica. Abigail's half-sister Irene, about whom Abigail knew nothing, comes to introduce herself. She is 21 and beautiful. Meanwhile, banana prices fall, threatening the plantation's finances. An oil company works with the government to get off-shore drilling rights, over local objection. Vicente is at the center of each cross-current. Will he fall for Irene, can he save the plantation, will he sell out to corporate offers? What of the coast: can its beauty be saved?
A middle-aged woman (Escribano) living a comfortable life with her slightly older foreign-born husband (Perrugor√≠a) on a finca welcomes a younger half-sister (Zapata) she never knew into her life. Intrigue, passion, and deception disturb the harmony of the household while an American oil company seeks to move operations into the diverse beach community of Puerto Viejo, Costa Rica and the locals must decide on the benefits and costs of the endeavor.
