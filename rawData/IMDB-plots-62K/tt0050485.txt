A lawman becomes a Deputy in a town where he suspects the friend he had to kill in self defense, was framed for murder.
Steve Burden is a former lawman released for bringing in too many wanted men dead. The aging Sheriff of El Solito wants Steve for his Deputy and Steve takes the job knowing the last outlaw he killed was framed in El Solito. Looking for the man that framed him it appears that Rice Martin who controls El Solito is his man and Steve is quickly in trouble when Martin sends a man to kill him.
