Retrospective on science fiction and fantasy films from early efforts like George Melies' "A Trip to the Moon" (1902) to George Lucas' "Star Wars" (1977).
Television's Bock Rogers, Gil Gerard, narrates this nostalgic, but not-to-be-taken-seriously retrospective of science fiction and science fantasy films from silent classics like George Melies' "A Trip to the Moon" and Fritz Lang's "Metropolis" to contemporary box-office smashes like "Star Trek" The Motion Picture" and the "Star Wars" series. Speial attention is given to low budget 1950s camp B-film cult classics like "Queen of Outer Space" and "Cat Women of the Moon" in addition to A budget films like George Pal's "The War of the Worlds" and "Forbidden Planet." The affectionate documentary is divided into chapter headings in which various elements of the genre are examined in a lighthearted but affectionate manner.
Gil Gerard hosts this look at sci-fi movies. Clips include A Trip to the Moon (1902), Metropolis (1926), Phantom Empire (1935), Things to Come (1936), Flash Gordon (1936), The War of the Worlds (1953), Invaders From Mars (1953), The Thing From Another World (1951), Barbarella, Queen of the Galaxy (1968) Star Trek The Motion Picture (1979) and Star Wars (1977)
