Hagan is rustling horses lead by a white stallion from a Government restricted area. Young Danny Saunders captures the horse who then kills Hagen's mare. Hagen needs the white stallion and when Danny is hurt during the beaking of the horse, his mother gives the horse to Hagan. Upset, Danny runs away to be with the horse. His mother chases after him and they are both made prisoners when they see Hagan's rustling operation.
A modern-day western set in Utah featuring a wild stallion, a kid, his widowed mother, a veterinarian who'd like to marry the widow and a dyed-in-the-wool villain, posing as a surveyor but actually out to capture every wild hoss in Utah even though the pursuit and capture of wild horses has become an illegal practice in Utah. Sounds rather pedestrian, especially with Fred Sears as the director and Carey as the lead, but the result, as photographed by Lester White and a bevy of stuntmen whose skills with handling animals and vehicles are done without the aid of special effects, is far beyond the usual expectations from producer Wallace MacDonald and Columbia in the 50's. The always-good Dorothy Patrick and the always-real-and-good Billy Gray serve to move it up a notch.
