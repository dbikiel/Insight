The pious St. Anthony is tormented by visions of seductive women.
In this powerful and highly poetic dramatisation of Saint Anthony's grave tribulations--one of Georges Méliès' earliest attempts to approach an explicitly religious topic--the pious ascetic seeks refuge in a deep and dank cavern to flee from the demons' incessant torments. However, new and formidable adversaries in the shape of scantily-clad nubile maidens repeatedly disrupt the saint's prayers, who turns to his guardian angel to save his soul that is, clearly, in peril. Will the grievous temptations of the flesh ever stop?
