A documentary chronicling the background to, and history of, the Vietnam War.
Produced at the height of the Vietnam War, Emile de Antonio's Oscar-nominated 1968 documentary chronicles the war's historical roots. With palpable outrage, De Antonio (Point of Order, Underground) assembles period interviews with journalists, politicians, and key military personnel and international newsreel and archival footage to create a scathing chronicle of America's escalating involvement in this divisive conflict. The savage and horrific images speak for themselves in perhaps the most controversial film of de Antonio's career, and the film he cites as his personal favorite.
This Oscar-nominated documentary looks at those who were opposed to American involvement in the war in Vietnam. Released in 1968 as public opposition to U.S. involvement was still rising, several prominent Americans are interviewed. The history of the Vietnam conflict is explained and provides a stark contrast of the government view of the time that U.S. involvement in this war was part of an overall fight against the spread of communism. The horrors of war are presented giving a stark representation of what the war was like, particularly for the Vietnamese who had to live through it every day,
