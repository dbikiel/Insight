In 2005, 20-year-old Ryan Ferguson was convicted and sentenced to 40 years in prison for a crime he did not commit, causing his father, Bill, to embark on a 10-year campaign to prove Ryan's innocence.
Bill Ferguson, an army man born and raised in Missouri, has never been one to back away from a challenge: traveling across the world pretending to be a welder, teaching at an aboriginal school in Australia, and spending an inordinate amount of time with his two kids, Kelly and Ryan. But after Ryan is charged and convicted for a murder based on somebody else's dream, Bill takes on a challenger that he never could have anticipated: the American judicial system.
