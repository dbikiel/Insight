The Bumsteads are trying to leave on their vacation but one thing after another (including Radcliffe stealing their luggage) is stopping them.
The Bumstead family is all set to take a long-awaited vacation, but office trickery, counterfeiters, a petty thief, the loss of their suitcases and other complications, including Daisy getting impounded, keep delaying them. But Blondie takes charge and they wind up with an extra week of vacation time.
