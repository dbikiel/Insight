A teenage martial artist is thrown into a world of theft and risky behavior while investigating the death of his older brother.
When Ethan's older brother Greg is found dead, the police rule the case a suicide, but Ethan suspects foul play stemming from Greg's recent involvement with a martial arts team called the Scorpions. Ethan is also accomplished at martial arts, and he determines to join the Scorpions as a means of learning what really happened to Greg.
When Ethan, a young Karate student, believes his brother Greg was killed by members of a rival Karate dojo, he sets out to infiltrate the group to prove it. His investigations turn up more than he had bargained for and lead to a challenge to a competition against his old dojo.
