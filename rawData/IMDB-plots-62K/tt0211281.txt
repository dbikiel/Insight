A loosely based story on the Brothers Grimm fairy tale, Town Musicians of Bremen about a donkey, a dog, a cat, and a rooster and their master Troubadour.
Young Troubadour and his friends - Donkey, Dog, Cat and Rooster - come to the royal castle for a performance. At the end of the performance, the young man, having seen the Princess close, immediately falls in love with her, but at the Pyramid number the actors fail, and the Princess's father, the King, impolitely expels the actors from the castle courtyard. On the way, travelers stumble upon a hut of robbers and Chieftain, who conceived an attack on the royal motorcade.
