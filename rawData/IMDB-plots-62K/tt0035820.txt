Donald drives too fast and blows out a tire. Of course, with this clown, changing it is not a simple operation. First he has to fight the jack, then the heavily patched inner tube, then the adhesive on the patch, then the pump, then the hassle of putting the tire back together. Finally, he's all done, and ... well, let's just say he's not going anywhere too quickly.
