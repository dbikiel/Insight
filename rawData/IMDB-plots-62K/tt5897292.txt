It has been a few months since Pietro Zinni's gang got caught in the Sopox production laboratory and each of them locked up in different jails. From Regina Coeli jail, Pietro keeps warning the authorities a fool synthesized nerve gas and he is ready to make a killing, but no one takes him seriously. So he puts in for a transfer to Rebibbia to meet Murena, who has useful information to intercept the murderer. After which, Pietro wants to get the gang of university researchers back together: the perennially unemployed (or detained) most brilliant minds around.
