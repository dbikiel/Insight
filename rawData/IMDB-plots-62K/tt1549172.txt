Born into a world of numbers, an oppressed zero discovers that through determination, courage, and love, nothing can be truly something.
In a world that judges people by their number, Zero faces constant prejudice and persecution. He walks a lonely path until a chance encounter changes his life forever: he meets a female zero. Together they prove that through determination, courage, and love, nothing can be truly something.
Much like an identity, somewhere in a world where its citizens are born with a number on them, the inborn qualities of an individual are characterised by his particular and personal digit. As a result, a nine is very much revered, whereas a five is a pure mediocrity, and, god forbid, a vulgar and disgraceful zero is worthy to be marginalised as a pariah of society. But sometimes, even a zero can be a ten.
