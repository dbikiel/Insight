Attracted but also frightened by her sexuality, a teenage girl undergoes a brief therapy with a warm, humorous and competent psychotherapist.
At age 17, Eglantine is troubled by a number of things. Her argumentative parents comprise an absentee and philandering father and an overprotective, occasionally alcoholic mother. Her boyfriend SÃ©bastien is a couple of years older; he's ready, but she isn't. Frequent furtive visits to her therapist help her to see that these issues are not 'problems', but 'difficulties', which she has the strength to overcome.
