A hopelessly romantic physiotherapist meets a handsome young Rajput prince who is the complete opposite of her and engaged to someone else.
Khoobsurat is a quirky, modern romantic comedy about what happens when a vibrant, hopelessly romantic physiotherapist meets handsome young Rajput prince who is the complete opposite of her and is engaged to someone else. It is a battle of values between two individually crazy families one that encourages discipline and self - restraint versus the other, which is all for spontaneity and open mindedness. Khoobsurat looks at universal themes: being able to love and respect yourself; and having to fight for the things you really want.
