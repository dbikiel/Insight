A colorful and foul-mouthed feature musical comedy. A film about a frizzy-haired, pink-cheeked outcast named Spork who is trying to navigate her way through the annals of junior high. When a school dance show provides a chance for Spork to show up a mean girls gang, her trailer-park neighbor steps up to coach her with some "booty-poppin" moves. Featuring a vintage '90s soundtrack (that includes 2-Live Crew, JJ Fad's "SuperSonic," Dimples T's "Get It Girl"), a score by Casey James and the Staypuft Kid; and extended school hall dance sequences, Spork is a film about standing out and fitting in.
