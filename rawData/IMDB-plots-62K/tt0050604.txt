Adventures of Ivan the Fool and humpbacked horse in the world of kind magical creatures and cruel people.
The old peasant has three sons: the two elders, Danilo and Gavrilo, are considered smart, and the youngest, Ivan, is considered a fool. One day, a father sends his sons to find out who tramples the wheat at night. The older brothers decide to hide in a haystack where they quickly fall asleep. Meanwhile, Ivan sits under a birch and plays the pipe. Suddenly he sees a white mare with a long golden mane descend from the sky. Ivan manages to jump the mare on his back, and she starts to jump. Finally, tired, the mare asks Ivan to let her go and in return gives him two beautiful golden-maned horses and a Humpbacked Horse, who will be Ivan's best friend.
