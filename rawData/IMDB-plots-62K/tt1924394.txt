Narrowly avoiding jail, new dad Robbie vows to turn over a new leaf. A visit to a whisky distillery inspires him and his mates to seek a way out of their hopeless lives.
This bitter sweet comedy follows protagonist Robbie as he sneaks into the maternity hospital to visit his young girlfriend Leonie and hold his newborn son Luke for the first time. Overwhelmed by the moment, he swears that Luke will not have the same tragic life he has had. Escaping a prison sentence by the skin of his teeth, he's given one last chance......While serving a community service order, he meets Rhino, Albert and Mo who, like him, find it impossible to find work because of their criminal records. Little did Robbie imagine how turning to drink might change their lives - not cheap fortified wine, but the best malt whiskies in the world. Will it be 'slopping out' for the next twenty years, or a new future with 'Uisge Beatha' the 'Water of Life?' Only the angels know........
Before a lenient Glasgow City Court Judge, the young offender, Robbie, promises to go straight--not only for his own good but also for the sake of his pregnant partner, Leonie. Sentenced to community service along with the equally young lawbreakers, Mo, Rhino, and Albert, this motley crew of misfits supervised by the kindly whiskey connoisseur, Harry, will be introduced to the fragrant world of scotch, where, unexpectedly, Robbie finds out that he has a nose for expensive malts. But, can this newfound hobby get Robbie off the hook to turn his life around?
