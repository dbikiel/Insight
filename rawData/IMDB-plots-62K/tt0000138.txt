At a solitary cheap inn, a distant traveller overcome with fatigue has a close encounter with the supernatural.
A weary traveler stops at an inn along the way to get a good night's sleep, but his rest is interrupted by odd happenings when he gets to his room--beds vanishing and re-appearing, candles exploding, pants flying through the air and his shoes walking away by themselves.
In the dead of night, a distant traveller overcome with fatigue, arrives at a solitary cheap inn, hoping to get some rest to start fresh in the morning. However, as the weary man prepares for sleep, all the inanimate objects in the room, including his pith helmet and his pair of boots, seem to have a mind of their own, determined to torment their owner. Is there an escape from this close encounter with the supernatural?
