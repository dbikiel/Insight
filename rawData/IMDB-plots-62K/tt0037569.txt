A narrator tells the story of how the Western pioneers (all being Goofy lookalikes) are travelling in covered wagons across the frontier. They run into some Indians (who are also Goofy lookalikes) and battle breaks out between them. Suddenly a tornado comes by and sweeps up the covered wagons, dropping them into various states such as "Wash", "Organ", and "Californy."
