An unpolished racketeer, whose racket is finding heirs for unclaimed fortunes, affects ethics and tea-drinking manners to win back the sweetheart who now works for his seemingly upright competitor.
Unscrupulous investigator of lost heirs Jimmy Corrigan loses his love Joan Martin to apparently upright competitor James Wallingham. He counters by adding a veneer of respectability to his own operation. Meanwhile he exposes Wallingham for a fraud.
Jimmy Corrigan is an unpolished, uneducated con man whose specialty is finding missing recipients for the fortunes of millionaires who have died intestate. Sometimes fraud enters into it, but Jimmy is moderately successful with his staff of ill-educated henchmen; that is, until his 'Girl Friday' Joan Martin is recruited by his arch rival, the well-mannered but oily Charles Wallingham, whose well-appointed and fashionable office includes an impeccable staff of beautiful and educated secretaries. When Jimmy discovers that Joan left him for Wallinham's classy veneer, he vows to do whatever he has to in order to win her back - even if it means becoming a "gent."
