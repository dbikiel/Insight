A human mimicking giant bug survived Mimic (1997) and is killing humans and stalking a woman, who's bug/biology school teacher in NYC.
When a cockroach-spread plague threatened to decimate the child population of New York City in the original Mimic, biologist Susan Tyler and her research associates developed a crossbreed species of insect, the "Judas Breed" and introduced them into the environment, where they were to spread a toxin, lethal to the cockroaches. The plan worked until the bugs evolved to mimic their next prey.....humans! Just when they were all thought to be dead, the giant Judas bugs are back, and this time they've mutated to take on human form!
