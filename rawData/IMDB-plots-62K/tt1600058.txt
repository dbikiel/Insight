A figure skater turns to teaching after her partner suffers a debilitating injury, and later summons the courage to get back out on the ice by teaming with a rebellious speed-skater with a bad reputation.
In "The Cutting Edge: Fire &amp; Ice," Francia Raisa reprises her role as Alejandra "Alex" Delgado in film franchise, whose figure skating career came to an abrupt halt after her partner (on and off the ice) became injured. As their love affair cooled, a heart-broken Alex stopped competing and turned to teaching. Enter James Van Fehr, the smoldering bad boy of speed skating, who has had fiery Alex in his sights as a skating partner ever since he was banned from speed skating. There aren't many girls who say no to James Alex may well be the first. However, James pushes her buttons, challenging her like no one else and her fighting spirit returns. She agrees to be his partner and they begin a grueling practice regimen fueled (and occasionally derailed) by their own tempestuous relationship which heats up as they get closer to competition. But will their passion destroy Alex's chance to bring home the gold again?
