When British Alex arrives alone in Sydney, he meets handsome American Taylor who takes him out for drinks. Next morning, Alex awakes completely wasted and sleeping with a girl on the floor as Taylor takes a Polaroid picture of them. Since Alex is going to Byron to meet his girlfriend Sophie, Taylor offers him a lift. In Bryon, Sophie introduces Taylor to her friend Ingrid, and the two couples plan to travel together; however, when Ingrid does not meet them the next morning, Taylor explains she decided to travel with a girlfriend instead. Along the journey, Alex realizes that Taylor is a manipulative psychopath obsessed with Sophie, but Sophie believes Alex is just jealous without reason and does not give credence to his fears. When a car accident in a lonely area leaves Alex with a head wound, Taylor ups his game, intriguing one against the other. When Sophie later receives a text from Alex saying he's left, she accepts a ride from Taylor but eventually learns the truth about her new friend.
