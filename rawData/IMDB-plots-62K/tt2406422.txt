A profile of six pilgrims taking the Camino De Santiago pilgrimage.
Walking the Camino: Six Ways to Santiago follows various pilgrims, from ages three to 73, as they attempt to cross an entire country on foot - with only a backpack, a pair of boots and an open mind. Driven by an inexplicable calling and a grand sense of adventure, each pilgrim throws themselves heart and soul into their physical trek to Santiago de Compostela, and most importantly, their personal journey to themselves. Whatever their motivation, no one can predict just how their paths will unfold, what personal demons or angels they will face, or what transformations they will undergo by trail's end. Called "A brilliant documentary" by Martin Sheen, this multiple award-winning film has been selling out screenings worldwide.
