A disgraced paleontologist struggling to raise her son is tipped off to a groundbreaking dig site in the Badlands by a recovering meth addict, but his tie to the cartel threatens to bury them both under the weight of their criminal pasts.
"Valley of Bones" is a nail-biting adventure thriller set in the oil-rich Badlands of western North Dakota. Anna, a single mother and paleontologist, and McCoy, a meth-addicted oil worker, form an unlikely bond as they both struggle to make amends for their criminal pasts. Their hopes lay in the form of a monumental T. rex fossil, the discovery potentially worth millions. Anna needs this once-in-a-lifetime find to set both her career and her relationship with her son back on track. McCoy needs the money to pay off his debts to a local cartel boss and to save his own young daughter's life. With their motivations over the bones pulling them in opposite directions, can Anna and McCoy trust one another or will they soon turn into adversaries themselves?
