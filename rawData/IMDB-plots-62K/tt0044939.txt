Dave Jennings is a successful, self-made man in the business world, but he can't control his son, Gus, who is primarily a brat fond of throwing temper-tantrums and misbehaving. Dan enrolls Gus in a school where Lydia Marble is a teacher. Lydia's influence works wonders on Gus, and also Dan, who falls in love with her. When Dan's long-departed wife, Joyce. shows up to shake him down for money, Dan gladly pays her a fortune to divorce him and leave him and Gus in peace and, eventually, Lydia.
