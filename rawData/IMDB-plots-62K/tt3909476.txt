A love story with unpredictable twists and turns between perception and reality, love and its complications and the faults of human nature, Apo Erota (Lovestruck) is a romantic tale with a twist.
Antonis is a firefighter. The story begins two days before his wedding to Natassa, a nurse, when Anna, his ex-girlfriend, visits him out of the blue. The old flame is still going strong. Antonis will not bail out of his wedding with Natassa, even though Anna is obviously very keen to restart the relationship. Things get more complicated when Antonis starts a "double life" in his own home. What will happen when Anna shares the same space with Natassa?
