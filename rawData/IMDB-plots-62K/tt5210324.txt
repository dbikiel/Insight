An employee about to retire and the young man who is to take over, share five journeys in the work place, an enormous empty warehouse where apparently nothing ever happens. The time going by, marked by a maladjusted clock, the uncomfortable silence between the two people forced to share a space, the inactivity in the warehouse - where paradoxically there is a minute anthill with frantic activity - the despair of waiting, the generational conflict between the two characters, the weight of a great lie... All this will be building an indomitable tie between the two, something that will crate a permanent union: the conscience of losers.
