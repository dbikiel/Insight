Not a feature film, but several episodes of the TV series Rocky Jones, Space Ranger (1954) edited together and released as a feature.
In this compilation of episodes from "Rocky Jones, Space Ranger", Rocky and his co-pilot Winky are sent into space to try to foil a gang of space pirates who have been preying on cargo ships sent out by the United Worlds, and who have also captured Rocky's girlfriend, Vena. Rocky is aided by a new invention, "cold light", which, in much the same way as heat causes mirages to appear in the desert, causes an object to become so cold that it disappears!
