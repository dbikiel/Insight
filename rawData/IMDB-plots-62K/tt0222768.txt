Atop a wonderful central pedestal, a happy clown puts the finishing touches on a William Tell's incomplete model, assembling the mannequin limb by limb with the intention of shooting a target off of its head with a potent crossbow.
Atop a wonderful central pedestal, a happy clown puts the finishing touches on a William Tell's incomplete model, assembling the mannequin limb by limb with the intention of shooting a target off of its head with a potent, one-shot crossbow. But suddenly, the inanimate statue which has a completely different opinion on the matter comes to life and decides to defend himself--and much to the clown's disappointment--when he turns his back to see who hit him, the joker is, of course, lifeless again. Is this prank the result of the clown's vivid imagination or is the Swiss hero's statue alive after all?
The scene opens in an artist's studio where the unfinished statue of William Tell stands upon a pedestal. A clown appears and sticks a clay arm and clay head on the statue, thus completing it. He places a large brick on top of the head to make it stick. When he turns his back the statue turns into a living representation of William Tell, and seizing the brick from the top of his head, hits the clown a heavy blow upon the back. After some very strange happenings, the mysterious William Tell finally vanishes in a cloud of smoke, and the clown jumps up from the floor and makes his exit in a very ludicrous manner.
