A mockumentary that follows Ray Shoesmith, a Melbourne hitman who is simultaneously ruthless and caring, likeable and volatile. 'Filmed' by his media student neighbour for a university assignment, Ray is under contract to kill a low life of the Melbourne underworld when a more tempting offer is made...
The Magician follows charismatic, yet volatile hitman Ray Shoesmith (Ryan) around Melbourne while he is being filmed by a friend and neighbour. As he goes about his chilling business - threatening violence and in some cases making good on those threats - the camera continues to roll, fuelled by offbeat conversation, dark humour and emotional crises.
