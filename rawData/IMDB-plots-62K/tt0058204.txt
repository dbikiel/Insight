Jay Menlow is jilted at the altar by his fiancée, Cynthia Hampton,and his pal, Ross Kingsley, persuades him to use his reserved-in-advance accommodations at the Boca Roca Hotel (honeymooners only) in lieu of the doomed honeymoon, and Ross will accompany him to bolster him up and Cynthia will soon beg to have him back. Ross' gesture is not quite as altruistic as it appears. He has been fooling around with his employer's girlfriend, Sherry Nugent and figures that a brief exodus from New York and his boss, Mr. Sampson. But Mr. Sampson shows up, followed by his ever-loving wife who has decided to find out just what goes on on her husband "business" trips. Complications, including schemes to avoid the hotel's "no bachelors allowed" rule also follow.
When Jay Menlow (Robert Morse) breaks up with his fiancée, Cynthia (Anne Helm), just before his wedding, he decides to use his honeymoon accommodations anyway. He takes along Ross Kingsley (Robert Goulet), a bachelor, who was to have been his best man. Their arrival upsets the tropical hotel's management because guests are usually restricted to honeymooning couples. Ross, however, manages to date the hotel's only single girl, Lynn (Nancy Kwan), the social director. Jay, on the other hand, is bored and wants to patch up his quarrel with Cynthia, but Ross manages to intercept their calls to each other and prevent a reconciliation. Complications arise when Rosss boss Sampson arrives at the hotel with a beautiful girl, Sherry (Jill St. John ), followed shortly by Mrs. Sampson (Elvia Allman ) and then Cynthia.
