Real-life cop Sony Grosso turned Hollywood producer hosts a 30th Anniversary special featuring interviews with various persons involved in the making of The French Connection (1971).
We follow Sonny Grosso through the streets of New York and meet a few of the stars and filmmakers of William Friedkin's The French Connection (1971). This is fairly informative compared to most other television specials made by Twentieth Century Fox, mainly because this documentary is not purely for publicity, but rather a look back at some of the best memories of their experiences on the film.
