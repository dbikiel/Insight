Kaala is about the life of Nellai / Tirunelveli based Tamils who live in large number in Mumbai.
Union minister Haridev called as "Hari Dhadha" Abhayankar, previously a gangster who had carried out many attacks in Dharavi, tries to evict the people and seize their land. Kaala, the leader of Dharavi, opposes it to protect the area and his people. Hari Dhadha's failed attempts to kill Kaala in order to take control of the area leads to the death of Kaala's wife and older son instead. And to take revenge on him and protect the people of Dharavi, Kaala decides to fight him.
Kaala (aka) Karikaalan is a representative of the people living in Dharavi, a big slum in Mumbai. When a political leader tries to grab the land they are living in, Kaala rises to the occasion and takes his people on a journey to resist the politician's plans, like a true leader.
