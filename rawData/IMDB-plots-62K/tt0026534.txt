Two brothers, a police officer and a boxing promoter, vie for the affections of a lovely young woman.
The family consists of Pat, the cop, Mike the fireman, Danny the boxing promoter and Ma. Pat wants Danny to get a real job, because most of his fighters end up in Polookaville and Pat wants to marry Lucille. This means that he will leave the family and Danny needs a income to help support Ma. But Danny believes he has the fighter named Carbarn who will bring him fortune and is going with that. But Lucille meets Danny on the road one day and it means trouble for the family as she does not love Pat, but loves Danny.
