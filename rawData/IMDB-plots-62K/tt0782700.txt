A gripping and intense thriller about honour, loyalty, and the courage to fight for what you believe.
Two young sisters act against their family's "code of honour" and their lives become a deadly nightmare. Two bouncers at a popular club are attacked by criminals igniting total war. An award winning journalist presses charges of spousal abuse against her husband only to become a hated pariah amongst their common colleagues. But what none of their aggressors could have foreseen is the enormous will to fight and prevail that is awaked in the hearts of those threatened one time too many.
