Inspector Holloway (Patrick Wymark) investigates a series of bizarre murders where a doll bearing the victim's likeness is left at the scene. All four of the victims knew each other, initially from their war service, and now the string quartet they formed, but they are all killed in different ways. The dolls are traced to a Mrs. Von Sturm (Margaret Johnston), an avid doll collector, who lives with her adult son Mark (Sir John Standing). Holloway feels he has found the motive when he learns the four men were part of a commission that discredited Von Sturm's husband at the end of World War II. Proving who is responsible for the killings is more difficult.
