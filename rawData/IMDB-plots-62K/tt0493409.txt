Two small time drug-dealers cross paths with a female-assassin, a monster hunter, a Japanese swordsman and even the Devil himself at a gentlemen's club housing murderous she-demons.
Quinn Taylor and his friend Nick are on their way back from Mexico with a load of Spanish Fly to sell in the States. They stop at a gentlemen's club called The Devil's Den and decide to test out their product on the unsuspecting women there. Only, these women aren't really human, and the two men find themselves in a very fatal position. Also tossed in are a female-assassin on the hunt for Quinn, a monster hunter who just happened to stumble into everything, a Japanese swordsman who doesn't really exist and even Satan himself who have to deal with the situation once all hell breaks loose
Some people sell their souls outright, and some people just chip away at them, piecemeal, until they wake up one day and realize there's nothing left. And some people, like Quinn Taylor, are so busy selling a line of bull&amp;*^% to everyone who will listen, that only the most extreme life altering event reminds them that they have a soul at all. During a routine Spanish Fly smuggling trip back from Mexico, on a dark lonely road in the middle of the night, Quinn and his buddy Nick decide to test their 'product' on the lovely ladies of the Devil's Den gentlemen's club. Only these ladies are a lot less human, and a lot more dangerous than anything these small time not-so-illegal-drug dealers are capable of handling. Throw in a sexy female assassin who has been sent to put an end to Quinn's rampant infidelity spree, an armed to the teeth monster hunter who has come to the right place at the wrong time, and a legendary Japanese swordsman who doesn't really exist, and even the Devil himself isn't ready for what happens when all hell actually does break loose. In the vein of Kill Bill and From Dusk Til Dawn; party all night in the Devil's Den.
