Set in 1944, Valiant (Ewan McGregor) is a woodland pigeon who wants to become a great hero someday. When he hears they are hiring recruits for the Royal Homing Pigeon Service, he immediately sets out for London. On the way, he meets a smelly, but friendly pigeon named Bugsy (Ricky Gervais), who joins him, mainly to get away from clients he cheated in a game of find-the pebble, and helps him sign up for the war.
At the height of World War II, Valiant, a tiny but brave and utterly common wood pigeon, thirsts to do his part by enlisting in the elite Royal Homing Pigeon Service to serve Britain. However, carrying encoded messages across the vast and perilous English Channel is an extremely dangerous job, especially now that the fearsome General Von Talon and his deadly squadron of falcons patrol the area. Under those circumstances and with Mercury, the seasoned dove-courier, captured behind the enemy lines, it's up to Valiant and the courageous Squad F to save the day. Is Valiant a war-hero in the making?
The animated comedy tells the story of a lowly wood pigeon named Valiant, who overcomes his small size to become a hero in Great Britain's Royal Air Force Homing Pigeon Service during World War II. The RHPS advanced the Allied cause by flying vital messages about enemy movements across the English Channel, while evading brutal attacks by the enemy's Falcon Brigade.
