Nora Taylor has $37,000,00 but thinks every man she meets prefers her bankbook figure to her own, and that include her current fianc√©, Paul Chevron, who has $48,000,000 of his own. Paul goes to Brazil to play some polo, and Nora follows along. There, she meets and falls for Roberto Santos, whom she thinks has no money, who is really overjoyed when he discovers she has a lot of money. This depresses her somewhat. But, this being a big-budget MGM film, which means that the two top-billed characters have to end up together, winds up with Metro-plot-218 that says Roberto has a few potatoes (or bananas) of his own and is just pleased to find out she isn't a gold digger after his money. The rich get richer and the poor need not apply.
