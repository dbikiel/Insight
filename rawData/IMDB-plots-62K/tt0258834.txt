In Omaha, Nebraska, three buddies--all sub-par French majors--start a business that should not succeed on the vast Great Plains: a bicycle courier service. Through absurd adventures, personal challenges, and while charging only two dollars per 120-mile delivery, their business becomes a resounding success. But will success ruin their friendship? And what's a teriyaki cupcake? And who is "Doody" Judy? Writer/Director Jeremy Lerman brings us this film-festival favorite, a comedy with "The subtly warped style of Bottle Rocket or Swingers."
