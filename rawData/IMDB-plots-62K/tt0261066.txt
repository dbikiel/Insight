Miguel Pinero's creative and turbulent life was cut short at the age of forty. A Tony Award nominee who did time at Sing-Sing, a volatile urban poet whose work is recognized as a precursor to rap and hip-hop, and a writer of hit TV shows.
"Pi単ero" tells the story of the explosive life of a Latino icon, the poet-playwright-actor Miguel Pi単ero, whose urban poetry is recognized as a pre-cursor to rap and hip-hop. After doing time in hard-core Sing-Sing for petty thefts and drug dealing, Pi単ero's prison experiences developed into the 1974 Tony-nominated play Short Eyes. The resulting notoriety and fame was too much for the Latino bad-boy genius who retreated to the darker corners of New York City.
Hot-head Miguel Pi単ero, son of wealthy Portorican immigrants in New York, still is drawn to drugs and petty crime, ending up in jail. Precisely a play written in Sing Sing, Short Eyes, in an innovating style, swift and sharp, yet rhythmic, is his way to fame. Still he never conforms or fits in US society, which he criticizes in 'revolutionary' terms.
