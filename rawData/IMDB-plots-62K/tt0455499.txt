Jon and Garfield visit the United Kingdom, where a case of mistaken cat identity finds Garfield ruling over a castle. His reign is soon jeopardized by the nefarious Lord Dargis, who has designs on the estate.
Garfield (Bill Murray) is back and this time he and his canine sidekick Odie follow their owner, Jon Arbuckle (Breckin Meyer), to England, the U.K. may never recover, as Garfield is mistaken for a look-alike, regal cat who has inherited a castle. Garfield savors the royal treatment afforded by his loyal four-legged subjects, but his reign is in jeopardy. The evil nefarious stubborn Lord Dargis (Sir Billy Connolly) is determined to do away with Garfield, so he can turn the castle into a resort. Garfield's bigger, better, more perfect world is soon turned upside down in this tale of two kitties.
Jon Arbuckle (Breckin Meyer) goes to London to be with Liz (Jennifer Love Hewitt), and Odie and Garfield (Bill Murray) sneak along with him. Meanwhile, a deceased Queen gives everything to her cat Prince XII (Tim Curry). Her only heir, Lord Dargis (Sir Billy Connolly), becomes jealous and tries to kill Prince. Garfield and Odie sneaks out to the streets of London. Lord Dargis throws Prince in the river and he ends up in the sewer of London. Smithee the butler (Ian Abercrombie) believes he found Prince, but it was really Garfield, and Jon finds Odie with Prince, and mistakes him for Garfield. Now, the castle animals must keep Garfield safe and keep him thinking he's royal to save their lives.
