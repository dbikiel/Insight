Many interested parties are after the loot from a factory payroll heist but the mobster who hid it has amnesia after undergoing experimental brain surgery in the prison hospital.
A thug is convicted and undergoes experimental brain surgery to remove the criminal element in his brain. The operation wipes out all memories of his past life, including where he stashed the loot. He is abducted by his gang and they try to beat the truth out of him. His memories return in the form of weird dreams, and he and his old girlfriend track down the clues to find the money.
Columbia's first 3-D production (released originally in Sepiatone) and also the first 3-D feature from a major studio---"Bwana Devil" was an indie production distributed by United Artists---has a story featuring gangster Steve Rawley who, while in jail on a robbery charge, undergoes an experimental brain operation designed to eradicate his criminal tendencies. He loses his memory and is kidnapped by his old cronies who want to get their hands on the hidden loot for which he has been serving time. He eventually, through a series of wild dreams, recovers his memory before the climax in an eerily-lit amusement park, highlighted by a wild chase on and over a roller coaster.
