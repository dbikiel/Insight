A man who loves an aspiring opera singer is prepared to sacrifice everything to help her with her career, even though he knows she doesn't love him.
Margaret Howard, a singer from a once-wealthy family but now penniless, becomes the protégé of Steve Corelli, wealthy nightclub owner and gambler. He falls in love with her. Corelli is an ardent music lover and hopes to see Margaret singing on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera. To make this possible for her, Corelli sacrifices everything, to the extent of plunging himself into bankruptcy. But just as he has secured a Metropolitan contract for her, she also announces her intentions to marry Philip Cameron.
