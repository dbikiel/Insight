There's a crisis in Rhymeland! All the Rhymies (the characters from Nursery Rhymes) are disappearing! Gordon Goose, son of Mother Goose, and Little Bo Peep set off to find them.
When Mother Goose is kidnapped, her son, Gordon, teams up with Little Bo Peep to search for her. When they realize that she has been taken into the "Real World", the characters in her rhymes start to disappear.
