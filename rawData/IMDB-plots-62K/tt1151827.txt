1892. Dachau, Bavaria. A family of thieves end up in prison. One of the sons dream of emigrating to America.
At the beginning of the twentieth century, one man stirred Bavarian emotions: the legendary Robber Kneißl. While the authorities make the capture of the alleged felon their top priority, the common people love their "Hias" (Kneißl): He is one of them and he defies every injustice done to him, right down to the end. For when a man like him has no chance to live upright in his own country, he'll do anything to begin anew, with his one and only - in America. It's a race against time, and the stakes are nothing less than life and death.
