This is a movie where three entirely different stories are told though dancing. Words are not used and the style of dancing is different for each part. Kelly is a clown in the 'Circus'; a Marine in 'Ring Around the Rosy'; and Sinbad in 'Sinbad the Sailor'.
Three separate and individual stories are told exclusively through dance and mime. In "Circus", a clown in a street circus is in love with one of the other troupe members with who he often performs. She is unaware of his feelings as she is in turn in love with the circus' high wire walker. The clown does the only thing he knows to compete against the wire walker and win her heart. In "Ring Around the Rosy", a women's bracelet acts as the common bond between several male/female liaisons. The bracelet is primarily a symbol of allure between the men and women involved. It is initially given by a husband to his wife as an anniversary gift. As the bracelet gets passed from man to woman to man to woman and so on, it eventually makes its way full circle back to the husband. What he decides to do with it will decide the fate of his marriage. In "Sinbad the Sailor", Sinbad, a sailor on shore in the Middle East, comes into possession of a magical lamp containing a young genie. Sinbad, not knowing what to do with the genie, initially just wants the genie to go away. He eventually learns the genie's powers, which allows the two to have some fantastical adventures.
