November, 1999, Margaret Cho is home in San Francisco at the Warfield Theater. Cho structures her monologue loosely on her professional life's trajectory: doing stand-up, cast in an ABC-TV sitcom, losing 30 pounds in two weeks for the part, the show's cancellation, a descent into booze, pills, and self-loathing, and a resurrection into her own voice, her own shape, and being the one she wants. Along the way we visit Karl Langerfeld in jail, a lesbian cruise ship, a TV Guide photo shoot, a hospital, bars, and her family's Polk Street bookshop. Takes on being a fag hag, speeding up felatio, casual daily racism, and her mother's phone messages highlight a scabrous, brilliant performance.
