Pepe Nietnagel's bunch's pranks make their school a logical choice for the ministry of education to reassign an elite teacher to. The choice falls on overqualified Dr. Peter Bach, who seems wasted on but is happy in a tiny Alpine village. When it burns down, he accepts moving with his orphaned cousin Jan, who feels his foxy new temp teacher Julia Schumann could provide the female touch their 'bachelor household' lacks. Pepe's class takes to unconventional Peter, but the brass considers him a collaborator. A merciless battle of wit and deceit ensues.
