Once upon a time, a group of children venture away from their homes and find a castle. Having no idea the castle is owned by an evil witch, the children are all turned into animals after she catches them playing in the gardens. When a prince passes by, he notices what happened and uses his magical sword to free the children from the evil witches spell.
