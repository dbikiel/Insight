The 1960s was the time of Beatles and Rolling Stones, the time of sexual revolution. These events have their echo in Bulgarian English-learning school. The school order provokes a protest of the students due to the narrow-minded teachers.
Back into 60s. While out there, in the West, they are listening to The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, the hippie movement is at its height, pupils in Bulgaria are obliged to be shingled, to wear full-dress uniforms and sing military songs. But for how long? A group of pupils from a language school believe they have to live differently. They are seeking for ways to shake off everything phony, to be candid with each other, to be part of a wider, much more motley and interesting world. Some of them pay a high price, other experience cruel worldly lessons, but they at least made their best to save face.
