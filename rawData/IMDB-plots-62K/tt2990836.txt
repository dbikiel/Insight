A taxi driver who lives in Napoli spend his time on his uncle's car thinking about happiness. His former brother took a road for happiness practicing Buddhism while he is always sad and melancholic. He listens to a radioshow called the art of happiness as a remembering idea of what is the goal of life. Do we have just one life or are we living again and again forever?
Sergio is a cab driver in Napoli. He inherited the car he drives from his still-alive uncle after his brother Alfredo left the country to join a Buddhist monastery in Nepal. The two brothers had, at one point, formed a musical group but Sergio refuses to share his musical gift. He feels keenly the desertion of his older sibling, to the point that he refuses to read a letter he's received from him lately. He spends a rainy night remembering his childhood and sharing his impressions of life with various clients. From their discussions, he will piece out a philosophy of happiness to carry on and find his own place in the sun.
