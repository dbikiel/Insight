A Quaker colony tries to save the giant sequoias from a timber baron.
In 1900, unscrupulous timber baron Jim Fallon plans to take advantage of a new law and make millions off California redwood. Much of the land he hopes to grab has been homesteaded by a Quaker colony, who try to persuade him to spare the giant sequoias...but these are the very trees he wants most. Expert at manipulating others, Fallon finds that other sharks are at his own heels, and forms an unlikely alliance.
Jim Fallon is a big-time lumber man who decides to take advantage of a new Act of Congress that encourages the felling of trees like the big Redwoods in California. Fallon is a wheeler dealer who even manages to convince his men to go with him, even though he hasn't been able to pay them for weeks. When he gets to California, he finds that a group of Quakers have laid claim to the land and have done so primarily to protect the trees. He's particularly interested in Sister Alicia Chadwick and soon reconsiders. He'll have to fight some of his own men however if they're to win the battle.
