As a young man, I came to Vilnius 10 years ago to work with Lithuanian master filmmaker Sharunas Bartas. I was rather naive and inexperienced, I still had to discover what ils the relation between the words "Author" and "Authority". I lived in a corner of his studio, an old wooden house in the middle of the forest, and bits by bits started to get inside his elusive creative process. But the full picture was missing. In order to put things together, I needed to come back.
