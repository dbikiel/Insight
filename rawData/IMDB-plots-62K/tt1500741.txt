A group of friends in Peru walk across the sandy outskirts of Lima in order to pay their respects to a fallen gang member.
Joaquín and his four friends live in "Paraíso", a neighborhood just outside of Lima founded by people who fled terrorist activity in their native Andean towns in the 80s and 90s. They spend their days there, feeling trapped and without prospects, yet with an underlying determination to improve their situation.
