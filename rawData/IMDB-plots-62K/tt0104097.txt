When a mayoral candidate is assassinated in New York, Frank Devlin has more than a professional interest in the case: Devlin and the candidate's father are bitter enemies. The investigation quickly takes a deadly turn when Devlin finds he's the fall guy in an elaborate setup, and is now the prime suspect in the killing. Double-crossed, pursued by both the police and the mob, Devlin must solve the murder before he becomes the next victim of a cover-up that extends to the highest levels of the city's government.
