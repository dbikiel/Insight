A gangster's willful son is sent into hiding over sexual misconduct. Sent far, he unexpectedly takes up with remote Buddhist drummers who slowly but profoundly influence his life.
Hong Kong mob lord Kwan's spoiled-rotten heir Sid is caught having sex with father's 'business partner' Stephen Ma's daughter. To avoid an honor murder, Sid is rushed to the Taiwanese countryside, incognito, with a bodyguard. There Sid decides to transfer his rock drummer ambitions to the reputed local Zen percussion ensemble of master Ah Chiu, who uses music lessons as Buddhist life training. Still, crime connections catch up.
