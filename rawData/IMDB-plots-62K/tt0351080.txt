A guy and a girl play copycat with each other from opposite sides of the street, that is, until a slightly abrupt &amp; uncopyable event occurs.
As thirsty as a sponge, a guy watching indolently the neighbourhood's passers-by, opens a carton of milk. Having gulped down his moo juice to the last drop, he spots a quirky young woman walking on the pavement across the road--and unable to believe his eyes--the man realises that she is willing to play the copycat game. But, is she a mimic or is this her way of saying "I find you interesting"? Either way, whether they like it or not, life's unpredictable nature always gets in the way. Can someone explain how on earth did they get there?
