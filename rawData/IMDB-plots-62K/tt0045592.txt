Washington hostess Sally Adams becomes a Truman-era US ambassador to a European grand duchy.
Boisterous, fun-loving, and popular Washington D.C. hostess Sally Adams is appointed U.S. Ambassador to the Grand Duchy of Lichtenburg, Europe's smallest country. In Lichtenburg, the Duke and Duchess are negotiating a political marriage for their niece, Princess Maria in exchange for a substantial dowry. However, the country is desperate for funds, and turns to the inexperienced ambassador for a much needed U.S. loan. Sally refuses to talk money, that is, until she meets the ultra charming Gen. Cosmo Constantine. Meanwhile, Sally's press attaché Kenneth Gibson falls head over heels for Princess Maria.
Washington appoints a small-minded social butterfly as a U.S. Ambassador in this film adaptation based on the satirical stage musical. When Sally Adams arrives in Lichtenburg, her bright personality charms everyone she meets. She slips her political obligations aside to focus on a budding romance with Cosmo Constantine, the country's foreign minister -- and at the same time, her attaché pursues a relationship with the princess.
