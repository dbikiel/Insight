When corrupt Roman leader Tiberius arrives with a giant army to claim the Silk Road, Huo An and his group of trained warriors teams up with an elite legion of defected Roman soldiers led by General Lucius to maintain the delicate balance of power in the region. To protect his country and his new friends, Huo An gathers the warriors of thirty-six ethnic nations together to fight Tiberius in an incredible epic battle.
Using modern technology, two young archaeologists discover a monumental lost (fictitious) steppe city, with both Chinese inscriptions and Latin, including its name Regum. It originated when captain Huo An and his elite unit of border troops, devoted to keeping the peace between 36 tribes along the ancient Silk Road, are falsely set up as gold smugglers and banished to a windy mountain garrison of 'wild geese fortress', as forced laborers to help rebuild it under the stern provincial prefect's vain, ambitious commander, general Huo Qubing. When a Roman legion arrives from Parthia, its general Lucius duels Huo An in an attempt to avoid massive slaughter, but a sand storm offers the latter occasion to offer a draw and shelter inside, making them friends by circumstance. The Romans provide the engineering skills and extra man power, while the Chinese mobilize the pacified tribes, to finish the near-impossible building task. Lucius was promised help to find his way back to Parthia, but instead his evil-plotting rival Tiberius arrives with a fresh legion, bent on eliminating Lucius and the blind boy under his protection in a crazy plot, and he has traitor allies. Fights and cruelties incur, inside the garrison city and on the field outside, as allies arrive and loyalties challenged.
