Brazzi plays mad Dr. Frankenstein, Dunn is an evil dwarf and Lugosi (no relation to Bela) is a Neanderthal man. Add a monster named Hulk, and some nude women for sexploitation value.
A dwarf befriends a Neanderthal man and plots revenge against a scientist that fired him. Meanwhile the local villagers suspect the scientist of grave robbing and plan a raid on his castle, but little do they know that there is a murderous monster lurking within that is ready to kill anyone who steps foot near his master.
