Youthful tough Johnnie Stone has fallen under the influence of petty crook Frank Wilson, who involves him and robbery and murder using his sister's boyfriend's stolen gun.
Johnnie learns crime from petty thug Frank Wilson. When Wilson kills a pawnbroker with a gun stolen from Johnnie's sister Madge's fiance Fred Burke, Fred goes to Sing Sing's death house. Wilson uses all the pressure can to keep Johnnie silent, even after he and Johnnie themselves wind up in the big house.
Nineteen year old Johnnie Stone grew up in the tough neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen with his supportive older sister, Madge Stone. Rather than look for a legitimate job as Johnnie tells her, Madge knows that he is hanging out with small time hood Frank Wilson, who he's always looked up to as a person seemingly making easy and fast money while never having spent any time behind bars. Frank plays the odds that he will never serve time for his crimes if he uses his head, this theory which he passes along to Johnnie. Conversely, Madge's fianc√©, Fred Burke, a nightwatchman, will be getting a promotion within his company to a managerial position in their new Boston operation, and has managed to secure a job for Johnnie with him in Boston, which Johnnie may not appreciate in rather wanting to continue spending his time with Frank. Johnnie may have a different view when things with Frank start to go wrong, especially when Frank commits murder in one of their crimes, the murder which he is able to pin on someone close to Johnnie. In his own immaturity, Johnnie, who starts to fear for his own life, begins to weigh doing the right thing against his own personal safety, he who may mistakenly believe that Frank will always have his back.
