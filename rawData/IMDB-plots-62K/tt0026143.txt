A woman becomes a successful singer, but can't do as well in love.
Winnie Wharton gets an audition to sing at the Intime nightclub at the urging of Ted "Lucky" Lorimer, and with Tommy Blake as her pianist, she becomes a big hit. Tommy falls in love with her, but because he senses she fell for Lucky, who became her manager, he remains silent. Lucky says he doesn't want to get married, but he actually has his sights on rich socialite Iris Marvin, who rejects him. Feeling that her refusal was because of the difference in their wealth, Lucky opens up a gambling house to get rich. When Iris' brother loses $30,000 gambling, he steals Iris' jewels to pay his debt to Lucky, who is then arrested for robbery when the theft is reported to the police. But Iris' butler, Morse, saw Ronnie steal the jewels and tells Iris, who bails Lucky out and then marries him. Meanwhile, Winnie gave all her money to a crooked lawyer to get Lucky out of jail, but the lawyer skips town so she can't recover the money. When Lucky hears this, he secretly backs a show for Winnie to star in. It's a big success, but tragedy strikes when Ronnie, thinking Lucky is the cause of all his troubles, approaches him with a gun with intent to kill.
