A frontier gambler wins a railroad in a card game, and must keep it going despite attempts to take it away from him.
In a high stakes poker game, Ben Calhoun wins an unfinished railroad. Without knowledge of railroads nor the money to pay the wages due the workers or to buy the needed supplies and equipment, he sets out to finish the line. He must also contend with more wealthy men who seek to get control.
