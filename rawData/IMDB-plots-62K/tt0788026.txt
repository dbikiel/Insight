George 'Beau' Brummel, a penniless but witty London gentleman, maintains a refined lifestyle with his loyal servant, cook Robinson. Only the friendship of the unpopular Hanoverian heir and Prince Regent, George, Prince of Wales, who acclaims Brummel's fashionable invention, dandy-ism, keeps the creditors from his back, even allows him unconditional credit. Alas a triangle with lady Julia and the equally dubious poet Lord Byron ends up costing him the prince's favor, so his debts come bite him with a vengeance.
