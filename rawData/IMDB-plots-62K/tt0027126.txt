A Walt Disney Silly Symphony retelling of the classic fable about a foot race between speedy Max Hare, aka The Blue Streak, and Slow But Sure Toby Tortoise.
Max Hare and Toby Tortoise are having a foot race. Max has much more style, and is generally cocky. He pauses for a short nap, to chat up the bunnies outside a girl's school (and show off in several sports). When he hears the crowd roar for Toby approaching the finish line, he takes off, but a last-minute sprint, and a long neck, give Toby the inevitable victory.
