Too insecure to approach the girl of his dreams, Danny takes a job at the local multiplex where she works.
Danny has found the girl of his dreams, but he's too insecure to make a move. When he lands a job at a local movie theater where she works, he finds out that his first day is her last. After failing miserably at getting her attention, he enlists the help of the chief projectionist, who has watched one too many movies, and no longer sees the difference between film fiction and real life. It's cinema, but not as you know it.
