The story of USSR's first nuclear ballistic submarine, which suffered a malfunction in its nuclear reactor on its maiden voyage in the North Atlantic in 1961. The submarine's crew, led by the unyielding Captain Alexi Vostrikov, races against time to prevent a Chernobyl-like nuclear disaster which threatens not only the lives of his crew, but has the potential to ignite a world war between the super powers.
It's the height of the 1960's Cold War, and Russia launches the K-19, a flagship nuclear submarine. Aboard this submarine are Captain Alexei Vostrikov and popular executive officer Mikhail Polenin. Tension can easily be felt between the two, as they constantly clash, but both share the unwavering patriotism. When the vessel's nuclear reactor system begins to leak, the two men and their crew must become brave countrymen and work together before all is lost.
At the height of the Cold War with both superpowers on edge, the Soviets hastily launch their state-of-the-art but untried nuclear submarine, K-19, despite the objection of the craft's committed commander, Mikhail Polenin. With the uncompromising Captain Alexei Vostrikov in full command of the mission, the K-19 begins its maiden voyage, pushing both the submarine's capabilities and the crew's loyalty to their limits. However, the men are in for a shocking discovery, as the vessel's leaking nuclear reactor threatens to endanger not only their lives but to trigger a devastating World War III. Are the men prepared to put their lives on the line?
