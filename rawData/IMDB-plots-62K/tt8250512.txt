A prince visiting the U.S. falls for a commoner when he helps her. But his mother isn't pleased with the match and tries to prove that the American gal isn't suitable to be a royal bride.
Susanna (Megan Park) gladly accepts help one day from handsome stranger Nate (Jonathan Keltz) at her parents' garden store in small-town Georgia. Sparks between them fly, but when a photo of them gets leaked to the press, Susanna is in for the shock of her life, when Nate is called back home by his mother...for his coronation as King Nathaniel of Cambria.
