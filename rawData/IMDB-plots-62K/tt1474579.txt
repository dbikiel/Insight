Follows the heated struggle between residents, water workers and corporate managers in Highland Park, Michigan to spotlight what many of us take for granted - the right to affordable water.
Follows one of the first water battles playing out in the United States from an environmental justice perspective. Residents of Highland Park, known as the birthplace of the auto-industry, have received high water bills, they have had their water turned off, their homes foreclosed, and are in the midst of a fight to keep their water from becoming privatized. The Water Front follows one woman's struggle to organize a grassroots campaign to keep her home and defend affordable water as a basic human right. The film is an unnerving indication of what is in store for cities around the world facing an impending global water crisis.
