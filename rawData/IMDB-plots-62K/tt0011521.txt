While at an amusement park, two men try to win the heart of a young lady. They compete with each other while attempting to find her runaway dog, and they race to ask her mother's permission to take her up in a hot air balloon.
Harold is spending the day at the amusement park, unfulfilled and alone. He thinks his day has the possibility of looking up when he spots Mildred, the girl of his dreams, on a date at the park with Roy. Harold thinks he can take Mildred away from Roy. Harold does whatever he can to impress Mildred, while putting Roy in a bad light. Ultimately, Mildred, who has two tickets for a romantic hot air balloon ride, says that she will take that ride with whoever can get the approval from her mother to do so first. Harold gets into one misadventure after another in the entire process, which includes being in possession of a stolen purse, which he is unaware belongs to Mildred and which contains the two tickets.
While at an amusement park, trying vainly to forget the girl he has lost, a young man sees the girl with her new boyfriend. When her dog gets loose in the park, both suitors have to help her catch it. Then, the girl's uncle, a balloonist, gives her a pass for two in his balloon, provided that her mother approves. She then offers to take along the first of her admirers who is able to get her mother's consent.
