In a remote and windswept valley somewhere in the rugged landscapes of Iceland, a solitary elderly couple prepares for the forthcoming winter; however, the urge to work in such a feverish haste remains unknown.
In a remote corner of Iceland, winter is coming on. An aging farmer named Hrafn is doing has last chores before leaving with his wife Gróa for a retirement home in the city. Their daughter Lilja will be coming after the weekend to pick them up. She calls her parents, interrupting her dad's lunch. Her mother is napping. The stoic Hrafn wants to make sure she won't come before Monday. What are these last chores?
Hrafn and Gróa's farm is the last one that is still inhabited in a remote and windswept valley somewhere in the rugged landscapes of Iceland. In this harsh and difficult environment, Hrafn slowly begins to realise that the forthcoming winter should rather be dealt with in the safety of a retirement home--and, with this in mind--he will accept his caring daughter's suggestion to return to the city. Before this big leap in the couple's life, there are so many things that need to be done in such a little time; however, Hrafn's urge to work in such a feverish haste remains unknown. Does he know something?
