A castaway is interrogated by Interpol, conquered by an imperialist ship, loses his lone palm tree to greedy loggers, is consoled by a missionary who promptly abandons him, is thoroughly examined by scientists, and harassed by journalists.
This is a peculiar story about the modern Robinson, confronted with the indifference and lack of spirituality of the world, as well as a protest against the destruction of the original nature by civilization. On a tiny island there is nothing but a lone palm and sand. And this is where the lonely Robinson dreamed, dreaming of getting to the mainland. The first ship, flashed away, passed by and did not notice the man waving a yellow scarf. Maybe just did not see? The second one went much closer, but the result is the same. Soon, the little man realizes that civilized people do not need him at all, and if he does, then only for selfish interests. Guests come only to put their flag there, drill an oil well, ask the Robinson to help catch the criminal, cut down a single palm tree.
