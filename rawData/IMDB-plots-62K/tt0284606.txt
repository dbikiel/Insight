Two great stories on forgiveness! "The Grapes of Wrath" features Junior Asparagus as the hapless target of teasing from a bunch of cranky grapes! Junior learns that forgiveness is the best choice, even when people aren't being nice to you! "Larry's Lagoon" is the story of a three hour cruise that takes a turn for the worst when first mate Larry absentmindedly crashes into an uncharted tropical island. Will Skipper Bob be able to forgive Larry for making such a huge blunder?
Two lessons in forgiveness from the Veggie crew: In "The Grapes of Wrath," Junior learns to forgive the Grape family even after they continue teasing him; "Larry's Lagoon" is the story of a ship's crew being marooned on a remote island, and learning to forgive their clumsy first mate (Larry) for accidentally getting them stuck there.
