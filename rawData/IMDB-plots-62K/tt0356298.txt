Nowhere in the world are the grey herons so cheeky as in the city of Amsterdam, The Netherlands. This film is a wildlife documentary that tells the story of the way the grey herons are living in the middle of the city and how they deal with those other creatures namely humans. The documentary shows the relationship between these animals and their sometimes "human lovers", or haters, through one year. Showing the city and their inhabitants in different seasons. The often-humorous solutions the birds find to get the attention and food from the people is cut with the tension from people loving their little ponds where the heron steal the fish. They also have quite a method to walk into bars to get a piece of chicken. The heron tale is a story about two creature's men and bird and how they deal with life in a very crowded city.
