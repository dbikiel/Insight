Buddy goes to Mexico and visits a cantina. He wakes up the patrons from their siesta and there is music and dancing. Pancho (a Wallace Beery caricature), one bad hombre, rides into town with his gang. Pancho shoots up the cantina and wakes the Four Marx Bros. sleeping in a Murphy bed. He shoots the tip off Buddy's banana and Buddy throws the rest of the banana into Pancho's face. Pancho forces Buddy at gunpoint to play the piano and a se√±orita dances. Pancho propositions her and she smacks him so hard he flies out the back door, where a goat butts him and pushes him back in. He comes onto her again and Buddy uses his cello as a bow, shooting Pancho in the butt with a fork. A fight ensues, ending up in a jumbled pile of broken furniture. The two emerge and Pancho says, "I was only foolin', Buddy" (an homage to Beery's role as Butch in "The Big House".
