A young woman is brought home from the hospital with a broken arm and leg to recuperate after being hit by a car. She soon discovers that her loved ones aren't necessarily the best or selfless caregivers for her.
Take Care tells the story of a young woman (played by Leslie Bibb). After being hit by a car, she returns home from the hospital to recover from her injuries. Single, and stuck with a broken arm and leg, she comes to the rude awakening that her friends and family are not as willing to take care of her as she had previously assumed. After a series of mishaps and setbacks, including an altercation with an unfriendly neighbor (Michael Stahl-David) she decides to call upon an ex-boyfriend of hers (Tom Sadoski) whom she nursed through cancer. Given their history, she calls him to come to her aid and to force him to now take care of her. Matters are made more complicated because the ex-boyfriend has a girlfriend whom he has been dating for 2 years.
