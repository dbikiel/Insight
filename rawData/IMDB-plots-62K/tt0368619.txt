Her sister Niki Douka is assigned as her replacement and travels aboard the SS King Alexander to New York to marry the Greek immigrant Prodromos in Chicago. Nikki is a hard worker and works sewing along the trip for the passengers and crew. She becomes a leader of the brides and discovers the scheme of the crook Karabulat from Georgia with the Russian brides.

They travel onboard King Alexander, a ship that does the regular transatlantic passing. All the brides-to-be have a picture and a name of the man they are going to marry. They are sad, leaving their country and family behind, but also apprehensive, trying to figure out their future life. The main characters are NIKH and NORMAN, who have the chance to get to know each other and whose lives are going to be affected by this trip.
