When mobile networks stop functioning due to a solar flare, Vasanth, a geek, tries to restore them. But a deadly bomb will be activated if the connection is resumed.
Four people about their ways are linked to each other on a deadly mission. Mukil (Dinesh) falls in love with Simi (Bindhu Madhavi) who is stuck in a pit hole, with a eighty ton gigantic 'Vasthu' rock under suspension which is ready to fall on her at any time. The only way that Simi can escape from this danger is that, her text message should reach Mukil. Mean time, there is a hyperactive science geek Vasanth (Nakul) who is on his mission to activate a dead mobile network signal and a call taxi driver Raja (Sathish), whose car has a bomb planted by a terrorist outfit waiting to destroy the city, once the mobile network resumes. Does the city escape?
