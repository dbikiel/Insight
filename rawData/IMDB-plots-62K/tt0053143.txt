During World War II, a commander finds himself stuck with a decrepit (and pink) submarine, a con man executive officer, and a group of army nurses.
A submarine newly commissioned is damaged in the opening days of WW II. A captain, looking for a command insists he can get it to a dockyard and captain it. Going slowly to this site, they find a stranded group of Army nurses and must take them aboard. How bad can it get? Trying to get a primer coat on the sub, they have to mix white and red in order to have enough. When forced to flee the dock during an air attack, they find themselves with the world's only Pink submarine, still with 5 women in the tight quarters of a submarine.
The Philippines, December 1941. Lt. Commander Matt Sherman is the captain of USS Sea Tiger, a submarine. While in harbour she is damaged by a Japanese air raid, and is close to being written off as sunk. However the crew manage to refloat her and repair her as best they can. Sherman acquires a supply officer, Lt (j.g.) Nick Holden, a staff officer with no discernible naval experience or talents, except one - he is a master of scavenging parts and supplies. The submarine sets out for Australia for repairs. On the way they stop at a US -held island only to find it deserted, but for five nurses. Things are about to get very complicated.
