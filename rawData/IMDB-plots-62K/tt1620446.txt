The personifications of daytime and nighttime learn to get along.
When Day, a sunny fellow, encounters Night, a stranger of distinctly darker moods, sparks fly! Day and Night are frightened and suspicious of each other at first, and quickly get off on the wrong foot. But as they discover each other's unique qualities--and come to realize that each of them offers a different window onto the same world-the friendship helps both to gain a new perspective.
Different by nature, two complete opposites, the vibrant Day and the gloomy Night meet for the first time ever. This unexpected encounter will start a series of vivid quarrels and silly fights, trying to define who is better. Day has sunny beaches, while on the other hand, Night is adorned by the bright lights. Perhaps a change of perspective will help them see things more clearly.
