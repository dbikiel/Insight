Attenborough narrates the story of a vast island wilderness - ancient forests, pristine rivers and spectacular coastline. Seasons vary from dry heat, strong winds and cold bringing wombats, wallabies and platypus out in daylight.
Tasmania is a vast, island wilderness of ancient forests and pristine rivers, surrounded by spectacular coastline. Its animal inhabitants are every bit as extraordinary as they are bizarre: a cast of black devils, white wallabies, miniature penguins and giant trees. With Antarctica the next landfall south, their lives are governed by the cool climate and strong seasonal calendar. Tasmania may be part of Australia, but life here is very different indeed.
