A desperate group of refugees attempts to recolonize Earth 20,000 years after Godzilla took over, but one young man wants revenge above all else.
Years into the future and the human race has been defeated several times by the new ruling force of the planet: "kaijus". And the ruler of that force is Godzilla, The King of the Monsters. Humanity is in such defeat, plans to leave the planet have been made, and several people have been chosen to look at a new planet to see if it is inhabitable. Realizing it's not, though, the human race resorts to plan B: to defeat Godzilla and take back their planet.
After half-century of the war against gigantic monsters, the human race, deciding to escape the planet Earth for safety, creates a small group to go on a exhibition mission back to the planet. Only to return to a ecosystem topped and dominated by Godzilla.
After being driven from their home planet by Godzilla, a desperate team of refugees returns to Earth to take back humanity's home, led by the vengeful young Haruo Sakaki. However, they find that 20,000 years have passed in their absence, and that the Earth is now a bizarre alien ecosystem ruled by Godzilla.
