A crooked lawyer persuades his brother-in-law to feign a serious injury.
A cameraman is knocked over during a football game. His brother in law as the king of the ambulance chasing lawyers starts a suit while he's still knocked out. The cameraman is against it until he hears that his ex-wife will be coming to see him. He pretends to be injured to get her back, but also sees what the strain is doing to the football player who injured him.
A cameraman gets injured by a football player during a game and goes to the hospital. There, his cunning brother-in-law (who happens to be a lawyer) convinces him to pretend that his legs have been paralyzed. This way, they can receive a huge indemnity from the insurance company. Of course, the insurance company's men suspect that the paralysis is a fake one, and so a big "game" begins. The first collaboration of the successful team of Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon.
