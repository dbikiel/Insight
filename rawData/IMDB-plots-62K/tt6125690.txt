Toma and Ana meet as students in the literature faculty and quickly fall in love.
Toma meets Ana while they are both literature students at university, and they fall in love. Ana suffers from panic attacks and Toma follows her to every dark corner she ends up in. He fights his parents when they reject her, accepts being a father and marries her and eventually becomes her babysitter, her driver, her everything. While he appears to be in control of their relationship, in fact Toma just revolves around a woman he cannot understand, pushing himself to the limit as he tries to save her. Ana slowly overcomes her ailments and they become pregnant, but as she gains a career and personal independence, Toma's world begins shuttering as his insecurities fester under the light of Ana's success. Neither can seem to live without the other, even if they may lead each other to ruin.
Since they met in the college's faculty of literature, Ana and Toma have loved and perfectly complemented each other. Ana, with a traumatic family past, suffers from anxiety attacks, while Toma does not separate from her; both are insulated more and more in their relationship. Through a series of jumps to the past and the future that reconstruct their history together, the latest feature film by the Romanian director Calin Peter Netzer takes place during a session of psychoanalysis that gives the plot vagueness of interpretation. The story examines the love bond of the protagonists, defining it as a game of dependence and fragility.
