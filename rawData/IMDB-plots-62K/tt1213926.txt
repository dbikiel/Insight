The true story of 17-year-old Sicilian Rita Atria (Veronica D'Agostino) -- who broke the Sicilian Mafia's code of silence and testified against the "family business" after both her father and then her brother are both murdered -- is brought to vivid life in Marco Amenta's hard-hitting and wonderfully acted drama.
