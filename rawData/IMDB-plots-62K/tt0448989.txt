If you thought your family was nuts, wait until you meet this Chinese-American clan! Traditional Grandma tries to rule the roost, but her children and grandchildren have ideas of their own.
Yvonne is a divorced middle-aged Chinese immigrant who thinks her life is over, and she is doomed to spend the rest of her days as a slave to her large and eccentric family. Suddenly, romance enters her life and Yvonne gets a long deferred chance for true love. However, she falls for the last person a Chinese family would ever accept, Jose, a Mexican-American dentist. It doesnt matter what race or culture youre from, deep down inside we are the same. And from this lesson Yvonne and her family begin to love each other for who they are and to accept Jose into the family.
