Bob Morgan returns home but alienates his father by not staying at his ranch. Instead he becomes the head of the new Arizona Rangers. Matters get worse between father and son when when his father catches a man he believes to be a murderer and Bob breaks up his lynching party. When the outlaw is broken out of jail by his gang, Bob is relieved of his position. Not giving up, he now heads out alone to face the gang.
