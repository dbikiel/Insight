Money is a running theme in Gary Gulman's comedy special, In This Economy?, where he shares some of his money-saving tips, like staying in a relationship and buying a water filter. He talks about his obsession with Bill Gates, who is worth $59 billion, and launches into an imaginary dialogue between Bill Gates and Donald Trump. His stories about the financial triumph of a parking ticket turning out to be a coupon for Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and finding a $20 bill in his coat pocket and thus being able to afford the $2 guacamole at Chipotle are laughably relatable.
