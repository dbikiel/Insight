But then he befriends the violent Jean-Roger, who's from a severely disturbed family, where nobody cares what he's doing. In school Jean-Roger drives their teacher into despair just for fun. To separate the two boys, she starts to stimulate Bruno's interests by giving him extra lessons. When Jean-Roger fears loosing his one and only friend, he becomes even more aggressive.
In a high density development in the suburbs of Paris, two boys ar left to themselves. The violence of these outskirts is too much. One of them began to see a white visional woman who invites him to the 'freedom' of after life. But his writing talent and is loneliness attract the frienship of his teacher.
