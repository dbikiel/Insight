With her mother away for the weekend, a brash and precocious ten-year-old country-girl sets out to explore Paris during a Métro strike, under her uncle's not-so-watchful eye. Can a little girl cause so much chaos in the heart of the city?
This merry farce depicts a satirical view of the French society: Ten-year-old Zazie has to stay two days with her relatives in Paris, so that her mother can spend some time with her lover. However Zazie escapes her uncle's custody and sets out to explore Paris on her own.
With her mother away for the weekend, the opinionated, brash, and precocious ten-year-old country-girl, Zazie, is entrusted to her artistic Parisian uncle, Gabriel. More than anything in the world, Zazie wants to ride the busy Métro; however, today--of all days--the subway is shut down by a strike. Now--as Gabriel struggles to give Zazie a guided tour--the fearless child sets out to explore this picturesque and bustling metropolis, striking up an acquaintance with many interesting characters, and in the process, cause chaos in the heart of the city. Do we all have equal rights to liberty and anarchy?
When the mother of Zazie comes to Paris to meet her lover, she leaves her daughter with her uncle Gabriel. However the reckless and uncontrollable niece leaves Gabriel's apartment and decides to visit Paris by subway. However the employees are on strike and the runaway girl gets Gabriel into trouble in a chaotic Paris.
