Thirty years on from Vietnam, a government official is trying to track down soldiers who went missing in action, in the hope that it may lead her to her father. Meanwhile, a war veteran is forced to relive painful memories of how he was left for dead by his own platoon, and the heinous crimes he once committed while in the line of duty. Gritty and unflinching, THE VETERAN contains some breathtaking action sequences that vividly depict the horrors of war. Director Sidney J Furie (THE IPCRESS FILE, SUPERMAN IV) elicits strong performances from a cast that includes Michael Ironside, Ally Sheedy, and Bobby Hosea.
