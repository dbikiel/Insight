This twisted sequel to the Oscar-nominated film "Guard Dog" details the continuing adventures of an eager canine. This time he takes a job helping the blind, but still leaves a path of destruction in his wake.
An exuberant dog sees a "guide dog wanted" poster in a store front, and he applies. He shows off his muscles, he pantomimes his skills, he gets the job. He loves the work, but when things go awry, how many chances will he get? And can he learn from his mistakes? Is enthusiasm enough in the world of work?
