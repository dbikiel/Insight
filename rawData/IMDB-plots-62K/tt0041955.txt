Love among the Forsytes is strange, full of tradition, melancholy and gold digging in this film treatise on Victorian-age rigidity and vestiges of a flawed society.
Soames and Irene Forsyte have a marriage of convenience. Young Jolyon Forsyte is a black sheep who ran away with the maid after his wife's death. Teenager June Forsyte has found love with an artist, Phillip Bosinny. The interactions between the Forsytes and the people and society around them is the truss for this love story set in the rigid and strict times of the Victorian age.
The upright and proper solicitor Soames Forsyte is in love with the beautiful Irene but while she likes him him a good deal, she turns down his repeated proposals of marriage. He finally gets her to agree and for the first several years the vain Soames showed her off to London society and all seemed well. Meanwhile, Soames' artist cousin, known as Young Jolyon Forsyte (his father is Old Jolyon) also has taken a liking to Irene. He is the black sheep of the family however having married his daughter June's nanny less than a year after the death of his wife. June, who has lived with her grandfather since age 4, introduces Irene to her new beau architect Philip Bosinney. Soon it's Irene and Philip who fall madly in love. It ultimately leads to tragedy for some and happiness for others.
Irene, a beautiful, desirable but poor woman marries into the wealthy Forsyte family. She is honest with her husband, Soames Forsyte, telling him before marriage that she is not in love with him. He feels that Irene will love him in time. Instead, Irene falls in love with an architect who is engaged to June, Soames' niece, a young woman whose father, Jolyon, is the family outcast. Even as Irene works to reunite Jolyon with the family and with June, she is falling more deeply in love with the man June intends to marry, which causes disruption and tragedy.
