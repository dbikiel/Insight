A young musician seeks to hold a festival to liberate the oppressed people of Guava Island, even if only for a day.
Small time musician Deni Maroon and his loving girlfriend, Kofi Novia, live on a beautiful but impoverished small tropical island called Guava Island that's controlled by a brutal paramilitary group, Red Cargo. The island's main resource is a beautiful, expensive, blue silk produced by a silkworm unique to the island, but the island's textile industry and export is controlled by the paramilitary group and the islanders are forced to work for them every day of the week - the women at the textile factory, and the men at the shipping docks. One day, Deni, who works part time at the docks and part time as the local radio station's house musician whose passionate music is extremely popular among the islanders, decides to hold a secret concert in the evening to make everyone happy, if only for a day. However, the leader of Red Cargo, who also controls the textile industry and export, warns Deni not to do it or the islanders will be too tired to come to work the day after the concert and he can not allow for the textile industry and shipping to stop, even for a single day. Deni decides not to talk about this with Kofi, who becomes worried that something is wrong. She also learns some wonderful news but decides not to share them with Deni until after the concert. As the evening approaches, Deni is forced to make a fateful decision and either betray who he is and what he believes in or stick to his principles no matter the cost.
