After four years working on Richard Thomas' Jerry Springer - The Opera, Stewart Lee returns to stand-up in search of clarity, self-respect and immediate sensual and intellectual gratification. Captured here for Stewart's first ever live DVD release, Stand Up Comedian documents the strongest set of his career, culminating in a sell-out Spring 2005 tour.
