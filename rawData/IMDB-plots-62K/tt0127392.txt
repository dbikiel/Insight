Doctors at an ultramodern hospital in Denmark become convinced, by way of weird, inexplicable happenings, that the place is haunted.
The Kingdom is the most technologically advanced hospital in Denmark, a gleaming bastion of medical science. A rash of uncanny occurrences, however, begins to weaken the staff's faith in science--a phantom ambulance pulls in every night, but disappears; voices echo in the elevator shaft; and a pregnant doctor's fetus seems to be developing much faster than is natural. At the goading of a spiritualist patient, some employees work to let supernatural forces rest.
It starts with the birth of "Little Brother", the son of diabolical murderer Aage Kroeger and the nurse Judith. Doctor Helmer is back from Haiti with some poison and is set to turn Krogshoej into a zombie. Mrs. Drusse gets hit by the phantom taxi. The two dishwashers feel that the forces of Evil are about to wreak havoc on the hospital.
