"The Pink Floyd and Syd Barrett Story" (video release title) tells the full bizarre, tragic, but also celebratory story of Syd Barrett, the co-founder of Pink Floyd. With contributions from friends, managers, lovers and of course the members of Pink Floyd themselves. The film includes rare early television appearances of Pink Floyd and home movies too.
A maverick artist and true individual, Syd Barrett helped forge the British psychedelic scene when he formed Pink Floyd with Roger Waters, Rick Wright and Nick Mason in 1995. The Pink Floyd &amp; Syd Barrett Story is a documentary which examines Pink Floyd's first flash of fame, Barrett's rise and tragic fall, and how the group moved on without him while acknowledging his influence on the album Wish You Were Here. The documentary features rare performance footage, interviews with David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Roger Waters, and memories from a handful of friends and associates of the band.
