A drunken homeowner has a difficult time getting about in his home after arriving home late at night.
Drunk as a skunk, Charlie arrives home by taxi after a wild night out, only to realise that he has lost his key. Now, as an open window becomes the entrance, practically every single item or piece of furniture--including a possessed Murphy bed--becomes a formidable and insurmountable obstacle standing in his way, and working against him. Can't a man find peace at 1 o'clock in the morning?
After a night on the town, Charlie comes home to the house where he is staying, drunk and unable to find his key. For the next twenty minutes he staggers into, out of, and through the house in an inebriated confrontation with the house itself.
A one-man mime show. Charlie comes home drunk. Forgetting his key, he climbs in through the window, climbs back out with the key, and goes through the door. The rest are equilibrium gags, the central one being with his collapsible wall-bed.
