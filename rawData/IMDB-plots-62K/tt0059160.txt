A raw Welsh novelist in Venice is humiliated by a money-loving Frenchwoman who erotically ensnares him.
From back-breaking labour in the coal mines, Tyvian Jones, a masculine and crude man from Wales, finds himself among the artistic and glamorous people at the Venice Film Festival, cashing out his very first novel's big success, "L'Ã‰tranger en Enter". Tyvian is also engaged to the charming and frail Francesca; however, when she has to fly to Rome, he will return to his cottage in Torcello, only to find there the blonde and seductively mysterious Eva occupying his place. Until now, no woman had such an effect on Tyvian, as Eva's dangerously feminine physique soaked from the night's heavy downpour, will instantly taunt, tempt, and seduce his arrogant ego beyond reason. Sooner or later, Tyvian will accept the fact that he stands powerless before this heartless modern Circe, but in the meantime, what will become of innocent Francesca who is now trapped in the middle?
