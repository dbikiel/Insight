Jealous witch Erica uses her powers to influence her unwitting husband Larry and his colleagues, who all work for a big law firm.
Two friends, who both work for the same high-priced, high-powered law firm, are both married to modern day witches. Erica, the wife of Larry, believes that he is being led astray by Carol, an old flame, who also works for the same law firm. Erica decides to act and one night after a torrid sex session Larry drifts off to sleep and begins to dream. Soon the dream turns into a nightmare of sex, violence, murder and death involving himself, his friends and colleagues from the law firm which appears to be frighteningly realistic...
Hell-bent on helping her young lawyer husband, Larry, to climb the corporate ladder, the powerful enchantress, Erica Barnes, casts an irreversible black-magic spell to weed out the competition. However, a disastrous mistake will pave the way for retribution, demonic possession, and death, as Amelia--the target's equally dangerous witch wife--will stop at nothing to destroy everyone who stands in her way. Now, a magical artefact imbued with the dark force of Hell is Amelia's effective means of manipulation. Will she take her revenge? Will Larry ever be free from the suffocating stranglehold of the sorceress?
