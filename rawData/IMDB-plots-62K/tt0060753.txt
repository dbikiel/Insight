Escaped convict Griffin and his friends ran all the way to Hell...with a penny, and a broken cigarette.
A trio of convicts joins up for an assault on a Cuban stronghold. After they are captured, they plan to escape before they face the firing squad. They eventually make it back to the American Southwest, where they go from town to town, robbing and killing.
Griffin escapes from jail and teams up with two local thugs to invade Cuba. However they are soon captured by a Castro look-alike and put in a cell, where the prisoners are giving a sub-human treatment. But Griffin hatches a plan. Is it enough to save the day for the friends, and bring peace to Cuba?
Follow the story of some random guys doing a bunch of pointless things in a movie that has the plot-line as coherent and understandable as George W. Bush trying to give a speech with a bowling ball in his mouth.
