"Train is first seen rounding a curve nearly a mile away. Approaches at the rate of 70 miles an hour, blowing a warning whistle to a gang of track repairers."
The Black Diamond Express, the fastest train of the Lehigh Valley Railroad, speeds along the track, moving directly towards the camera. As it approaches, a group of workers along the tracks pull back from the rails. Some of them begin to wave at the train as it comes nearer.
