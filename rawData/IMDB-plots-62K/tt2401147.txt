A seductive teen becomes vindictive when her boyfriend tries to end the relationship.
Vanessa moves fast to claim Chris for her own, taking his time away and distancing him from his family and friends. His mom, Maddie, is disturbed by their sudden relationship and when she discovers a secret of Vanessa's and she uses all her resources to convince Chris to end it. Angered and vengeful, Vanessa accuses Chris of a heinous act that turns the school against him and sparks an online attack. When things get violent, Vanessa plans her next move and Maddie must find out Vanessa's game before she loses her son forever.
Sixteen year old high school junior Chris Stewart falls into a depression after his first girlfriend, Cheryl, breaks up with him. That depression is debilitating enough that he is unable to go to school, that absence which his mother, Maddie Stewart, allows. When Chris does resume his school studies, he meets transfer student Vanessa Redlynn, who quickly makes him forget about Cheryl as Vanessa actively pursues him. They quickly become a couple. What Chris is unaware of is that besides being in foster care, everything that she tells him about herself is a lie and is all in her all-consuming manipulation of him and his life. Maddie, who is going through her own break up with Chris' father, allows Chris and Vanessa some leeway at the beginning for Vanessa's seeming protection. But Maddie quickly begins to feel that not all is right with Vanessa mentally. It may be difficult for Maddie to convince Chris of her beliefs in his vulnerable state and as he seems to have become infatuated with her. But as Maddie learns more and more about Vanessa - much of her past sealed in child welfare records - it may be too late for Chris, who may befall the same fate as a few other boys before him.
