Wintertime in Lyon. About a dozen people, men and women, are having a snowball fight in the middle of a tree-lined street. The cyclist coming along the road becomes the target of opportunity. He falls off his bicycle. He's not hurt, but he rides back the way he came, as the fight continues. Uh-oh. He forgot his cap in the snow.
A bunch of adult men and women are having a snowball fight on a street, each against all. Some of the men wear hats, all the women long skirts. A man is coming on a bicycle straight into the crowd. He is hit by several snowballs, loses his balance and falls to the ground with his bicycle. He lands on his back, gets up, struggles to reach his bike, while the fight continues around him. Another man rises the bicycle. The biker turns it around, mounts it, and goes back the same way from which he arrived, forgetting his cap on the ground. The snowball fight continues.
