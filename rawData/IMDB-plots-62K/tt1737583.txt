When a girl falls from her horse, suffering terrible injuries, the neigh sayers feel she will never get back in the saddle.
Successfull Arizona architect Phillip Danville has horses on his estate. After his daughter Jenna incurs possibly incurable spinal injuries during a riding competition, her fianc√© Carson leaves. Phillipp arranges for her to be admitted to a specialized institute, where physiotherapist Eugene Gibbs does the best possible experimental rehab combination job, and competitive fellow patient Annie contributes motivation. Home at the ranch, equally hunky neighbor Will Dutton, a veterinarian whose rodeo career ended in a multiple leg fracture, cures the Danville's star horse and becomes Jenna's new boyfriend.
