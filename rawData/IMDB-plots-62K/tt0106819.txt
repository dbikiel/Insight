While on a mission to stop a drug operation, three Federal agents accidentally discover gold from the Civil War. With the aid of a corrupt agent, a ruthless criminal kingpin will hunt them down, one by one.
In a suicide mission during the American Civil War, two soldiers discover gold which will bury on the root of a big tree, somewhere deep in the woods. More than a century later, three Federal agents in the same forests are on a mission to bust a drug-manufacturing operation run by the ruthless criminal kingpin, Santiago, and his men; however, an unexpected complication will lead to their suspension. Out of sheer luck, the operatives unearth the hidden treasure while on vacation--and from that point on--trouble ensues, as Santiago along with a duplicitous corrupt agent and his deadly personal assassin, Jewel Panther, will hunt them down, one by one. But, can brute force alone stop the expert and lethal agents?
Three Federal agents go in search of gold supposedly hidden by Quantrell during the Civil War after they are suspended by a corrupt official for excessive force during a drug raid. Meanwhile a drug lord (Obregon) hires a hit woman (Strain) to kill the three for interfering with his operations.
