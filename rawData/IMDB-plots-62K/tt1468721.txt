Ellen (Jeanne Balibar) is a flight attendant edging into middle age who is growing disenchanted with her job and gets a wake-up call about her love life when her boyfriend Florian (Georg Friedrich) informs her he's been sleeping with another woman -- who is soon to make him a father. Florian proposes that he, Ellen and the other woman could all live together, which Ellen doesn't agree with. Ellen walks away from her job. With no idea of what she wants to do with herself, Ellen almost randomly falls in with a radical animal rights group and embraces a new life of political action, drugs and free love. Has Ellen truly embraced a new life, or is she simply reacting to her anger over what happened to the old one?
