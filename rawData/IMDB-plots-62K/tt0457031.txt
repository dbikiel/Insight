A cartoon version of the Greek myth of Labyrinth.
Theseus, the son of the Athenian king Egeya, was raised by a centaur. Now it's time to return to his father in Athens. On the way, he liberates the neighborhood from the fierce boar and insidious robber Procrustes. Upon reaching Athens, Theseus learns that a ship has arrived from the island of Crete, which comes every nine years to collect seven girls and seven young men as a tribute to the Minotaur. Theseus goes on this ship to Crete to kill the Minotaur. Killing him, Theseus gets out from the labyrinth in which the Minotaur lived, with the help of the thread of Ariadne, the daughter of Minos, King of Crete. Together with Ariadna Theseus sails home.
