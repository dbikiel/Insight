An emotionally beaten man with his young daughter moves to his ancestral home in Newfoundland to reclaim his life.
An inksetter in New York, Quoyle (Kevin Spacey) returns to his family's longtime home, a small fishing town in Newfoundland, with his young daughter, Bunny (Alyssa, Kaitlyn, and Lauren Gainer), after a traumatizing experience with her mother, Petal (Cate Blanchett), who sold her to an illegal adoption agency. Though Quoyle has had little success thus far in life, his shipping news column in the newspaper "The Gammy Bird" finds an audience, and his experiences in the town change his life. Then he meets the widow Wavey Prowse (Julianne Moore).
This is a movie about an insecure man who starts a life only to see it fall apart in front of him. As he attempts to rebuild his life, he meets some interesting people and learns things about his past and his family's past that he would not have been able to even imagine if nobody had told him.
