A saintly woman, Clara, guides three recent acquaintances in a journey of self-discovery with the help of Tonton, an elder man who has reached an enhanced state of connection with the universe.
Camille, a beautiful woman in her forties, picks up the cell phone that Suzy lost in a station. When Suzy calls her own number, they agree to a meeting at Camille's so that she can recover her property. During this meeting, Suzy also meets Clara, Camille's partner. But they are interrupted by Fabrice, Suzy's drunk lover, who tries to bring her back to him. While Clara takes Suzy to hide in an apartment above their own, where already the strange "Tonton", an old sage, yoga lover, Camille tries to calm Fabrice and little by little, the console. It is from then on a strange crossover that begins: Camille knots a passionate story with Fabrice, while Tonton initiates Suzy to meditation and levitation. Little by little, everyone finds their own way to happiness, their own place in the game of feelings.
