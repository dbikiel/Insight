Laura and her son Henry are forced to drive her estranged, pot-dealing, carefree father Jack cross country after being kicked out of a nursing home.
Single mom Laura (Farmiga), along with her awkward 14 year-old son Henry (MacDougall) is forced to drive Jack (Plummer), her estranged, care-free pot dealing father across country after he's kicked out of yet another nursing home. The road trip veers off course when Jack decides to make a couple 'stops' and Henry asks to see his ne'er-do-well dad Leonard (Cannavale), completely upending Laura's attempt to hold her family together and ultimately forcing her to finally see her father for the man he really is.
