A comedy of errors with identical quadruplets, separated at birth, coming together as adults.
Quadruplets of a rich family are separated at birth by a jealous uncle. One of them ends up with the real father, and grows up to be a suave millionaire. The other three end up in various places: one becomes a fireman, another a wedding cook, and the last a thug. The thug is coincidentally hired to bump off the millionaire, who in the meantime switches places with the fireman.
