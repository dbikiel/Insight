Georgette lives alone, works as a long-haul aircraft cleaner and has never won anything significant but her big break comes when she wins a luxury stay on the Reunion Island. She chooses to go with her friend Lydie, a native of the island.
Georgette works as an airplane cleaner and has two passions in life: opera and TV quiz shows that promise you the world - On her fortieth birthday, bingo. Having never left an airport tarmac, she wins a trip to Reunion Island in the heart of the Indian Ocean. At the check-in, she meets for the first time the famous pianist Tancrède Ferté Laroche, who, rumor has it, is fast going downhill. As luck would have it, their seats are side by side, for when it comes to music, Georgette's a huge fan. But she isn't so happy to discover that they're also staying at the same hotel. It's as though fate were desperately trying to bring together two people who were never destined to meet - And everything stands in their way: she's as poor as he is rich; he's as miserly as she is generous.
