A young woman's murder causes the subjects of a century-long mission to populate a new world to question the true nature of the project as they approach the point of no return.
Ascension is an ambitious original drama following a covert U.S. space mission launched in the 1960's that sent hundreds of men, women and children on a century-long voyage aboard the starship Ascension to populate a new world. Half way into their journey, as they approach the point of no return, the mysterious murder of a young woman causes the ship's population to question the true nature of their mission. The series features the confident and capable First Officer Aaron Gault, the eponymous ship's Captain William Denninger, and Viondra Denninger, the captain's beautiful, manipulative and dangerous wife (who also serves as the ship's Chief Steward). Also included are Chief Astronomer Emily Vanderhaus, the ship's head doctor Juliet Bryce, the doctor's daughter, Nora Bryce, and Nora's love interest, James Toback.
