After 6 years in the cavalry, Chad Santee plans to raise cattle with his brother Jubal but Jubal is involved in a different line of work.
Chad Santee heads west to join his brother, Jubal, who supposedly has a large cattle ranch. On the way he meets Rose Fargo and rescues her from the unwanted advances of a gambler, "Blackjack". When Chad and Rose arrive they find that Jubal and his partner, Shawnee, are really rustlers and outlaws. Jubal tries to get Chad to join them but he refuses, and leaves to set up his own homestead with Rose at his side. Later, the repentant Jubal comes to join him. Shawnee, angry at what he considers a double-cross, attacks the brothers with his gang.
