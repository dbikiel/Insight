During the Mexican Revolution, a macho rebel general falls in love with the independent-minded daughter of an aristocrat in the town he is occupying.
In Mexican Revolution times, a guerrilla general (Armendáriz) and his troops take the conservative town of Cholula, near by Mexico City. As the revolutionaries mistreat the town's riches, Armendáriz falls for beautiful and wild Beatriz Peñafiel (María Félix), the daughter of one of the town's richest men.
The story takes place during the Mexican Revolution. The troops of General Jose Juan Reyes (Almendariz) take from the rich to support the army. While the general is in town confiscating land from the rich, he meets Beatriz (Felix) who stirs in him a yearning that he had never before felt in his life.
