It's one of the "Bruceploitation" films that were made to cash in on Bruce Lee after his death. The story follows Bruce Lee after he dies and ends up in Hell. Once there, he does the logical thing and opens a gym. After fending off the advances of the King Of Hell's naked wives, he discovers that the most evil people in Hell are attempting a takeover, so Bruce sets out to stop it. As if it wasn't weird enough, the evil people are: Zatoichi (the blind swordsman hero of Japanese film), James Bond, The Godfather, The Exorcist, Emmanuelle (the "heroine" of many European softcore porn films), Dracula, and, of course, Clint Eastwood (played by a Chinese guy). Aiding Bruce is The One-Armed Swordsman (hero of kung-fu films), Kain from the U.S. tv series, Kung-Fu (actually played by a Chinese guy this time), and Popeye the Sailor Man! Yes, Popeye the Sailor Man. He eats spinach and helps Bruce fight some mummies.
Following his untimely death, Bruce Lee (Bruce Leung Siu-lung) wakes up to find himself in the "Underworld." He meets the King of the Underworld and questions his power. The King demonstrates his displeasure by shaking a pole that can cause an earthquake through the Underworld. Bruce quickly ditches his cocky attitude and later becomes a bodyguard for the King.Bruce then goes to a restaurant, where he meets Caine from the TV show Kung Fu and famous sailor-man Popeye. He also runs into James Bond, Dracula, Zatoichi, and Clint Eastwood, who do not appreciate Bruce's presence in the Underworld. Those characters, along with The Godfather, The Exorcist, and Emmanuelle are planning a coup to take over the Underworld. Among their schemes, the characters send Emmanuelle to have energetic sex with the King in the hopes that he will have a heart attack and die.Bruce defeats his enemies, but is angered by the King's repeated use of his dangerous earthquake-inducing pole. Bruce threatens to kill the King unless the King lets him go back to Earth, which the King does.
