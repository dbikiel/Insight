A little love drama between Julián, an honest typesetter, and 'chulapa' Susana, adapted from a famous Spanish 'zarzuela'.
Susana and her sister Casta, who live with aunt Antonia, an old little matchmaker, flirt with the apothecary Don Hilarión, a dirty old man who gets his hopes up, not realizing that the two girls just want to have fun playing with him. This game causes Julián's jealousy, always staffed by maternal and advisor "Señá" Rita. After some adventures in the festival, the old man is mocked and love triumphs between Julián and Susana.
