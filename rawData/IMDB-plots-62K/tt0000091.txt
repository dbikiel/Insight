With the help of a magic cauldron, Mephistopheles conjures up a variety of supernatural characters.
A bat flies into an ancient castle and transforms itself into Mephistopheles himself. Producing a cauldron, Mephistopheles conjures up a young girl and various supernatural creatures, one of which brandishes a crucifix in an effort to force the devil-vampire to vanish.
As a ferocious large bat enters a daunting medieval manor, the prince of darkness assumes his true form, and without delay, he produces a black ritual cauldron. Before long, two weary cavaliers who will inadvertently take part in the dark ceremony will witness firsthand the otherworldly horrors spawned on earth. Who has the heart to oppose the archfiend's evil trickery?
