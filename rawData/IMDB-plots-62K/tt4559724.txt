Doctor Karl Stahlbaum's kids Franz and Marie receive a special, mechanically driven musical cabinet from inventor uncle Anselmus Drosselmeier as novelty Christmas present. While Fritz soon turns to his tin soldiers gift from their parents, Marie dreams about the fairy tale characters from the tales Anselmus chose them from, which start coming alive in her dreams, especially as she falls ill. Sugar fairy is defended by a brave Nutcracker-soldier, who lost an arm when Fritz tried cracking a canon ball, against the mean, ambitious mouse king. When she recovers, a charming visitor fits her dreams.
