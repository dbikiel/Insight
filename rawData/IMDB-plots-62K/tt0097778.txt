Mollie is a single mum who's on the lookout for a reliable and normal boyfriend. Her son Mikey, (unbeknownst to her) seems to have a better idea of which of the men she dates would make a good father figure! If only she could understand him...
Double-crossed, the lovelorn and very pregnant New York City accountant, Mollie, gets into James' cab and rushes to the hospital to give birth, after a failed attempt at love with a sleazy and self-centred businessman. Suddenly, Mollie is a single working mum--and what is even more disheartening--she has to embark on the nearly impossible quest to unearth the ideal father for her outspoken boy, Mikey. Could the perfect father be James, Mikey's favourite babysitter?
Mollie is an accountant who has been having an affair with one of her clients, Albert, who happens to be married. When she becomes pregnant by him, she feels that he will be there always for her and the new baby. But when she gives birth, he breaks it off and Mollie is left to raise a new baby all by herself. She also is searching for the perfect father for her new son, Mikey. She meets James, a swift cab driver, who seems to be a perfect match with her and Mikey. But when Albert comes to her, who will Mollie choose?
