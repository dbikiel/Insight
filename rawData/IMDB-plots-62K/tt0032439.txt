Elmer takes up wildlife photography, but finds his subject, a rabbit similar to the later Bugs Bunny character, much too wild.
Elmer Fudd, in suit, ascot, and bowler, reads "How to Photograph Wild Life," gets his camera kit - with tripod and flash, and heads into the countryside. He happens on tracks and soon comes upon a sleeping rabbit. He sets up his camera and that's when his troubles begin. The rabbit wakes up before Elmer can snap the picture, and while the rabbit is seemingly helpful, his various antics drive Elmer mad. Will there be a photo before the finish?
In his first big screen appearance, Elmer Fudd has decided to take up photography, specifically nature photography. He follows rabbit tracks to find a sleeping Bugs Bunny who proves to be a somewhat difficult subject to capture on film. His attempts to photograph other wildlife - a squirrel, a bird - are no more successful thanks to that pesky rabbit.
