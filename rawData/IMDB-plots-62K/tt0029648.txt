Seven maps, when found and put together, reveal the location of the treasures of Genghis Khan.
Mr Moto competes with a gang of ruthless treasure-hunters for possession of seven scrolls which, when brought together, form a map which reveals the location of the tomb of Genghis Khan, reputed to contain fabulous treasure. Moto already has one scroll, but the rest are owned by Prince Chung and his mother, who consider it a sacred duty to their ancestors to protect the scrolls and the secret of the Khan's tomb.
Mr. Moto finds himself in Peiping seeking ancient scrolls that, placed together, will form a map to the location of Genghis Khan's long-hidden treasure. There are a total of seven scrolls and Moto himself has recently acquired one of these during a foray into Mongolia. The remaining six scrolls are in the possession of Madame Chung and her son, Prince Chung. They very much want to protect the dignity and honor of their ancestors and with Moto's help, try to keep thieves, led by Colonel Tchernov, from getting their hands on the map.
