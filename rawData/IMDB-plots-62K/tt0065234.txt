In a northern Greek city in the 1960's, a leading opposition politician is attacked while his party is holding a rally. The dead man's party was against foreign intervention in national affairs and was seen as a threat to national security. The cover-up begins almost immediately with the police claiming the dead man was struck by a drunk driver. A prosecutor assigned to the case and he interviews everyone involved, gathering evidence which shows the assassination was potted by senior policemen and right-wing extremists. Getting appropriate actions proves to be something else entirely.
Repression is the rule of the day in this film that skewers Greek governance of the 1960s. Z, a leftist rabble rouser, is killed in what appears to be a traffic accident. But given the political climate, the death of such a prominent activist raises troubling questions. Though it's too late to save Z's life, a postmortem examination suggests that the ruling party was behind his death. As the facts leak out, those who tell the truth pay the price for their honesty.
Costa-Gavras chronicles the overthrow of the democratic government in Greece. When a liberal politician is murdered in an attack during a peace demonstration, the right wing figures in the military and the police try to hide not only their parts in it, but also to cover up the murder as well. The magistrate acts as an investigator in order to reveal the cover up. Historically accurate, it is told as a combination murder mystery and thriller.
