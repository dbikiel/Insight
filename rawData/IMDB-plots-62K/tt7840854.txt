Eight years after a cataclysm and disease ravaged the human race - leaving just one in every ten surviving -, all social structures have crumbled like sand castles. Too few still live for anything to have been reconstructed. All remaining animals have been consumed and no sowing has yet been possible. It is Man at his most basic, destitute level.

It is a war only the most desperate of the two will win.
