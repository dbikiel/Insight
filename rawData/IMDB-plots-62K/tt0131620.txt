A disgraced reporter investigates an abandoned luxury hotel where five people mysteriously disappeared sixty years earlier.
The film starts out when 5 people walk into an elevator, but something goes very wrong. The elevator collapses 11 floors and the five people roam around the hotel as ghosts. 60 years later, reporter Buzzy (Steve Guttenberg) and his niece Anna (Kirsten Dunst) are trying to find out the mystery of the hotel. An old lady named Abigail tells them that if they find a belonging of each person on the elevator they will be free from the hotel.
This Disney made-for-TV film has Steve Guttenberg as a tabloid reporter who wants to write legitimately again. He investigates an old woman's story behind the famous disappearance of five including a beloved child actress that occurred at the Hollywood Hotel in the 1930s. Everyone says the Hollywood Hotel is haunted now, and when Guttenberg explores it, he finds out why.
