A young woman arrives at the home of her socialite cousin, and soon finds herself sucked into the woman's complex web of deceit.
Eva Phillips is a Southern socialite whose manipulation and ruthlessness ruins the lives of everyone around her. The question is, will anyone be able to stop her?
The first trip that young Chicagoan Jennifer Stewart ever makes to the south is to Phillips House, the home of her middle-aged cousin Eva Phillips, who has acted as her benefactress for most of her life, who invited her, and with who this visit will be her first meeting. Phillips House has long been the home for the Phillips family: Avery 'Beauty' Phillips, Eva's husband so nicknamed because of the scar across his face sustained long ago in a car accident, and Beauty's sister Carol Lee Phillips, who still lives at the house. Jennifer is quickly introduced to many of the Phillips' friends and associates, most who are cordial toward Jennifer. Ty McKinnon in particular is attracted to Jennifer, a courtship with who Eva ultimately fosters. The one person who isn't friendly toward Jennifer is alcoholic Beauty, who seems to resent her visit. However, when Jennifer first meets Eva, she notices that Eva places a pall over the room. Even Beauty seems to despise her. Despite these feelings by the others, Jennifer is enamored on first sight with her cousin. Jennifer quickly learns of the figuratively incestuous relationship they all have with each other. But based on warnings from Carol, Jennifer soon sees what the others do: that Eva is much like a queen bee, she who must take control for her own benefit, and who will destroy anyone in her way. Jennifer eventually gets caught up in the goings-on at Phillips House, she who may be destroyed in the process if the queen bee has her way, especially because of what Jennifer wants more than anything at Phillips House: Beauty.
