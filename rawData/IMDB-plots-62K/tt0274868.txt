Twenty-something Samantha searches for excitement and an elusive happiness, but finds sex and dissatisfaction instead.
Samantha is a schoolteacher lost in the netherworld of her late 20's - no longer young but not yet middle aged. She leaves her long-time boyfriend, who she's been living with in a "brother and sister" relationship for quite some time. Wanting change and searching for an elusive happiness, Samantha strikes out on her own. But she quickly finds the regeneration she seeks can be far from romantic. From the classrooms filled with smiling children, to the crowded bars of Los Angeles, Samantha goes looking for life; its fun, its love, its passion, and its meaning. This is a film about what she found.
