A poker-playing restaurateur and former traveling salesman befriends a group of refugees newly arrived to Finland.
Khaled, syrian refugee stows away on a freighter to Helsinki. Meanwhile, Wikström is a traveling salesman who wins big at a poker table and buys himself a restaurant with the proceeds. When the authorities turn down his application for asylum, Khaled is forced underground and Wikström finds him sleeping in the yard behind his restaurant. He offers him a job and a roof over his head and, for a while, they form a Utopian union with the restaurant's waitress, the chef and his dog.
As Khaled, a young Syrian mechanic who has escaped Aleppo's living nightmare finds his way into Helsinki by accidentally stowing himself away on a coal freighter, on the other side of the town, Wikström, a joyless travelling salesman, experiences a profound mid-life crisis. Under those circumstances, Khaled and Wikström who are desperately looking for a fresh start will eventually cross paths, when the latter after an endless night of high-stakes poker buys himself a decrepit restaurant and offers Khaled not only shelter but also work. In the end, no one can say whether the Syrian refugee has a future in the Finnish capital, what is undisputed though, is that he will find an eccentric but affectionate new family.
