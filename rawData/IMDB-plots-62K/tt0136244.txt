Hideous Kinky is the story of two sisters (seven and five years old) traveling with their hippie mother from London to Morocco. They encounter many adventures, new experiences, and interesting culture as they tag along on their mother's search for freedom and love. It is told through the eyes of the youngest girl, and we learn her observations on life, Mum, and determined sister, Bea.
An Englishwoman travels to Morocco with her two young daughters, where they deal with and adjust to the culture and people of the area. Told from the perspective of the youngest daughter, the story provides insight into the Moroccan atmosphere. Based on a 1992 novel by Esther Freud.
Hideous Kinky is set in a time about 30 years ago when it was not uncommon for young British free-thinkers to cross into the next continent with virtually nothing in their pockets. They left their proper schooling and part-time jobs behind to make their trek into a poor, desert country in Africa in search of themselves and their spirituality. And so this story begins with a young English hippie woman who has brought her two young daughters with her on her journey. Though the book is narrated by the youngest of the two daughters, it is not yet clear that this is so in the screenplay version of Hideous Kinky.
