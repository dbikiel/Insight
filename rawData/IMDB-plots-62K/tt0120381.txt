A brother and sister are plane-wrecked in Canada, where they must rely on the help of a native and his bear.
Two city kids gain a new perspective on life when they're lost in rugged Northwestern Canada in this adventure for the family. Sam (Zachery Ty Bryan) and Bonnie (Kirsten Dunst) are two teenage siblings who don't always get along, a situation made more uncomfortable by their mother's recent remarriage. While Sam and Bonnie are flying home on a small chartered place, their flight crashes in the wilderness of British Columbia. Sam and Bonnie are the only survivors of the wreck and must fend for themselves until they are discovered by Khonanesta (August Schellenberg), a Native North American who lives in the woods with his only companion, a huge Kodiak bear he's named "Grandfather." Khonanesta teaches Sam and Bonnie how to live off the land, and as they learn how to survive in the wild, they become closer, more confident, and better adjusted; they also help Khonanesta foil a group of game poachers who are illegally hunting bear in the wilderness. Bonnie and Sam's mother and stepfather finally find their missing children, but when they do, they mistakenly implicate Khonanesta in the illegal activities of the game poachers.
