A tiny alien lands in the small town of Aurora, Texas in the wild west. He flies around in his spaceship and checks out everything. While the kids are fascinated, their parents are rather sceptic and afraid. Ms. Peabels, teacher and new owner of the local paper, smells a good story, and brings the alien into the headlines. When the Governor hears of the rumors, he sends a Ranger to take action.
