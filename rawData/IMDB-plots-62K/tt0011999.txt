The Pennypackers are a family of social climbers. Their daughter is about to be married solely to get ahead in the world. There is another potential marriage in their household, as their housemaid has been proposed to by many of the other servants. Everything changes when the somewhat off-looking Lucky Luke Larson enters their lives. Making his wealth in oil, he is purportedly the son of the Pennypacker's now deceased former business partner, whose last wish was for his son and their daughter to be wed. The Pennypacker parents are glad to oblige if only for access to his wealth and associated prestige, which leaves their daughter's current fianc√© out in the cold. But Lucky Luke and the housemaid fall in love with each other. Will true love or greed triumph?
A social-climbing, bankrupt couple want to marry their daughter to a rich man; they're delighted when Luke Larson, an oil magnate, pays a call. She doesn't like Luke, but lunches with him, watches him play golf, and plans the wedding. He's more attracted to the family's modest (but spirited) maid, whom the butler likes. A telegram arrives during the wedding saying that Luke has lost his fortune, so dad sends Luke to work in the kitchen, supervised by the butler and a lazy cook. After various mistakes, Luke's fired, so the maid quits in protest. They leave in Luke's car, which the butler and chef have sabotaged. Will Luke and the maid cheat death - and salvage anything else?
