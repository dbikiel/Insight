Inspired by a store display, Donald decides to "hunt" some wildlife with his camera. First, he encounters a too-friendly chipmunk, then a large group of shy animals, then some animals in a dark cave. But his biggest challenge is a woodpecker, who finds a number of ways to torment him, even though Donald does manage to trick him briefly using some toothpaste that pretends to be a worm.
