From a stationary camera, we see the base of the Eiffel Tower, a crowd walking in the foreground during the 1900 Paris Exposition. Behind the tower and to the left is a smokestack pouring out smoke. A man and a woman, each wearing a hat, walk in front of the camera and appear in silhouette. Except for the trail of smoke, the sky is clear.
