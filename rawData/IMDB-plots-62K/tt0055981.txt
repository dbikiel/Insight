Despite his fiancee's reluctance, a young man moves to Sicily for a better job, but soon starts questioning his decision.
In the industrial North, Giovanni is a skilled factory worker offered a promotion if he'll go to Sicily for 18 months to assist in a new department. His impending absence strains his already nearly wordless relationship with Liliana, his fianc√©e. They meet regularly at a dance hall and sometimes go riding on his motorcycle. We watch him arrive in Sicily, walk the town, live in a hotel, find lodgings, work, and participate in local events. It's a solitary, melancholy life. In his mind's eye he thinks about Liliana. He hasn't been entirely faithful. There's pain and detachment in her eyes. Across this distance, can anything bring about a breakthrough? Do they have a future?
Olm's tale is of 2 Milanese young adults living in post WWII Italy. There's not much to do but to hangout at the local dance hall were the men try to get lucky. The beautiful Liliana is shy and pure. Giovanni is pensive and impatient. When Giovanni decides to take a job promotion which requires him to relocate, Liliana is despondent. Giovanni, pragmatic. The deed is done. The new industrial workplace is barren, lonely, and desolate. Through a series of letters the two lovers, especially Giovanni, realize the beauty of their relationship. Remindful of both Fellini and Antonioni, just when we desire a happy ending, the last scene of a tremendous rainstorm casts the likelihood of a fulfillment to their happiness as an unlikely probability.
