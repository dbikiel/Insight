A Christmas obsessed Jewish boy on his way to sunny Florida figures out how to get the Christmas of his dreams by trading airline tickets and places with another boy on his way to snowy Christmastown, WA.
Ira J. Finkelstein is obsessed with Christmas. He's seen every Christmas movie ever made and his dreams are filled with reindeer, sleigh rides and SNOW. The problem? Ira's Jewish - and at 11 years old, Christmas is passing him by. When Ira's hopes for a holiday vacation in Aspen are dashed, he hatches a plan to finally get the Christmas of his dreams. Flying unaccompanied to visit his grandparents in Florida, he swaps tickets with Mikey, another 11-year-old on his way to Christmastown, WA . Ira gets more than he bargained for when he experiences his first "White Christmas".
