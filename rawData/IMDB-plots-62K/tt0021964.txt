Piggy and Fluffy have adventures on a riverboat. And Uncle Tom is chased by skeletons promising to take him to Hallelujah Land.
Three workers on a riverboat sing the title tune, accompanying themselves on a banjo, a jew's harp and bones. Meanwhile, Uncle Tom drives Fluffy the pig on a donkey cart to the dock, where she can board the riverboat. Her beau Piggy is the captain. Piggy's adventures include riding the tail of an alligator, rescuing Fluffy from a moustache-twirling villain and saving Uncle Tom from drowning. Uncle Tom had had his own adventure when he inadvertently wound up in a graveyard. The skeletons had risen from their graves promising to take him to Hallelujah Land.
