A man named Clint enters a solar-powered van called Vandora into a competition called Freakout.
Mark Schneider plays a restless young man who quits his job at his dad's garage because he's "got a chance to do something." Specifically, he's got a chance to drive his van "The Sea Witch"-emblazoned with his CB handle, Morgan The Pirate-to The Invitational Freak-Out, a "van-in" held in Kansas City, where custom van owners gather to smoke weed, screw in the woods, and show off their machines for cash and prizes. Along the way, though, Schneider meets Katie Saylor, a rich runaway who's been detained at a junkyard by "a couple of friendly bikers on their way to a rape." Schneider saves Saylor, but in the process, The Sea Witch gets crushed by a compactor. So Schneider goes to see a friend who's a rebel auto designer, and the friend offers Schneider and Saylor Vandora, a solar-powered van that was rejected by the fat cats at Mid-American Motors.
