"Hutsulka Ksenya" is a musical comedy based on the operetta by Yaroslav Barnych, which is set in Ukraine in 1939. It tells a story of a young Ukrainian-American man Yaro that comes to the Carpathian Mountains, because his father, who was concerned that his son does not know his roots, left him a fortune under the condition that he would marry a true Ukrainian girl. He stays at a local hotel run by a group of strong, fun-loving and educated women. There also lives an eccentric professor, who wants to find a unique butterfly that lays eggs only on lambs' tails. If Yaro does not find a wife within a year of his father's death, the fortune will be passed to his distant relative Mary. Therefore, Mary's mother Helen came to the Carpathians with her daughter and does everything she can to stop Yaro from marrying. In the mountains, Yaro meets a Hutsul girl Ksenya, who seems to embody everything his father told him about Ukrainian women. The two fall in love. Yaro needs to rethink his plan and considers staying. This very year the Soviet occupation of Western Ukraine will take place.
