The story of three teenagers: a beautiful girl, Vanessa, and two boys, Mickael and Clement, one rich, one poor. The story of Mickael - judo fanatic and doomed lover - and his parents, both convinced that the sky will one day come crashing down on their heads, and both more than able to cope when it does. Blackly comic, brutally funny, heartbreaking, truthful. A tragi-comedy. About happiness and hardship, sex, luck and catastrophe.
