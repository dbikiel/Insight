A secret admirer's crush on a high school athlete takes a fatal turn.
The promising high school soccer player Scott is injured on the knee in a game and two years after, he is still trying to heal his knee. The teenager Jules feels unrequited love for him but Scott is concentrated in recovering his physical condition and considers her as a friend. The also teenager Bess that works in the store owned by David with her mature colleague Andie has a crush on Scott. When Scott is stalked by a mysterious person that threatens Jules, he believes that Bess is responsible for the weird situations. Is his assumption correct?
Scott is the ideal thrust on every high school boy: an athletic and promising soccer player, he is popular, charismatic and secretly a sensitive artist. All is well for him until he spurns the advances of his possessive best friend, popular, determined and manipulative Jules, and attracts the attention of the troubled and lonely outcast Bess. Bess has few friends: two colleagues who are secretly afraid of her, and Jeffrey, a mysterious boy who seems to relish in watching her obsessive, dangerous side in action. When Jules claims to have been threatened by a mysterious onlooker, Scott doesn't know who to trust anymore, and he is forced to watch those he loves suffer at the hands of his secret admirer until his own demons get the best of him.
