Elliott Gould and Diane Keaton take out a lease on love with an option to buy in this glossy romantic comedy costarring Paul Sorvino, Victoria Principal and Candy Clark. Unhappily divorced after 10 years of marriage, Les Bingham (Gould) finally convinces his ex-wife Katie (Keaton) to give him another shot. Reluctantly agreeing to a legal arrangement instead of a wedding vow, Les signs a six-month contract, unaware his lawyer (Sorvino) also loves Katie and plans to use the wiles of their sexy neighbor (Principal) to bust up the Binghams for good. Cowritten and directed by Norman Panama (How to Commit Marriage), I Will... I Will... For Now was produced by George Barrie, CEO of Faberg√©. A musician-turned-businessman, Barrie would produce over a dozen films, earning Oscar nominations for "All That Love Went to Waste" (A Touch of Class, 1973) and "Now That We're in Love" (Whiffs, 1975), two songs he wrote with Sammy Cahn.
