Strange things ensue after a young man attempts to take his own life.
Out of work, Buster tries various ways to commit suicide. At last he tries "poison" from a bottle containing booze. The president of a sporting club speaks of the need for a sportsman to promote the club and drunken Buster gets the job for which he must learn fishing, hunting and riding.
Considered lost for more than eighty years, "Hard Luck" portrays a penniless; desolate; famished; and down on his luck, Buster, who is, however, willing to work for food. Dispirited but determined to put an abrupt end to his miserable life, Buster tries various methods of suicide, only to find himself deeper and deeper into a frenzied world of fishing, fox hunting, bold scientific discoveries, and feral armadillos. Can Buster convince the world that he is a man of rare talents--and above all--deep and noble feelings?
