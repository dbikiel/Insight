A young woman who is disowned by her alcoholic father turns to prostitution to support herself; her scheming brother-in-law devises a plan to marry her off and make some money in the process.
Anna Lucasta (Paulette Goddard)is disowned by her cruel father, Joe Lucasta (Oskar Homolka) and turns into a disillusioned, despondent and wayward girl who becomes a prostitute and sinks to the depths of degradation. But she is reclaimed and reformed by the man she marries, Rudolf Strobel (William Bishop).
