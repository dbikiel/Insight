A duel of tension and harmony in a Quartet of youthful virtuosi expanding their skills on a clutch of rare Guadagninis. An exploration of the mystery and the lost, delicate art of constructing these robust masterpieces Exquisite imagery will illuminate a complex history of enduring instruments and their temporary custodians. And then there's the music!
