A radio-singer, Bing Hornsby, is none-too-concerned about his job, and an affair with Mona leads to his dismissal. When it appears Hornsby is getting and paying a lot of attention to his fianc√©e, Anita Rogers, station manager Leslie McWhinney buys the station, gives Hornsby his job back, and goes on a honeymoon with Anita.
The manager at a local radio station puts on a singer (Bing Crosby) who is immediately a hit with his listeners. The problem is that the young singer doesn't seen to be too serious-minded about his career, which becomes a matter of concern for the station management.
