A venereal disease turns an entire town of two-timing mothers into cannibals!
For some strange reason, never explained, a few of the local PTA-going mom's suddenly turn on their offspring. For much of the film they walk around town, looking mutated and making unfunny wisecracks.
In a small town, the mothers unexpectedly become cannibals, eating their husbands and children. The police officer Cylde McDormick kills his ex-wife when she attacks him after eating their son, but the chief of police Dixon accuses McDormick and arrests him. Meanwhile a group of sons and daughters flee from their mothers. When McDormick escapes from prison, he meets the coroner Dr. Lee Grouly (Michael Fuer) that believes in him. Dr. Grouly researches the tissue from McDormick's ex-wife and his nurse Felicia Dodd discovers a venereal virus and the antidote. Meanwhile Dixon sends Officer Hitchcock to kill McDormick. What is Dixon hiding?
After sleeping around with the town's population of mothers, a man spreads a cannibalistic venereal disease to each woman. The result is a horrific display of flesh eaters as they turn on their children for food. The teens must somehow inject the antidote into the rearend of their own mothers before they too become Sunday dinner.
