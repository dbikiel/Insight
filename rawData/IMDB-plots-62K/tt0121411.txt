Three attendees at a puppet theater don various roles in order to sing a variety of songs by Jacques Brel, all while hippies and other eccentrics cavort about them.
Jacques Brel Is Alive, etc. once toured American and European theatres. The show is comprised of 35 songs written by the famous travelling troubedor Jacques Brell (who also stars in the film version). The film centers on various aspects of life (love, marriage, death, war, etc.).
