In order to appease his firm, Suk-won goes to see a psychiatrist. At the hospital he meets Jin-young, a skittish woman he is inexplicably drawn to even as she does her best to steer clear him. As Suk-won investigates both his own past and Mrs. Kim's case the tragic truth of his and Jin-young's enduring connection to each other is revealed, bringing Suk-won full circle in a story of loss and the pain of remembrance.
