ENTRANCE is about the limits of our perception, how the things lurking on the periphery of our lives can lead to horrific conclusions; about how she fell out of love with the city, but it wouldn't let her go.
ENTRANCE is about how the simple darkness on the edges of our lives can so easily give way to the naked horror of existence. The film explores the destructive nature of paranoia and the limits of perception. It is an intimate character study directed by Dallas Hallam and Patrick Horvath with a formalist restraint. The subtle performances throughout are buttressed by Suziey Block, whose fearless execution injects both terror and poise as ENTRANCE climbs from spark to inferno.From the 2011 Los Angeles Film Festival Website: When Suziey mysteriously loses her beloved dog, a creeping anxiety begins to set in and she decides shes had enough of L.A. But on the night of her going-away party, Suziey finds out that leaving might not be so easy.A remarkably deft blending of genres, this character-study-meets-horror-flick is a true East Side collaboration. Suziey the Silverlake barista really is Suziey the Silverlake barista (and a gifted actress) and the rambling hillside home she inhabits onscreen was director Dallas Hallams rental during shooting. But whats most remarkable about Hallam and Patrick Horvaths directorial debut is the unshakable sense of dread it evokes. Be warnedyou may not sleep so well once youve experienced Entrance.
