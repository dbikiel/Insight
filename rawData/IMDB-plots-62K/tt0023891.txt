A famous female flier and a member of Parliament drift into a potentially disastrous affair.
At a party for Bright Young Things, a "treasure hunt" for attractive yet virtuous people nets Sir Christopher Strong, M.P., and Lady Cynthia Darrington, dashing aviatrix. Their acquaintance is innocent at first; but after he sees her in a spectacular silver moth costume, virtue begins to wane. Against their wills, they are drawn into an affair whose consequences threaten Strong's happy marriage and both their careers.
Member of Parliament Sir Christopher Strong and his wife, Lady Elaine Strong, are a happily married and proper British couple. They have few problems in their lives, except Elaine worrying about their twenty year old daughter, Monica Strong, and her gallivanting around to all hours of the morning with her friends, a particularly troublesome one being already married Harry Rawlinson. Indeed, Monica hopes Harry will get a divorce from his wife so that the two of them can be married. These problems are why Chris and Elaine are happy that Monica befriends aviatrix Lady Cynthia Darrington. Only slightly older than Monica, Cynthia is a strong and independent woman who has never been with a man since her work keeps her preoccupied. Elaine can see that Monica is not the only person in their household who is enamored with Cynthia, but Chris as well. In fact, as Cynthia prepares for her pioneering aviation achievements including participating in an around the world race and attempting an altitude record, Chris and Cynthia fall in love. They both realize embarking on an affair would be harmful to Chris' political career, an obstacle to Cynthia's quest for aviation world records, and hurtful to those around them. The questions become whether they can resist their romantic urges and if not, what they will do to minimize any fallout from their liaison.
