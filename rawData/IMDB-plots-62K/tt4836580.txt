In this steampunk, fantasy adventure, a collapse imprisons three dwarven miners who must now work collectively to combat starvation, despair, and a mysterious creature.
This film basically boils down to 3 guys in a cave arguing with each other for an hour and a half. And about half way through there's flashing shaky-cam footage of a fight with a mysterious creature they fight with and are scared of until near the end when the situation is resolved.
