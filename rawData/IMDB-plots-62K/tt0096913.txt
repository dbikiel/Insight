A team from the United States is going to compete against Korea in a Tae Kwon Do tournament. The team consists of fighters from all over the country--can they overcome their rivalry and work together to win?
Team USA gets rid of personal ghosts while fighting Team Korea in Taekwondo championship. "Adversity overcome" formula with excellent fighting scenes.
Comments by Actor / Writer Roy C. PetersonThe title describes the movie. It's one of the best of all the martial arts films I've seen. There's good human-conflict story content. The acting is superb. The Taekwondo fight scenes are intense, realistic, and at the end, downright heroic.After seeing this I have a new respect for the compact power of this style. I once saw and photographed (at 1/1000 of a second) a Taekwondo warrior break, with his bare hand, three slabs of concrete. I was very impressed by this, but this movie impressed me much more. I've always considered Eric Roberts to be a fine actor, but until I saw this movie I had no idea of what an accomplished athlete he is as well.
