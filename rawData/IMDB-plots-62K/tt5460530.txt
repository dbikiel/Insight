A group of strangers come to the aid of a single mother seeking to bring her rapists to justice.
Walking home with her 12-year-old daughter after midnight on the Fourth of July, Teena crosses paths with some local losers to be brutally gang raped with her daughter Bethie watching. Bethie is able to identify the rapists, but when the rapists hire a hot shot attorney who attacks Teena's character, Dromoor, a local police officer who was first on the scene when police were called, starts to take matters into his own hands.
