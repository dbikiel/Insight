Residents of a friendly Pennsylvania town foil three brothers' plan to rob a bank on Christmas Eve.
Bill Firpo has managed to stay honest, but can't help but be dragged into things by his larcenous brothers, the clever Dave and the kleptomaniac Alvin. When the three find a bank so easy to rob that they can't resist, the only question is whether or not they can get out of town before the big snowstorm hits. While the three brothers run around town with their stolen loot, they are beseiged with the kindness of the townfolk that might just set them on the path of rightousness.
Though tempted by crime, Bill Firpo has managed to stay on the right road, unlike his jailbird brothers, compulsive liar Dave and kleptomaniac Alvin. After overcrowding leads to an early parole for Dave and Alvin, they get Bill to take them to Paradise, PA., where on Christmas Eve, the three brothers pull off the easiest bank robbery imaginable. Leaving the literally nice-little-town of Paradise, though, is not as easy as they imagined...
