The Tree is a chamber piece drama that vivisects family values, almost like in ancient tragedies determined by doom.
One story, three angles. In three chapters, the film's plot is told through the eyes of two brothers and their mother Milena as we witness a tragic situation which befalls the family as the result of an accident. The two sons, adolescent Alek and his younger sibling Veli, are unable to leave their house, the only place where they feel safe. After a period of time, however, their refuge becomes a prison for the boys.
