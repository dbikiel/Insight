After stopping three crooks from robbing an innocent woman, two dimwits become crime fighters.
It starts off seriously enough, with three thugs robbing an innocent young woman at night in the city, but then switches to Vin Saxon and Carolyn Brandt doing a goofy Elvis-like rock 'n roll number (very charming though). The next day the thugs are bored. Picking a name at random out of the phone book, they decide to terrorize Carolyn Brandt. After some campy dramatic scenes, she is kidnapped by the goons. They decide to ransom her. After receiving the ransom call, Vin Saxon and the good-natured, but not- to-bright gardener sit around despondent, wondering what to do. "There's only one thing to do!" exclaims Vin. The two rush off into the next room and become the costumed heroes Rat Pfink and Boo Boo...
Cee Bee Beaumont, girlfriend of rock n' roll star Lonnie Lord, is kidnapped by the dastardly Chain Gang, forcing Lonnie to take action. He and his friend Titus Twimbly transform themselves into the masked marvels Rat Pfink &amp; Boo Boo, the champions of down-trodden, harassed and just plain put-upon women and children everywhere. Unleashing their trusty metal steed The Ratcycle, the dynamic duo begin their search for Cee Bee, checking out go-go parties where rock n' roll-besotted youth dance the watusi. Narrowly escaping many dangers, Rat Pfink &amp; Boo Boo defeat the Chain Gang and rescue Cee Bee, but their pleasure in a job well down is cut short when they are threatened by Kogar the Ape, who has escaped from a local zoo. After defeating the rampaging primate, the three are the celebrants at a parade held in their honor. "Rat Pfink a Boo Boo" is a Crime-Stoppers Textbook classic that proves that the American Way always triumphs over vice in the end.
