A poor community in the remote state of Espirito Santo, Brazil, ekes an existence by fishing and picking crustaceans from the local tropical mangroves. Their meagre survival gradually becomes threatened by pollution of their waters and the eminent disappearance of the source of their livelihood. Suddenly, from the contaminated muddy dark swamp, zombie-like creatures emerge to attack the community. One by one people are ravaged and killed by the zombie creatures... A frightened timid survivor discovers a swift ability with the machete - but what poor and timid talent as a lover.
In a polluted mangrove swamp, the locals recall the time when they could fish and catch mud crabs to sell and feed their families and themselves in their isolated community; now the swamp is dead and they can hardly find a fish or a crab in the dirty water. During a night, dead bodies raise from the swamp, attacking and biting the dwellers that transform into aggressive zombies. The local Lu√≠s fights against the monsters to survive and save the life of Raquel, on whom he has a crush.
