In 1950s Mexico, a famous bullfighter loses his nerve after he's injured and witnesses the death of another matador in the ring.
Bullfighter Luis Bello (Mel Ferrer) is a star, but fear and doubt strike quickly after he is injured in the ring. Manager Raul Fuentes (Anthony Quinn) refuses to let him give up, though, pushing Luis to overcome his doubt and remain a matador. Luis agrees, but complications ensue when he falls for Raul's girlfriend, Linda (Miroslava). Things get even worse after a tragic accident and a public embarrassment. Now, to salvage his dignity, Luis needs one last shot in the ring.
