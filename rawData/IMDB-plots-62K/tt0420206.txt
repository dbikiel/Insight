A close friendship between two crew teammates is tested when one slowly discovers he's gay and attracted to the other.
Tobi and Achim, the pride of the local crew club, have been the best of friends for years and are convinced that nothing will ever stand in the way of their friendship. They look forward to the upcoming summer camp and the crew competition. Achim's girlfriend Sandra is on the girl's team and he enjoys spending more time with her. Tobi becomes increasingly skeptical of their relationship. Anke, the pretty girl who has fallen for Tobi, doesn't make things any easier, then the gay team from Berlin arrives and Tobi is totally confused. The storm that breaks out the evening before the race begins is more than meteorological in this sensitive story about the complexities of growing up.
Tobi and Achim have been best mates for years. As cox and oarsman, they have lead their rowing club to win several rowing cups in the past and now look forward to win a big regatta in the countryside of Germany, but this trip isn't your usual summer camp experience, and problems soon arise. As Achim's relationship with his girlfriend Sandra, who's also on the team, grows more and more serious, Tobi starts to realize that his feelings for Achim run much deeper than he's willing to admit to himself. He feels confused, unsure of himself and increasingly left out by his friend Alex and the team. When Sandra's best friend Anke shows her interest in him, his anxiety starts to grow. When it turns out that the much-anticipated Berlin girls' team has been replaced by a team of athletic, clich√©-bursting young gay men, Tobi and his teammates are suddenly forced to grapple with their prejudices, their fears and, perhaps, their hidden longings. As the tension grows, Tobi, Achim and the others head toward a confrontation as fierce and liberating as the summer storm that's gathering over the lake, and Tobi realizes he has to start facing some facts about himself he didn't dare to face before.
