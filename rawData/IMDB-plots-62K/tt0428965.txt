A beautiful Jewish young woman still living with her orthodox family in a Parisian suburb, falls in love with a Muslim co-worker.
The Tunisian-French Laura is a young woman that lives with her Orthodox Jewish family in the Jewish community in the suburbs of Paris. Her mother is a widow that left Tunisia; her sister Mathilde is having troubles in her marriage because she repressed her sexual desire based on her misunderstandings of the principles of her religion. Laura is an open minded student of philosophy and works cleaning a school in the nightshift. While Laura feels a strong passion and desire for her Muslin Algerian colleague, her sister finds that her husband had an affair with a woman and looks for an advisor that helps her to interpret the true meaning of love and the duties of a married woman.
Two sisters - Tunisian Jews living in a suburb of Paris - navigate tradition and desire. Laura, 19, a serious student of philosophy, tries to live a life of thought, elevating herself above passion and traditional religion. She finds herself attracted to a Moslem man with whom she works. Matilde, older, is married with four children; she discovers that her husband has a lover. Should she divorce him? Despair sends both women search for wisdom - from an attendant at the mikvah and from their mother. Can either find wisdom or happiness?
