An academic in meteorology must decide between her new job as a popular weather girl and her pursuit of her PhD and fellowship. Is her handsome boss interested in her true self or just as a ticket to a network job in New York?
Serious academic in meteorology finishing her PhD dissertation and a fellowship is recruited to fill in as an on-air weather girl. While she is a big hit with the public she is risking her reputation with her colleagues. A glamorous make-over helps her come out of her shell but her new job also takes her away from her studies at a critical time. Deb must decide whether her career path lies with academia or sharing her passion for the weather with the public and a new romance with her attractive boss.
Deb Metcalfe, a modest meteorology grad student, has her heart set on earning a highly competitive fellowship position with her University. When a series of unlikely events finds Deb with an opportunity to report the weather on the local TV news, her mentor, Dr. Harris, encourages her to use the job to build up her public profile and better her chances at the fellowship. However, as Deb grows more invested in the station and its dynamic news director, Quentin Sterling, her friends and school work begin to play second fiddle. Quentin believes in her star potential and encourages her to sign on permanently with the station. But Deb soon begins to wonder if Quentin is telling her everything there is to know. Is television stardom what she truly wants? Both Quentin and Deb find they must make difficult choices between love and career, and when slimy news producer Josh further complicates matters with his own agenda, it could end up costing them both everything they have ever wanted.
