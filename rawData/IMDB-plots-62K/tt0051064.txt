A crazed female scientist uses nerve gas to turn local teenagers into her unquestioning slaves.
Teenagers Reg, Skip, Julie and Pam go out for an afternoon of water skiing on a nice day. They come ashore on an island that is being used as a testing center for a scientist and agents from "an eastern power." They seek to turn the people of the United States into easily controlled zombie like creatures. The agents steal Reg's boat, stranding the teens on the island. The four friends are then held captive in cages able only to speculate on their fate. Though they have already been testing the formula on convicts and drunks, the enemy scientist and agents plan to conduct final tests on the teens before they use it on the rest of America. Meanwhile, two of their friends, whom the captives had planned to meet later, search for their missing friends. After a series of suspicious encounters, they urge the corrupt sheriff to search the island where their friends are trapped.
Six teenagers, Regg, Julie, Skip, Pam, Morrie and Dot, are planning a water-skiing afternoon aboard Regg's speedboat. Pepper suggests a visit to an unknown island, with Morrie and Dot joining the other four later. After lunch, the quartet goes exploring and find odd-behaving people moving about the island, and, later, a strange old house hidden among the trees. In that remote fastness, Myra, a doctor of sorts, has been experimenting with humans, striving to come up with a slave-race via nerve-gas that induces a zombie-like state. Morrie and Dot, curious over their friend's long absence, bring the town sheriff. He shrugs off the incident (for monetary gain), thereby disclosing hie allegiance with the mad scientist. Regg takes charge.
