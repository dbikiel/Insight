Lydia MacMillan, a wealthy old woman who has never married, is invited by an old beau, Dr. Michael Fitzpatrick, for a reunion with the men who have been in her life to reminisce about the times when they were young and courted her. In memory, each romance seemed splendid and destined for happiness, but in each case, Lydia realizes, the truth was less romantic, and ill-starred.
Michael Fitzpatrick goes to see his old flame Lydia MacMillan after he hears about her enormous success with her life-long charity work. Since they have not seen each other for over forty years they have much to reminisce about so he invites her to his house for tea later in the week. When she arrives Michael has surprised her by orchestrating a reunion of her old suitors. The film mostly through flash backs shows her relationships with these men and explains how their lives turned out.
