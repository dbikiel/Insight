A band-leader assembles an orchestra by mystifying means.
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight for your entertainment pleasure we have the world's most extraordinary band conductor and his one-man orchestra. Watch the unbelievable act of cloning before your very eyes, as the virtuoso of illusion duplicates himself, not once, but six times to conjure a formidable instrumental band, complete with their chairs and musical instruments. This is a must-see performance that no one should miss.
A band-leader has arranged seven chairs for the members of his band. When he sits down in the first chair, a cymbal player appears in the same chair, then rises and sits in the next chair. As the cymbal player sits down, a drummer appears in the second chair, and then likewise moves on to the third chair. In this way, an entire band is soon formed, and is then ready to perform.
