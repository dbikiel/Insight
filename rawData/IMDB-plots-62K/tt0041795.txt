An aspiring actress finds herself in a jam when a gangster, who is backing the show she is in, is found dead in her apartment.
Eleanor Collier wants to become a successful actress and agrees to a series of publicity stunts thought up by her press agent, Charley Baxter. The result is trouble and a bad impression. Eleanor quarrels with her boyfriend when he blames her publicity mania for getting her involved in an underworld killing. A gangster kidnaps her for being, unwittingly, the finger woman in the killing, but a Boradway columnist comes to her rescue.
