Four friends growing up in Oslo in the sixties, who occasionally think of themselves as the Fab Four. Based on the best selling book by Lars Saabye Christensen.
Four teenage boys come of age in Oslo at the time when Beatlemania hit Norway. Kim, Gunnar, Ola and Seb each take on one of the Fab Four's names and plan to start their own band during a time of great political upheaval. At the same time, they blunder through their formative years in ways all at once endearing, entertaining, and heartbreaking. The boys struggle with archaic textbooks and ancient teachers, attempt to be rebellious, and, of course, discover girls. Based on Lars Saabye Christensen's beloved bestseller of the same title, Beatles hits all the right notes with a familiar soundtrack (scored by Magne Furuholmen, keyboardist of the synthpop/rock band a-ha) and nostalgic recollection of losing innocence and the importance of friendship.
BEATLES is the ultimate coming-of-age story. The voluminous 1984 novel is one of Norways all-time greatest literary sales successes. It became Lars Saabye Christensens definitive breakthrough as an author.The bittersweet story is about four young Oslo grade seven boys hooked on The Beatles music, who are about to leap into a strange adult world ca 1968. Kim, who is rather weird and has a habit of lying, desperately tries to figure out his life. Along with the other boys, he lets his hair grow long and tries to navigate the new political terrain. They rebel against their parents and listen to the new music. Change usually happens gradually, and so too with the four boys and their friendship. Their innocence is lost and cannot be won back. But the story concludes that real friendship remains solid and that no band in the world is greater than The Beatles.
