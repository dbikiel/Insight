Espen "Ash Lad", a poor farmer's son, embarks on a dangerous quest with his brothers to save the princess from a vile troll known as the Mountain King - in order to collect a reward and save his family's farm from ruin.
Nordic king Erik orders his heiress Kristian, who turned down all suitors, to marry Danish prince Fredrik (Frederic) before her 18th birthday, as legend holds she'll otherwise fall to the 'mountain king' of trolls. Instead she makes a fugue into the very mountains, and the king promises her hand and royal dowry to whoever rescues her. Prince Fredrik sets out with his burly retainers, but faces unexpected competition from three peasant brothers. Playful, clumsy Espen Askeladd (ash lad') always tested his farmer father's patience, unable to get any chores done, but is just chased in disgrace after 'accidentally' burning down the homestead. His strict eldest brother Per and glutton middle brother Pal set out to search for the princess to earn enough to rebuild the farm, and finding Espen trail along allow him to join. He picks up seemingly useless objects and earns, by kindness to a witch, a magical map. Their party and the prince's rival bitterly while facing dangers on the road to the troll king, who isn't there only magical challenge.
