A college co-ed tries to balance her time writing songs and dealing with her publisher who tries to pursue her.
The administrators of Wyndham Girl's College believe their institution is the model of traditional values, proper decorum and girl's deportment. There is however a thriving underground movement at the college of rock music. When the administrators learn just prior to the Christmas break that one of their students, Terry Taylor, is a renowned rock music songwriter using the pseudonym Joanie Harper whose songs contain seductively feminist lyrics, they have to decide how to deal with Terry, an otherwise academically bright student, and this possible scandal to the school. Meanwhile, many of the students head to Sun Valley for the Christmas break. Among those at the resort are the college's benefactor, Senator Hubert Morrison, who is conflicted between what he believes is Terry's immoral stance and courting the youth vote through their unofficial leader Terry, and Gary Underwood, Terry's publisher. Gary is trying to get Terry to do something she considers amoral and against her feminist sensibilities, but Gary will stop at nothing to get what he wants all in the goal of selling her music. But Gary is also attracted to Terry and tries to get her to change her mind more about him as a person than what he has asked her to do.
Terry is a student at a conservative all-girls college whom writes best-selling songs under a pseudonym. When her extracurricular activities are discovered, she's suspended from school until after Christmas in which she blames her publisher, Gary, for blowing her cover. When a prominent U.S. senator arrives at the college for an overview, and to flirt with Terry's dance teacher Marge, Gary managed to rally Terry and her friends to show support with her songs to get her remitted back to school while romance begins on their minds as well.
