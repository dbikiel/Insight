With a help of good nature a young brave girl goes to the dark forest for saving her youngest brother abducted by Baba Yaga.
Leaving for the fair, the parents instructed their daughter Masha to look after her brother Vanya and take care of him. The girl frivolously left him to sit in the courtyard, while she ran away to play with the girlfriends. Suddenly, the swan geese swooped in, grabbed Vanya from the yard and carried him to the mistress Baba Yaga. There is nothing to do - you need to help out a brother, and the sister went into the woods, looking for a hut on chicken legs. On the way, she helped the stove, the apple tree and the river, which, in turn, sheltered her from the chase, when she ran away from Baba Yaga and her swan geese with Vanechka.
