A retired cop blackmails ex burglar Bernice into paying him $20,000 - thus burgling. Paid to get a dentist's jewelry back from her ex's apartment, someone murders the ex and Bernice is a suspect. She investigates.
Bernice "Bernie" Rhodenbarr is a burglar by trade, and she runs a bookstore as well. Her friend Carl Hefler is a dog groomer. After a successful burglary, it's discovered that a dead body was in the house she burgled. As she's the only one who can be placed at the scene of the crime, she has to use her criminal skills to clear her name of the murder AND avoid getting charged with the burglary.
Bernice Rhodenbarr is a retired "cat burglar" who runs a used bookstore. She is lured out of retirement when a retired cop (who busted her before) demands money to keep quiet about some evidence he withheld in one of her prior jobs. She agrees to a burglary job for a lady dentist, but theft leads to murder, and it's up to Bernice to try to prove her innocence.
