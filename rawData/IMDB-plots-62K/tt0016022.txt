Lightnin' Bill Jones, a man partial to the bottle, does chores and odd jobs around the Calivada Hotel, which is run by his wife and their adopted daughter, Millie. Real estate hucksters, learning that the hotel stands on a proposed railroad right of way, talk Mother Jones into selling the land, but, on the advice of John Marvin, a young lawyer in love with Millie, Bill refuses to sign the bill of sale. Mother Jones orders him from the house, and he goes to live in the Old Soldiers' Home. The schemers persuade Mother Jones to divorce Bill, and she takes him to court. Mother Jones has a change of heart, however, and is reconciled with Bill. The schemers are arrested, and John and Millie become engaged.
