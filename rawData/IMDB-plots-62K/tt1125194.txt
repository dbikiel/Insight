Tells the story of Delta Nu Sorority Sister Elle Woods, and her amazing trip in pursuit of sexy man Warner Huntington III. Along the way she meets friends Emmett, Paulette, and all her Delta Nus see her through.
Perennially perky Elle Woods is a girl who loves to be pampered and shop for the latest all-pink outfits (and matching handbags, of course). But don't let this seemingly ditsy fashionista fool you, this sorority sister is smarter than she seems and doesn't take "no" for an answer. So when her boyfriend dumps her for someone "more serious," Elle sets out to win him back by putting down the credit card and hitting the books. Ready to revamp her image, Elle goes where no Delta Nu sorority girl has gone before: Harvard Law School! Takes you from the sorority house to the halls of justice with Broadway's blondest new student, that daredevil in high heels Elle Woods (who has the cutest sidekick in the world, her Chihuahua Bruiser). Along the way, our heroine proves that being yourself and going after what you want never goes out of style.
