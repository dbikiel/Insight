Country boy Mikko Syv√§rivi lands a job as a floor manager at the TV studios in Helsinki. He finds no place to stay in the capital, so he works as night guard. Ambitious Mikko writes some material of his own, but becomes an instant TV success after failing comically in a small role, which leads to a series of TV shows based on slapstick door tricks. But when he decides to raise his act onto a new level - window tricks! - his ratings plummet and the show is put off the air. Love and money fly out the window too, but Mikko won't give up easily.
