After inheriting the family mortuary, a pyrophobic mortician accidentally exposes hundreds of un-cremated bodies to toxic medical waste. As the corpses re-animate, the mortician's inheritance-seeking younger brother unexpectantly shows up, stumbling upon a full zombie outbreak!
This movie is about Gerald Tovar Jr. and his Mortuary which his father left to him after he died. He is taking in bodies and toxic waste which the Government has been dropping there for years for a cash incentive. But the waste oozes on to some of the bodies causing them to become "re-animated", or zombies if you like, which of course causes other problems for the staff that work there. Things start to get out of hand...
