Dan works for Pritchard and Pritchard out of San Francisco and is in love with Maisie, referred to as "the icebox" by his news reporter friend. As one of his ships returns to San Francisco, Dan learns that the Captain has contracted Leprosy and asks Dan to be the guardian of his South Sea island daughter Tamea. Dan soon learns that Tamea wants him and will do nothing without a kiss. But Tamea soon learns that she is different than Dan and Maisie and that makes her angry. Dan decides to go and live on the island with Tamea, but soon finds out that Paradise is not everything that he thought it was.
Dan Pritchard operates his family's owned San Francisco based shipping company. He and socialite Maisie Morrison are in love with each other, although she has yet to set a date for their wedding in not wanting him to take her for granted. Dan's father's best friend, a French Polynesian ship captain named Larrieau, asks Dan to take care of his daughter Tamea when circumstances dictate that he can no longer be in her life, to which Dan agrees. Dan takes Tamea into his home and gets Maisie and his household servants to try and transform her into western societal norms. In the process, sexually open Tamea, in her lusty tropical sense, falls in love with Dan. Dan eventually falls under her spell as well. If Dan succumbs fully to Tamea, the question then becomes if there is a long term future for them as they will have to live in either his world or her world, both vastly different especially with regard to the mores around what it means to love and be in love.
