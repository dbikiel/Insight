In 1940, an American claiming to be Canadian volunteers for the British Army's paratroop school.
Alan Ladd is the focus of this story based on the wartime raid on the German radar station at Bruneval. The raid was a combined services operation and the 2nd Battalion of the 1st Parachute Brigade was led by Major 'John Frost' (Major Snow). An RAF radar expert, Flight Sergeant C.W.H. Cox (Sergeant Box) accompanied the raiders to tell them what to take back to England.
Steve MacKendrick, now known as Canada, shows up in 1940 as a volunteer for paratroop school. He obviously has a good deal more background and leadership skills than he lets on. With Major Snow wounded, MacKendrick must assume command if his troop is to survive.
