In Oregon, the Army is ordered to negotiate peace with the Indians but unscrupulous businessmen, who profiteered during the conflict, secretly sabotage the peace process.
The Indians, under Chief Mike, have been defeating the Army in Oregon for years. The new commander, Major Archer, plans to defeat the Indians once and for all, but his orders are changed to attempt a peaceful settlement. But there are certain people who do not want Oregon to become a state and they will attempt to keep the Indians on the war path.
