Are today's advertising photographers continuing in the tradition of 17th century Flemish painters? This is one theory director Harun Farocki poses in his documentary STILL LIFE.

The filmmaker illustrates this intriguing hypothesis with three documentary sequences showing photographers at work creating a contemporary STILL LIFE: a cheese-board, beer glasses and an expensive watch.
