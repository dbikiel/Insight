After the appearance of a new Gojira (Godzilla), the Japanese government builds a robotic Godzilla from the bones of the original monster that attacked Tokyo in 1954 to stop the beast.
To protect Japan from yet another monster attack, this time from a new and malevolent member of the Godzilla (Gojira) species, the Japanese government creates a human-piloted cyborg, codenamed Kiriyu, using the skeleton of the original Godzilla (Gojira) that attacked Japan in 1954.
As a typhoon is raging across Japan, and a loud roar alerts the populace that they are once again being visited by a rampaging monster. The military manages to drive the beast back into the ocean, but another attack looks inevitable. In preparation, the Ministry of Science designs Kiriyu, a enormous lizard-like robot constructed from the bones of the first giant monster that attacked Tokyo almost fifty years earlier. Sure enough, just as the finishing touches are being put on Kiriyu, the real monster comes back to settle some old scores. Will the team of crack soldiers at Kiriyu's controls have what it takes to keep Shinagawa, and all of Japan, monster-free?
