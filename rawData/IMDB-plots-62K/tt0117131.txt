Not Love Just Frenzy is a fast and funny adventure through the wild Euro club scene in the style of the scandalous Pedro Almodovar! A group of hot and horny twentysomething friends looking for love at Madrid's hottest disco get tangled up in a maze of wild sex, drugs and gunfights as they encounter flashy drag queens, self-absorbed gigolos and a whole host of other outrageous characters. Accompanied by a dynamite soundtrack and starring many of Spain's top young actors, including appearances by Penelope Cruz (Vanilla Sky), Javier Bardem (Before Night Falls) and Bibi Andersen (Kika) as a high-class lesbian pimp, "Not Love Just Frenzy" is too hip to miss.
