A new chief of a "Culture House" is planning to hold a terribly boring New Year concert. A group of young amateur actors are doing their best to liven up the concert.
Employees of the House of Culture are preparing for the annual event - costumed Christmas carnival. The entertainment program includes solo, dance and circus acts, as well as performances of a jazz orchestra, a magician and clowns. Serafim Ivanovich Ogurtsov, appointed acting director of the House of Culture, having familiarized himself with the program, did not approve it, since, as he believes, everything must be done at a high level and thoroughly.
