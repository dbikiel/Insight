The Emmy Award-winning Robot Chicken returns with its third send-up of the Star Wars universe! In this all-new hour-long special, four very different characters -- Emperor Palpatine, Darth Vader, Boba Fett and Gary the Stormtrooper -- reveal untold stories that weave and interconnect throughout all six Star Wars films! Set phasers to "fun"! Oh wait, that's the wrong franchise.
