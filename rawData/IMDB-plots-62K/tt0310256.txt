Story about a friendship between two lonely, opposite souls. One is a 81-year-old grumpy widower and the other an insecure eighteen-year-old refugee from Sudan.
Majok is a refugee from Africa, and lives in a refugee center where he can not settle, so he often sleeps on a park bench. One morning he wakes up on a bench somewhere in the meadow. There is the old Jacob standing before him who grumbling shouts that it is his bench. That does not matter to Majok and he will return to the same bench more often. As the two meet more and more often, a close friendship arises between the two, which is strange because they do not understand each other, Jakob even invites him to his home.
