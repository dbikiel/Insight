John Paul Steckler was the Junior Officer aboard a destroyer when WWII ended. He gets stuck with the job of sailing the ship to the states to be decommissioned. Now years latter, no one knows where the ship is. He has a choice. Find the ship, or pay for it, Now! If only Prudence, to whom he just got married, could understand why he isn't there for his Honeymoon.
The United States Navy is asking the government for new appropriations. Now a Congressman Mandeville, who wants to turn them down, thinks he has the means--one of their vessels, a destroyer escort is unaccounted for. Now the last man who was in command of it, is John Paul Steckler VII, who comes from a long line who naval goof-ups. So Admiral Bludde sends for him and when he is brought before them, he is told that unless he can tell them where the vessel is, he stands to face charges. It seems that after the war, he was placed in command, cause he was lowest ranking officer, and after getting caught by Japanese soldiers, who were unaware that the war was over, and being mistakenly believed to be dead, his crew left him, and when he returned he sign the ship out. So along with Ensign Benson, he tries to find out where his ship went.
