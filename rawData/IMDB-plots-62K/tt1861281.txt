'Battle for Brooklyn' follows the story of reluctant activist Daniel Goldstein as he struggles to save his home and community from being demolished to make way for the densest real estate development in U.S. history. Along the way, he falls in love, gets married and starts a family while living in an abandoned building located at the heart of the project site. Over the course of seven years, Daniel and his community fight tenaciously in the courts, the streets, and the media to stop the abuse of eminent domain and reveal the corruption at the heart of the plan.
