Just after losing her husband to a similar condition, Dr. Anne Turner (Dame Julie Walters) is diagnosed with a fatal neurological condition. So she plans to end her life herself. Based on a true story.
Dame Julie Walters stars in a one-off drama inspired by the true story of Dr. Anne Turner, who, in 2006, took her own life in a Zurich clinic having developed an incurable degenerative disease. Having recently witnessed the death of her husband from a neurological disease, Anne Turner is diagnosed with a nearly identical illness and determines to end her life once her condition has reached a critical point. As her health deteriorates, Anne's son and two daughters struggle to reach a consensus over their mother's intentions, and while they search for alternative options, silent recriminations and stubborn practicality threaten to tear the family apart. With her family at logger heads, Anne must also face the fury of her best friend, whose opposing views bring them into direct conflict.
