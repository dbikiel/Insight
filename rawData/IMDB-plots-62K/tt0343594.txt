When 30-year-old Stefania breaks up with her boyfriend Andrea, little does she realize what the summer has in store for her. She winds up on vacation at the Greek resort 'Isle of Love' with her 15-year-old niece. Unfortunately, her teenage niece has something more than sun and surf on her mind; she decides that this Mediterranean paradise is where she will finally lose her virginity. However, in an ironic twist, the cute guy she has her eye out on turns out to be none other than Andrea, her aunt's ex-boyfriend. This light-hearted "comedy-of-errors" is a valuable lesson in what being a woman means at any age.
