An aging American ninja master and his headstrong young apprentice search for the elder man's daughter.
John Peter Macallister was a Korean veteran who, after serving, decided to live in Japan, and, while there, he studied Ninjitsu and became a Ninja. Thirty years later, he learned that he has a daughter, so left to find her. Apparently, though, he can't leave the sect that he is with, because it means that he is now marked for death. He manages to escape, and, upon arriving in the States, he meets Max Keller, a drifter who has a penchant for getting involved with other people's problems and helping them out if he can. Max and Macallister hook up, with Max helping Macallister find his daughter, and Macallister teaching him the ways of the ninja. At the same time, evading Okasa, one of Macallister's students, who is now sworn to kill him.
