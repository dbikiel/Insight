Ruth's been brainwashed by a guru in Delhi, India. Her parents in Sydney hire a specialist in reversing this. Ruth is tricked to return to Australia and is isolated in an outback cabin with the specialist. It gets messy.
While on a journey of discovery in exotic India, beautiful young Ruth Barron falls under the influence of a charismatic religious guru. Her desperate parents then hire P.J. Waters, a macho cult de-programmer who confronts Ruth in a remote desert hideaway. But P.J. quickly learns that he's met his match in the sexy, intelligent, and iron-willed Ruth.
Based in Sans Souci, Sydney, Australia, Ruth Barron and her friend go on a trip to Delhi, India, where Ruth attends a Hindu religious ceremony, and decides to stay put. Ruth's mother, Miriam, travels to Chandni Chowk, Delhi, where she meets with Ruth, and is appalled at the condition she is living in. She tells Ruth that her father has had a stroke and may not survive. A Saree-clad Ruth, who now calls herself Naznee, initially refuses, but relents and accompanies her mother back home. Once at home, she adorns her room with pictures of Bhagwan Shri Shiv, Bhagwan Shri Kishan and Devi Maa Lakshmi, and she will soon find out that the real reason for her return is to spend time alone in a half way hut in the desert in the company of an renowned 'Cult Exiter' PJ Waters - and it is after this encounter that everyone's lives will change forever.
