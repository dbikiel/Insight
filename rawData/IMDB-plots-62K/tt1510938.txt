Through a chance encounter, two men of opposing ideologies deliberate spiritual, philosophical, and profound matters in a New York City apartment.
Two men in an apartment with their opposing beliefs in this play by Cormac McCarthey. The black guy, a former convict who believes in God, just saved the white atheist professor from jumping in front of the express train. He won't let the depressed man leave, without following him, and feel he's in this situation for a reason, decided by God. An intense chamber play about belief or unbelief, and a conversation about what's true and important in life, or not.
Set in a New York tenement apartment, the story focuses on two very different men a deeply religious black ex-con (Samuel L. Jackson) who thwarts the suicide attempt of an asocial white college professor (Tommy Lee Jones) who tried to throw himself in front of an oncoming subway train, The Sunset Limited.
