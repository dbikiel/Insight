A cartoonist defies reality when he draws objects that become three-dimensional after he lifts them off his sketch pad.
An easel holds a sketch pad upon which Blackton draws a cartoonish face of a man. He makes the cartoon react by giving it wine, cigars, and a top hat. Objects magically go into the drawing--becoming part of the cartoon image, and out of the drawing--becoming physical objects again.
From the father of American animation, J. Stuart Blackton, this mixture of a silent film and stop-motion animation, brings the viewer in front of a large easel, as the artist sketches the portrait of a fine gentleman in quick and bold strokes. As if by magic and much to our surprise, the two-dimensional objects on the canvas escape into our world, assuming a real form, as the facial expressions on the man in the picture succeed one another. Indeed, this is an enchanted drawing.
