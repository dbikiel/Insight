Childhood friends Bruno and Lalo are inseparable, until Lisa enters their lives. Beautiful and free-spirited, she quickly turns both their heads, igniting a passionate but heartbreaking love triangle - before suddenly leaving town without a word. Lisa resurfaces much later; Bruno is married and Lalo divorced, and none have them have been able to completely shake their memories of that summer 30 years ago. When Lisa reunites the group, those old feelings are stirred - and relived.
