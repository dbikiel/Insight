A painter fakes his death, in order to gain some additional money, because his works would revaluate with his death. But, unfortunately, he is killed a few hours after having "returned to life".
Recently-deceased painter Truman York turns up alive when paintings supposedly painted by him show up. He goes to the gallery where they're being sold and slashes them. He then goes to his dealer to find out where these paintings are coming from. Later, a guy whose wife was killed in the accident that he was supposedly killed in shows up looking for him. He goes to his wife and asks her to let him stay in her apartment; later he is killed. The guy is arrested and he calls his friend Ken Malansky for help, and Ken calls Perry.
