Old friends Ward and Phillip both become smitten with Phillip's mother's attractive young secretary Stella. But Stella marries Phillip and stands by him as his behavior becomes more and more erratic and his jealousy of Ward increases.
Stella Bergen, the personal secretary and companion to widowed Mrs. Monrell, accepts the marriage proposal of Mrs. Monrell's son, Philip Monrell. Both the proposal and its acceptance are a bit of a surprise since Philip seemed to encourage a relationship between his childhood friend, Ward Andrews, and Stella. Stella seemed equally as interested in pursuing that relationship with Ward. After Stella and Philip get married, Philip assumes the lead management role in the family's steel business, which had previously been run by his mother following his father's death. The way that he runs the business and the marriage bring to the surface insecurities in Philip. Philip's behavior becomes increasingly erratic, which belies the true nature of what Philip's plans are for himself, Ward and Stella. A Dr. Rameau, who knew Philip when Philip was passing through Paris, may be able to shed some light on the proceedings.
