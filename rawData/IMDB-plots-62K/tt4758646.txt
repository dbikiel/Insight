An idiosyncratic general confronts opposition from enemies, allies, and bureaucrats while leading a massive rebuilding operation in Afghanistan.
A general from the U.S. is sent to Afghanistan to "clean" the situation up after eight years of war in the country. He finds himself among tired soldiers and disillusioned politicians eager to leave. In this situation, he feels his mission is to "win" the war, something deemed impossible by everyone around him.
A tough general, hardened in his ways, knowledgeable about counterinsurgency operations, finds himself up against his own government and troops, confused about his own purpose, and without a clear plan of how to deal with the politics of "nation-building".
A general with prior experience is sent to Afghanistan with a mission shrouded in vagueness, nonexistent political support and a lack of confidence from the U.S. government. However, with the team of supporters and aides that surround him, a strategic "battle" plan is set into motion that is questionable by those who already believe there is no hope, and flawless by those that are closest to him.
