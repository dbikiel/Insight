A girl arrives from London to visit her estranged relatives in a remote castle for the reading of her father's will. After a while she discovers that they are all in fact dead and her decision to live with them turns into a nightmare. Unable to leave she's drawn into a macabre underworld through visions of nude satanic rituals and her own impending sacrifice.

On the arrival, she spends the night in an inn and people tell that nobody lives at the castle. On the next morning, the mute servant Basilio brings Christina to the Montserrat castle, where she meets her weird Uncle Howard that is playing waltz on the piano and her cousin Carmencé that is painting her nails and they tell that her stepmother Herminia is on the deathbed. She visits Hermínia that tells her to leave the castle and dies. Christina also meets her Aunt Abigail and a Blind Girl and while waiting for the attorney, she entwines daydreams and nightmares with reality.
