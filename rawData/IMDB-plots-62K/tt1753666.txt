'David' tells the story of Daud, an eleven year old religious Muslim boy growing up in Brooklyn. Concealing his Muslim identity, Daud inadvertently befriends a group of Jewish boys who through a haphazard sequence of events mistake him for being Jewish and accept him as one of their own. A genuine bond of friendship is formed between Daud and Yoav, on of the Jewish boys; Daud experiences a sense of freedom, joy, and camaraderie that he has never felt before, and for a brief time enjoys being a carefree eleven year old Brooklyn boy. When the Jewish boys discover Daud's true identity, Daud's world is shattered and he is left alone, struggling to come to terms with his place in the world.
Set in Brooklyn's Bay Ridge and Borough Park, David tells the story of an friendship between two young boys -- one a devout Muslim and the other an Orthodox Jew.
Through an act of good faith, Daud, the 11-year-old son of a conservative Imam at the local mosque, befriends a group of young Yeshiva students who assume he is one of their own. Unable to resist the joys of newfound camaraderie, Daud (now David) plays along, developing a particularly close bond with a boy named Yoav. But with the inevitable unraveling of Dauds well-intentioned web of deceit, he and Yoav must confront complex emotions shaped by the realities of their related but very different cultures.Written by Joel Fendelman and Patrick Daly, David avoids stereotypes and predictability. Instead the film sensitively explores the dynamics of family and tradition that at once unite us, can also set us apart. A catalyst for self-reflection and discussion.
