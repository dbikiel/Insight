Mr. Miyagi is back and he takes a new pupil under his wing; a troubled adolescent girl.
During a commemoration for Japanese soldiers fighting in the US Army during World War II, Mr. Miyagi meets the widow of his commanding officer. He gets to know her granddaughter Julie, an angry teenager who is still feeling the pain of losing both her parents in an accident and is having problems with her grandmother and her fellow pupils. Mr. Miyagi decides to teach her karate to get her through her pain and issues and back on the right path.
In honour of the Japanese-American veteran troopers who bravely fought during WWII, the sage Karate master, Mr Miyagi, travels to Boston to attend a ceremony. There, in this unlikely place, Miyagi is introduced to the 17-year-old troubled teenage girl, Julie, who is constantly angry at the world and her abusive schoolmates, still unable to come to terms with the untimely loss of her parents. But before long, Julie will become Miyagi's new pupil, hopeful of teaching the rebellious youngster the true meaning of karate and self-esteem, through the knowledge of self-defense and respect for all living things. Could Julie be the next Karate Kid?
