The Three Mesquiteers convince a group of settlers to exchange their present property for some which, unbeknownst to our good guys, is going to be worthless. They are captured before they can warn the ranchers.
The state government plans to build a flood-control dam and condemns the property of the local farmers and ranchers, including The Three Mesquiteers. The state intends to compensate the land-owners fairly, but a crooked real-estate promoter complicates things. The ranchers, led by Stony Brooke ('John Wayne' (q)), Tucson Smith ('Ray Corrigan') and Rusty Joslin (Raymond Hatton) fight back against both the law and the crooks.
When the New Hope Valley ranchers learn their land has been condemned for construction of a new dam, they decide to fight. When they delay the construction, Proctor suggests they relocate in a desert valley that will be irrigated by a new pipeline. The dam is then completed but when the Mesquiteers check on the site, they see there was no intention of building a pipeline.
