A chronicle of the weeks after the 2000 U.S. Presidential election, and the subsequent recounts in Florida.
In this dramatization of the 2000 Presidential election, Al Gore concedes the Presidency to George W. Bush, but recants when he learns of irregularities in the Florida vote count. Democratic strategists Ronald Klain and Michael Whouley race to Florida to uncover the truth, as do Republicans under James Baker III. Between faulty voting equipment and the vagaries of Florida's Secretary of State Katherine Harris, a thirty-six-day stalemate ensues.
This movie will chronicle five weeks between the Nov. 7, 2000, presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore and the December Supreme Court ruling that upheld Florida's count and gave Bush the White House.
