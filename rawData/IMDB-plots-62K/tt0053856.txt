Bardone, a petty con man, is arrested by the Gestapo and coerced into impersonating a partisan leader in order to expose another resistance organizer.
Genoa, 1943. Grimaldi is a swindler, pretending to be a colonel in the Italian army to get money from the family of people put into jail by the Nazis. Once caught, the Gestapo makes a deal with him : he will stay alive if he impersonates the General Della Rovere, a leader of the Resistance who has just been shot by the Nazis, to be put into a political jail where he is supposed to identify another Resistance leader.
In 1943 Genoa, Emanuele Bardone, a habitual gambler and amoral swindler, is a charming petty conman who supports his addiction by posing as a middleman between the worried relatives of the Gestapo captives and the German authorities, of course, at the right price. However, when Bardone is caught in the act and his luck runs out, he will accept S.S. Colonel MÃ¼ller's offer to impersonate the recently killed General Della Rovere, a true hero of the Italian Resistance, instead of facing a firing squad. But as Emanuele enters a political prison in Milan in the hope of drawing information regarding the hidden identity of another leader of the Resistance, little by little, his new mockery will eventually awaken a slumbering conscience.
