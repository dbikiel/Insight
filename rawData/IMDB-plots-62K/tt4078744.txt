A powerful documentary - shot from March 11th, 2011 through March 2015 - that sheds some light on what really happened at the Fukushima nuclear power plant after the 2011 earthquake and the tsunami that followed.
What is it that saved Tokyo from a nuclear disaster? A pool of foreign journalists, including reporter Pio d'Emilia (Sky), is allowed to enter the Fukushima-Daiichi power plant: they have waited two years to uncover the truth about the 2011 accident hidden behind those walls. The ex-premier Naoto Kan takes us back to the days of the accident and reveals the events as they really happened. Manga animations represent Japan's history, while digital reconstruction allows for the darker side of this story, which is so complex from a social and scientific point of view, to emerge. There are no mere suspects anymore: many defendants are to be held accountable for the accident.
Even in the most organized countries like Japan, information seems to be hidden by politicians and delayed in its circulation even when the situation is the most tragic. Italian journalist Pio D'Emilia narrates in first person himself, the whole 2011 Fukushima's tragedy that had shaked the entire world, how Japan lived it and how close this country was to a catastrophe. The few chapters of this documentary show the determination of Japan and how in history its inhabitants had learnt to lean upon themselves during such predicaments.
