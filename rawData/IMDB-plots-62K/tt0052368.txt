Truck drivers take cargo of explosives over bumpy mountain road.
The Cyclone Rocket Company is a military contractor building missiles for the U.S. Air Force. The company also produces the highly volatile rocket fuel used in the missiles. During a test, a missile explodes. For safety reasons, the government decides to move the company from its current location, nearby an army base and small town, to a new remote location. However, the plant's dangerous chemicals must be moved by truck to the new location via secondary unpaved roads bypassing all inhabited areas, towns and communities. Moreover, the move must be completed fast and the plant must be operational in three days, in order to maintain its government contract. Three trucks are selected to transport the dangerous rocket fuels. Short on drivers for such a dangerous assignment, the company hires a motley crew of desperate men to drive the trucks through rough terrain to the new location. Each truck has a driver and a helper. Each man is promised five thousand dollars as payment upon successful delivery of the trucks and cargo. The six men are: recently unemployed maverick trucker Mitch Barton, company representative and fuel developer scientist George Lawrence, retired Marine sergeant Frank Miller, amiable drunk Pat Farley, compulsive gambler Ben and expert mechanic Joe. On the day of departure, a drunken Pat is replaced by his younger brother Ken who is a hot-rod race car driver. After the departure, each man explains his motivation for taking the job and what he will do with his pay. As expected, the three-truck convoy runs into trouble.
