In Prospect Bay, a remote outpost on the South Australian coast, two communities, the Goonyas and the Nungas, come together on the one field they have in common, the football field. But the underlying racism and class warfare threatens to make the team's greatest victories irrelevant. This holds particularly true for Blacky, a white teen who is more interested in books than sport, and his best friend, Dumby, the Aboriginal star of the team.
In an isolated South Australian fishing town, the only thing that connects two communities the whites and the blacks is football. Gary Black (Nathan Phillips) and Dumby Red (Luke Carroll) are an exception teenage best friends from different sides of the tracks. Dumby is the star of the football team and likely to become the next big Aboriginal star in the big leagues. Gary is the bookish son of a hard-drinking and brutal white fisherman, Bob Black (Simon Westaway). He is attracted to Dumbys beautiful sister, Clarence (Lisa Flanagan). When their team wins the premiership, Dumbys elation is short-lived. He is passed over for the Best-on-ground prize, setting off a chain of events that ends in tragedy.
