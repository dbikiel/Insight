To flee from an arranged marriage, a free-spirited Corfiot disguises herself as a gawky lad and abandons a life of riches to seek freedom. An honest fellow traveller becomes her guardian angel; however, will he ever find out her secret?
Katsaros, Rena's rich father insists in marrying her with Dinos, son of a ship owner. Rena escapes, dresses as a boy and introduces herself as Pipis. Pipis meets Lefteris who helps him. Lefteris finds out Pipis' secret and falls in love with "him". However, Rena thinks that Lefteris helps her so as to get a reward from her father. So, she returns to her house and agrees to marry with Dinos, only to get persuaded at the last minute for Lefteris' true love.
To flee from a hopeless arranged marriage with the frivolous son of an affluent shipowner, the beautiful and free-spirited Corfiot, Rena Katsarou, summons up the courage to abandon both her family and a pampered life of riches. On the road with nothing more than a ragged outfit and a short-haired periwig, a desperate feminine Rena boldly becomes the gawky and cheerful lad, Pipis, intent on crossing the Ionian Sea to find freedom. However, as fate would have it, Lefteris--an honest fellow traveller and a recently fired young man--becomes Pipis' guardian angel, utterly unaware, though, of Rena's elaborate disguise. Will he ever find out Rena's secret? In the end, can there be a future between a lady and a tramp?
