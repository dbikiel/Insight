In the closing days of WWII remnants of the Japanese army in Leyte are abandoned by their command and face certain starvation.
It is the Philipines, 1945. The Japanese Imperial Army has been reduced to a ragtag mob hiding in the jungles. Among them is Pvt. Tamura. The situation goes from bad to worse and in the face of the brutal conditions facing the men, some go insane and resort to murder and cannibalism. In the midst of this, Pvt. Tamura tries to survive without giving up his principles.
In February, 1945, during last days of the Battle of Leyte, elements of the Imperial Japanese army have been abandoned by their leaders and deprived of food and supplies. Command and control has disintegrated, leaving individuals and small groups to their own devices in order to survive the rapidly deteriorating situation. Shuttled between his unit and a field hospital, a tubercular Private Tamura is forced to strike out on his own, hoping to avoid starvation and the tightening siege by American forces. Seeing his fellow soldiers slaughtered while trying to escape or surrender, the increasingly desperate Tamura bonds with Yasuda and Nagamatsu, two opportunists who barter tobacco for food and other provisions. While they live on "monkey meat," Tamura is confronted with the price he must pay in order to survive.
