A gangster (Robert Sterling) hides out on a farm and falls for the farmer's daughter (Marsha Hunt).
A remake of Robert Montgomery's 1934 hit Hide-Out, this superb film directed by Robert B. Sinclair (known for his classic Broadway productions of The Philadelphia Story, Dodsworth and Pride and Prejudice) creates a mesmerizing dance between innocence and a life gone wrong.
