Alex and Elliot an unlikely pair connect to write a film about a New York cop working undercover as a fashion model.
Alex Andero feels stuck washing dishes in his family's trattoria in New York City. He wants to write screenplays, and he has a great idea. Trouble is, he's not much with a typewriter; so, when his cousin calls and says a producer likes the idea and wants a script, Alex swallows his homophobia and asks for help from Elliot Springer, a talented writer who's an insecure, gay, Jewish nebbish. Elliot doesn't want the job, but Alex sets him up with Joey, a good-looking actor who works in the cafe. Elliot and Joey are soon getting it on, the script is slowly emerging, and Alex is discovering the beauty of Gwen, a woman in his writing class. Then, ego and greed threaten the partnership.
