As a tunnel construction project threatens the natural order of one of Japan's last untouched regions, an old man and his granddaughter Haruna's humble lifestyle begins to influence the outlook of a man from Tokyo.
A visual poem that captures the undulating peaks and ravines of the remote Iya region in Tokushima Prefecture. Shot on 35mm film, it depicts the daily lives of an elderly mountain man and his granddaughter, and conveys the nobility of living in harmony with nature. Way up in the mountains of Iya, Grandpa and Haruna adhere to a solitary, self-sufficient lifestyle without electricity or gas. Then Kudo, a young man from the city with a romantic view of country life, moves into the village at the foot of their mountain.
