After two-month of separation, Emmanuelle must find her husband, Jean in Hong-Kong. She goes there by boat. Once in Thailand, she finds her husband and meets Christopher, a mysterious airplane pilot. At a dinner, she also meets Laura, Jean's mistress and her troubling stepdaughter Anna Maria. She proceeds to have several extramarital affairs -- with Jean's knowledge, of course.
