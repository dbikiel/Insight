8 people, 22 diseases, 28 days on juice... could the results of this four-week "juice-only" experiment show that the answer to treating most chronic disease may be cheaper and simpler than we think?
The world is facing a pandemic of chronic disease heart disease, diabetes, cancer, obesity, asthma, kidney and liver disease, Alzheimers, autoimmune diseases, allergies and skin conditions and many, many more. This year more than 36 million people will die from degenerative conditions more than from all other causes put together, and that number is expected to rise to over 50 million within 15 years. At the same time, the amount spent trying to treat these diseases with pharmaceutical drugs is expected to rise by 50% to more than $1.2 trillion!
What if all of these diseases were actually caused by just one thing, and the remedy so cheap and easy to obtain that you could buy it with your weekly shopping? What if this remedy was so safe and effective that you didnt need to visit a doctor to get it prescribed; and in fact you might not need to take any other medication ever again? What if this remedy was so simple yet so revolutionary that it could destroy the foundations of two massive industries whose entire economic existence is based around keeping us unhealthy and addicted to their products?
One summer Jason Vale took eight people who collectively suffered from 22 different chronic diseases and put them on his Juice Only diet for 28 days. Could these different diseases with their many different prescribed drugs be improved and even cured by one thing? Maybe its time to get Super Juiced!
