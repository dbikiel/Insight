Filmed at the Gramercy Theatre in New York City, the hilarious and charming "Full Time Magic" is Nate Bargatze's first one-hour stand-up special. Despite being a married man with a young daughter, Nate is not immune to embarrassing situations. It's hard to imagine the laid-back Tennessee native has been met with the prospect of fighting his wife's ex-boyfriend on a boat, been at risk of snake bites in Honduras, and was almost caught in a brawl at a McDonald's.
