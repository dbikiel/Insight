As the world succumbs to a zombie apocalypse, Cole, a hardened mercenary, is chasing the one person who can provide a cure. In his way aren't only the flesh-eating, super-athletic cannibals as humanity's greatest danger, but people themselves!
London: The not too distant future. Newgen Industries, a leading pharmaceutical company company, is trying to placate a media uproar. Its new "legal performance enhancer", RAK-295, has met with spectacular failure during testing, causing severe physical and allergic reactions in all 30,000 of its test subjects.... Allergic reactions in all but one user... Angela Mills. Angela is pregnant and is making arrangements for own leave of absence from a city full of woe and bad memories for her. With Angela being the only person not to report any type of reaction to Newgen, Dr. Brooke (Head of Newgen) understands that Angela may hold the key to solving this disaster and enlists Cole, the head of security to find her and bring her in for examination. But Cole, a hardened ex-mercenary, has just handed in his resignation to Peter White, the CEO of the company. Why? He wants out - the undercover violent and murderous job of solving problems 'off the record' has started to weigh heavy on his conscience. The outbreak claims Brooke and Peter White and during the struggle Cole is bitten - his fate sealed. Or is it?... (taken from Intandem Films)
