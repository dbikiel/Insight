A group of humans arrive on Sirius 6-B to investigate an SOS signal sent out from the planet, which has been supposedly deserted since the destruction of the man-made weapons known as "screamers." Once the squad arrives, they find a group of human survivors eking out an existence in an old military outpost, but more important, they discover that the threat of the screamers has become even more insidious, now that they're able to morph into human form.
After two months in cryogenic sleep, a rescue mission composed of seven crew members arrive in Sirius 6B to investigate an SOS distress signal sent from the planet. Sirius 6B was assumed uninhabited after the annihilation of humans by the weapons screamers created by the scientist Orsow. On the arrival, the team led by Captain Andy Sexton is informed that in seven days, the planet will be blown by a severe storm that will destroy any survivor and they need to leave the planet before the event. Soon they meet humans in a military outpost that battle against them and the team spends the night in a facility. They find hundreds of deactivated screamers and during the night, Sexton sneaks out and charges one screamer to download its hard disk with all the information about the lethal weapon. On the next morning, they return to their spaceship Medusa and learn that s screamer has killed the watcher Soderquist and stolen the battery cells. Now they must contact the hostile survivors the get any battery cell that might be available in the planet. When they succeed in contacting the survivors, they learn that the screamers have evolved to a state-of-art generation with human form.
