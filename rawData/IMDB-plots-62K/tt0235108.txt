Two scriptwriter friends with clashing personalities decide to write a contemporary political film. The difficulties are enormous. Traps abound. They stray from the plot, argue and make up, with their lives constantly intertwined with the exemplary story of the "Moliterno &amp; co." Garage. Gigi and Jean Do repair cars. Lola then polishes them while Marthe makes out the bills. Grandpa teaches the baby Italian revolutionary songs while Vanessa and Mouloud sell flowers and sea urchins at the market. The entire family works their fingers to the bone, twelve hours a day, seven days a week to get by in this time of high unemployment. But then, globalization sails onto the horizon and a multinational threatens to rock this "raft of the Meduse". Our heroes take up arms. With the support of the entire population, they triumph, as befits a tale set in Estaque.
