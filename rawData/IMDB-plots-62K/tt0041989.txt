In the 1890s, Trottie True moves from bit theatre parts to stardom, and from balloonist Sid Skinner to more prominent men. Later on, she wonders if Sid wasn't better after all, and seeks to find out.
Tottie True is a gay-90s British music-hall performer who has her sights set on moving from rags to riches, who loses her heart to the pure-and-true blue balloonist, Sid Skinner, but continues her upward search on improving her social status. She finally settles for Lord Landon Digby who has lots of assets and a very stiff upper lip. She gets a lot of the latter and very little of the former, and decides Sid might have been a better choice.
