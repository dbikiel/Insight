The events that led to the 1965 race riots in Watts, Los Angeles, are covered by a black messenger-turned-reporter at the L.A. Times, as he was one of the first correspondents to arrive at the scene. The movie also follows the troubled times he, his family and friends went through in one of the most tense and sad moments in American history.
