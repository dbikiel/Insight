Jochen Falk and two further former Stasi agents embark on a dangerous mission to rescue the kidnapped president of Katschekistan. But soon it becomes clear that Falk pursues his own objectives.
Germany 2015. The Wall is more than 25 years down, when the once legendary GDR-Spy Jochen Falk (H. Huebchen) found himself called back on duty by the former enemy, the BND. The case: rescue the interim president and hope-springing canditate for the peaceful future of the republic of Katchekistan, who was kidnapped by separatists along with Berlin's official man on the ground, Franz Kern (J. Prochnow). The BND needs Falk's old contacts to get him back. Falk is not at all surprised by the helpless approach of the BND and names his conditio sine non qua: bringing back his old team. For the BND a tough and unwelcome call. What the BND doesn't know: Falk and Kern are heartful competetors from those days, and Falk is aiming for payback-time.
