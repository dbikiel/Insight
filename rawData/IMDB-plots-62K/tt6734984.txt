Trained by a high profile cop, an encounter specialist masquerading as a Brahmin priest takes on a real estate crime organization after losing his uncle.
A man from an orthodox, protective family is also a secret vigilante who directly kills culprits with the help of a cop as he doesn't believe in prolonged justice system. When his own uncle dies due to land mafia, he sets out to provide justice to all other victims and confronts the real culprit.
