Franco and Ciccio are two simple-minded Italian guys whom are mistaken by KGB spies by government agents from their government and other foreign governments.
Acting on bogus information so internationally ridiculous that only imbeciles would fall for, burglars Franco and Ciccio break into a mansion in Rome to rob it only having proved their are stupid enough to make ideal decoys for an espionage sting. They are drugged by an American spy boss, named Fred, on the orders of an espionage computer, and microfilm containing bogus military information is inserted into one of Franco's molar teeth. The two dim-wits are then revived and sent on a "holiday" to the French Riviera where the plan is for the two decoys to be seized by either the Russians or the Chinese, both of them willing to hunt down the real military secrets. However, through a series of comic adventures, the two Italian idiots elude their intended captors and head to the beach. For the Americans, it transpires that instead of phony information a genuine secret formula has been accidentally implanted. Soon, the spies of all the major superpowers are hunting the duo down, determined to pull out all of Franco's teeth.
