Gang of robbers use dune buggies for their big heist.
In need of some luck, lovers and struggling con artists, Flash and Firecat, plan to steal $50,000 from a small-town bank, despite Flash's reservations about her partner's latest scheme. As Flash kidnaps Tracy Walley, the bank manager's teenage son, Firecat informs Mr. Walley about the abduction, then escapes with all the money in the bank. After leaving Tracy in a location several miles out of town, the couple picks up supplies to make a getaway across the desert in their customized dune buggies. Although blundering Sheriff C.W. Thurston is unable to capture the duo, a determined insurance agent, Milo Pewett, follows their trail.
