The tragic love of the Jewish girl and the Nazi officer is presented as a symbol of human purity defeated by fascism and racial prejudice.
Stationed in a remote and quiet Bulgarian village in 1943, the sensitive artist and Wehrmacht officer, Walter, finds himself pleasingly away from the horrors of the battlefield. With his brigade channelling entire populations of captured Greek-Jews to the hellish concentration camp, Auschwitz, Walter will see his world turn upside down when the young Grecian prisoner, Ruth, summons up the courage and turns to him for a pregnant woman. Against the backdrop of a dangerously volatile situation, little by little, conflicting emotions take over the unlikely couple, as, more and more, Walter falls for Ruth. Can there be a future for the doomed lovers?
A detachment of Nazi soldiers escorting Greek Jews to the Auschwitz death camp stops at a small Bulgarian town in 1943. Walter, the non-commissioned officer from the Nazi army, a skeptical and disillusioned intellectual, falls most unexpectedly (even for himself) in love with the Jewish girl Ruth. This new feeling gradually makes him stop and reflect on the events taking place around him and comes face to face with the inhuman nature of fascism. He is tortured by anxious thought about the part he is called to play in the eternal struggle between evil and good. Helped by Bulgarian resistance fighters, Walter organizes Ruth's escape. When the time arrives he realizes that he has been deceived about the exact departure hour of the prisoners.
