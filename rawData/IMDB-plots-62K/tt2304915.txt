The son of a founding leader in the Palestinian organization, Hamas, becomes a spy for the Israelis.
A Palestinian in Ramallah, Mosab Hassan Yousef grows up angry and ready to fight Israel. Arrested for smuggling guns at the age of 17, he's interrogated by the Shin Bet, Israel's security service, and sent to prison. But shocked by Hamas's ruthless tactics in the prison and the organization's escalating campaign of suicide bombings outside, Mosab agrees to spy for Israel. For him, there is no greater shame. For his Shin Bet handler, Gonen, there is no greater prize: "operating" the oldest son of a founding member of Hamas.
Based on the New York Times Bestselling memoir SON OF HAMAS by Mosab Hassan Yousef, THE GREEN PRINCE is a unique cinematic experience: a story of loyalty and betrayal, of political intrigue and unthinkable choices, but above all it is a story of great hope. A feature-length documentary adaptation of the NYT Bestseller Son Of Hamas, produced by two times Oscar winning producer Simon Chinn (Searching For Sugar Man, Man On Wire) and Oscar winning producer John Battsek (One Day In September), directed by Israel Film Academy Award winner Nadav Schirman (The Champagne Spy), The Green Prince is proof that often fact is greater than fiction.
