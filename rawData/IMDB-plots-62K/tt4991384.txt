Four labourers are tortured by the police to confess to a theft they have not committed.
Four immigrants (Pandi, Murugan, Afsal and Kumar) are detained by the local state police, tortured and forced to admit to a crime they have no knowledge of. When all hope seems to be lost, a policeman from their hometown speaks on their behalf at the court hearing, setting them free. The policeman asks for a return favor and the boys oblige, oblivious to the consequences that await them. As they unwittingly bear witness to a political treason, the system seeks to silence them at any cost. But Pandi is determined to be heard.
Hailing from TamilNadu, Pandi and three of his friends work in a provision store in the neighboring state of Andhra Pradhesh amidst a daily struggle without knowing the Telugu language. They stay in a park unable to afford accommodation elsewhere. Pandi is also smitten by Shanthi who works as a helper in a house near to the shop and reaches out to him to save her from an abusive employer. Little could they have known that their nomadic life would set them on a course of no return as they fall victim to the system that exploits their weaknesses.
