In 19th century France, a peasant winemaker endeavors to create the perfect vintage.
!800s, Napoleonic era. Sobran Jodeau (Jérémie Renier) is an ambitious young peasant winemaker. He has three loves of his life - his beautiful wife Celeste (Keisha Castle-Hughes), the proudly intellectual baroness Aurora de Valday (Vera Farmiga) and Xas (Gaspard Ulliel), a male angel who strikes up one day each year but enduring friendship that borders on eroticism with him. Under Xas' guidance, Sobran is forced to fathom the nature of love and belief and in the process grapples with the sensual, the sacred and the profane - in pursuit of the perfect vintage.
