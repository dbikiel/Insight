An alien narrates the story of his dying planet, his and his people's visits to Earth and Earth's man-made demise, while human astronauts attempt to find an alternate planet for surviving humans to live on.
DVD product description:From legendary filmmaker Werner Herzog (Grizzly Man, Fitzcarraldo, Nosferatu) comes an inspired vision: as humans search for a new planet to colonize, aliens attempt to settle on the nearly-uninhabitable Earth. Oscar-nominee Brad Dourif (Deadwood, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, Seed of Chucky) delivers a remarkable performance as he tells the aliens' story. Herzog has combined original NASA footage with Henry Kieser's incredible documentary images from beneath the Antarctic Ocean, as well as interviews with respected scientists, that culminate in his personal plea to save our planet.
