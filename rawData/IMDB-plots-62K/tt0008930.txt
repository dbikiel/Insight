A small-town girl goes to New York hoping to become a star on Broadway, but the best she can do are roles as chorus girls. She falls in with a "fast" crowd, notably a "party girl" named Cherry Blow, and finds herself involved with wild parties, horny millionaires and her boyfriend from back home who has come to New York to marry her.
