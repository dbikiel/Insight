The Second World War is over, and the Miniver family is trying to keep themselves together in post-War Britain, among continuing shortages and growing tensions within the family.
Like everyone in England, Mrs. Miniver celebrates VE day. Soon the entire Miniver clan is reunited with Clem returning from service in Europe, Judy from Cairo and young Toby from a stay in the United States. Clem resumes work as an architect but has his eyes set on migrating to Brazil where the government wants qualified architects for a massive building program. Toby has a acquired a number of Americanisms during his stay there. While serving in Cairo, Judy fell in love with the married Steve Brunswick while Tom Foley, the grocer's son, fell in love with her. Mrs. Miniver has the biggest secret of all however - she is terminally ill. She endeavors to make the best of her time ensuring her family will be as happy as can be after she's gone.
