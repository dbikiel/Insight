A group of young urban workaholics sign up for a weekend of paintballing to have some adventure. But the adrenaline-filled entertainment soon turns into a manhunt, in which they become the prey and the hunter shoots live ammo not paint. It is no longer a game!
A truck rumbles down a potholed track. In the back sit a group of passengers, their eyes blindfolded. They don't know each other, but they have a lot in common: they're young, urban workaholics, with an appetite for extreme experiences. They've signed up for a weekend of adventure. As they head out into the unknown, they hear the others breathing in the darkness, steadying their pulses in silence as the adrenaline begins to flow The blindfolds come off to reveal in a dense forest. Each player is equipped with supplies to last the weekend, a powerful paintball gun, ammunition, maps and instructions. They have to complete an adventure trail that takes in ravines, caves and obstacle-ridden trekking paths. The group is split into two teams. The winners will be the team that wipes out their opponents and completes the circuit. They wanted adventure? They got it. Deep in the woods, one group is ambushed. Invisible snipers pin them down in a hail of paint then one of their number collapses, writhing in agony. Red blood mixes with the paint. Confusion reigns. Who is shooting at them? In the silence, they stare round at each other, and into the forest, looking for a traitor or some kind of explanation. The rules of the game have changed. The only law is the law of the jungle, and nobody trusts anybody else. Hidden among the trees, camouflaged by leaves and branches, there are deadly traps. Hunted down like prey in a lethal game, the teams face a desperate struggle for survival. There's nothing like a brush with death to make you feel alive.
