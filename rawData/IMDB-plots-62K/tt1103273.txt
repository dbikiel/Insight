Four siblings implode after the release of a book written about them.
On the day of their Father's 70th birthday party, four siblings come to terms with the publication of a novel written by the youngest sibling, that exposes the family's most intimate secrets.
Nathan has just written a best-selling book that exposes all his family's dirty little secrets. His sister Cheri is suing him since she says it's all lies. Brother Joel is struggling to get his life back on track after a third trip to rehab. Brother Jack's responsible demeanor is crumbling as he has to admit his secrets to his wife. Meanwhile, Nathan has to keep his own secrets under-wraps as he tries to act condescendingly towards the hot, young PR rep he hired. Even worse, today they all have to gather to celebrate their father's birthday.
