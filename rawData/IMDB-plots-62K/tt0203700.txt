"Mammy is washing her little pickaninny. She thrusts him, kicking and struggling, into a tub full of foaming suds." - from the Edison Catalog
Against a plain backdrop, a mother holds her infant, probably six or eight months old, over a washtub of sudsy water. She holds him in one hand and has a cup in the other, which she fills from the tub and pours over the child. He struggles and fusses; she smiles and looks from him to someone off camera. She wears a patterned high-collar long-sleeve dress and a white apron.
