A young man steals a smuggler's goods and tries to sell them in a trip with his beloved girl to the Iranian borders.
When a young man Majid gets beaten up and stabbed, his friend Masoud takes to the road with a truck of stolen fireworks. Fleeing customs and his employers, he heads for the border with the woman he loves in a show of defiance and a bid for self-determination. Wrapped in colourful layers of amusing and entertaining stories of thieves, smugglers, lovers, lemon castles and high voltage, 'Hard Makeup' is a stunning piece of arthouse cinema, brutal, honest and affecting.
