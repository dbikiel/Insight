Three guys in their twenties love wine and women but they are still virgins. Under the guise of a wine tour they embark on a journey to Spain hoping to have their first sexual experience. Jozef is blind, Philip is paralyzed from the neck down and Lars is in a wheelchair with a brain tumor, but they're not going to let anything stand in their way...
Wheelchair-bound Lars and Philip and their blind mate Jozef, all in their twenties, desperately long for a coming of age journey and the end of virginity. Finally they can convince their parents to let them drive trough France to Spain in a specially equipped minibus, chaperoned by experienced nurse Theo, omitting their Spanish destination is near an accommodating brothel. Lars gets a diagnosis spelling early death and Theo cancels, but Lars convinces his mates to go anyway, the bus being driven by Theo's francophone friend, obese Claude. Nothing goes to plan, yet satisfaction is found until the bitter end.
