The official trailer for TOO YOUNG TO DIE!, a supernatural comedy about an unlucky high school student who dies in a bus crash during a school trip only to be press-ganged into a demonic rock band in Hell, is now available online. The trailer details the plight of Daisuke (played by Ryunosuke Kamiki), who wants to confess his crush to his would-be girlfriend Hiromi (Aoi Morikawa), only to die unexpectedly and find himself in Hell. There Daisuke encounters the flamboyant Killer K (Tomoya Nagase), the lead guitar and vocalist of the infernal rock band known as Hells, and together they embark on a hard-rocking tour of the Afterlife in an attempt to get Daisuke back to the Land of the Living and the girl he loves.
