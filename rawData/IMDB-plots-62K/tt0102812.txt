A compassionate young nurse is determined to help an elderly invalid strapped to a revolutionary health care bed but there are unexpected consequences.
An old man is being treated specially by the Department of Health under the so-called Project Z, a special nursing bed with a 6th generation computer on board. When the pain and loneliness of the old man reaches his ex-private nurse, she decides to rescue him from the government's experiment. Thus begins a wild chase through the busy streets of Tokyo as the 6th generation computer begins to have the personality of the old man's ex-wife and as the government's secret project unfolds.
ROUJIN Z is a classic feature length anime by director Katsuhiro Otomo the creator of AKIRA. Unlike AKIRA, ROUJIN Z is an comedy.
An experimental computerized sick bed malfunctions and goes on a rampage through Tokyo with an invalid old man aboard. (Roujin means old man in Japanese.) The out of cotrol atomic powered bed adds other machines to itself and grows to gigantic proportions. (much like Tetsuo's out of control body in AKIRA.) There's plenty of action and laughs with teens in trouble, bumbling bureaucrats and giant fighting robots.
The 1998 DVD contains the original version subtitled, and a dubbed English version. Even if you don't like English dubs, watch this one for the extra jokes the scripter added to the film.
