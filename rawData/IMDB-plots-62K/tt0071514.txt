A housewife tries to finance her cab-driving husband's education.
Henrietta Robins works out of her home and her husband Pete drives a cab to try to support her. When Pete gets a tip from one of his fellow drivers that a deal will be made by the Americans and the Soviets over pork bellies, he decides to invest in the market, but needs to $3000 to invest. Henrietta then goes to extreme lengths to get the money by dealing with first a loan shark, then a madame, then the mob and finally cattle rustlers. All this in the name of love.
Young married Brooklynites Pete and Henry Robbins are madly in love with each other, despite their financial problems. Pete works as a cab driver, while Henry, the household money manager, does whatever odd part-time jobs she can, such as telephone sales. Pete learns through his dispatcher about a sure-fired investment in the commodity's market, specifically in pork belly futures, that will pay out huge dividends within a week. They need a minimum $3,000 to be able to invest, which is $2,700.38 more than they have. After trying through legal means, Henry, who would do anything for her husband, decides to borrow the money from a loan shark. Henry doesn't see the 20% weekly interest rate as a problem because the investment should pay off far more than that. Henry lies to Pete about the source of the money. Problems ensue for Henry when the investment doesn't pay off as quickly as Pete thought. So when the loan shark doesn't get his money back on time, he is after Henry unless he can "sell" Henry's contract. Even if the loan shark can sell the contract, will Henry be able to pay off the buyer any easier? And what will Pete do if he finds out either the source of the money and/or that Henry lied to him?
