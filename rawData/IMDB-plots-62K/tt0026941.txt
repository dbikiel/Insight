Ambrose the kitten renames himself Butch and runs away from home with plans to become a robber. His first intended victim, though, is a real robber: Dirty Bill, a dog. Dirty Bill asks Ambrose/Butch if he's pulled off any big jobs, and he tells of the stagecoach robbery we saw him enacting with dolls and toys at the beginning of the movie, without, of course, mentioning that it was all playacting. Bill asks him about the loot, and Butch brings out a bag of cookies. Bill won't accept that answer, and comes after Ambrose, scaring him right into the bath he earlier avoided.
