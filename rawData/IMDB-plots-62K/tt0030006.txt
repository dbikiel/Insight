Disbanded Texas Rangers are gathered together to help the U.S. Cavalry put an end to marauding outlaws.
When the Texas rangers are disbanded, outlaws move in. Ex-Ranger Roy joins the Cavalry but deserts when the Calvalry is unable to stop the outlaws and his brother is killed. Ex-Senator Harvey has organized the State Patrol and Roy soon learns it's a protection racket with those not joining burned out or murdered.
