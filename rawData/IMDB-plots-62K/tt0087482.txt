Alternating between the past and the present, a precocious little girl sues her selfish, career-driven parents for emancipation, surprising them both.
Albert and Lucy fall in love, get married, and have a daughter Casey. Everything is wonderful, until their work distracts Albert and Lucy from each other and Casey. They soon divorce and start fighting. Casey, who spends much time with their Latino maid and childminder, eventually decides to seek legal emancipation from her parents, and to go and live full time with the maid who has been taking care of her. The media pick up the case and have a field day with it, making things worse.
