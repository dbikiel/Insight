The World War II adventures of a British convoy escort ship and its officers.
At the start of World War II, Cmdr. Ericson is assigned to convoy escort HMS Compass Rose with inexperienced officers and men just out of training. The winter seas make life miserable enough, but the men must also harden themselves to rescuing survivors of U-Boat attacks, while seldom able to strike back. Traumatic events afloat and ashore create a warm bond between the skipper and his first officer. Atmospheric sea footage.
Lt Commander Ericson is the commander of HMS Compass Rose, a Royal Navy corvette. It is January 1940 and Compass Rose has the task of escorting merchant ships across the Atlantic. The main threat comes from German U-boats but initially these are few and their attacks uncoordinated. Over time, however, the U-Boats gain the upper hand and life on an allied ship is one of constant danger. Ericson and his crew endure everything the Germans have to throw at them but the ultimate enemy appears to be the sea, the cruel sea.
