After being kicked out of her London apartment, Polish immigrant Katia finds a new roommate in Lucy. The two bond and quickly become friends. One day, Lucy takes her to visit a local tattoo artist named Bob. Upon meeting Katia, he comments on her perfect skin, which is unmarked by tattoos and piercings. Unbeknownst to the girls, his life isn't as happy as his calm demeanor would make it seem. After being diagnosed with early-onset Parkinson's, a disease that will end his career, his marriage became strained and eventually fell apart. With the clock ticking, he has become obsessed with creating one final masterpiece before his body gives in to the disease. When Lucy is called back home to care for her ailing mother, he takes advantage of Katia's solitude and kidnaps her, locking her in a jail cell under his tattoo shop. She is then subjected to his obsession as he goes to work on her blank canvas of a body.
