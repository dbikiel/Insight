A woman is stalked and eventually kidnapped by her psychotic ex-husband. Her present husband, who wasn't even aware that his wife had been previously married, is initially caught in a scheme that gets him accused of murder. Then when he tries to convince the police that his wife is in trouble, no one believes him. This forces him to take the law into his own hands to rescue his wife. David Keith appears as an ex-con who initially convinces the couple that he is a parole officer searching for the ex-husband, but is in fact a co-conspirator.
