With their university graduation nearing, a group of young students grapple with the inevitable fact that they must now become young 'adults'.
Mike is an average twenty-one year old university student. He goes to class, shares an apartment with his two best friends, and he has no luck with women. That is until Mike meets Sam. The two students share a common feeling of disillusionment with the way their lives are progressing and they begin to fall for each other. Their budding romance is the centrepiece of the film and it is through them that we meet the rest of the romantically challenged ensemble.
