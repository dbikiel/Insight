The young Countess Ileana arrives in the rich family mansion with her friends: mostly hippies and students belonging to subversive movements. The rich mansion is inhabited by Ileana's father, tetraplegic and now unable to communicate following a severe paralysis and the girl's younger brother, mentally alienated devoted to embalming animals. Berta, the housekeeper, another domestic and the family doctor also reside in the house. Some of the boys invited by Ileana are inexplicably killed. The killer kills the victims by removing their eyeballs. All this leads us to believe that the murderer is Ileana's brother. In reality, the murderer is Berta, the housekeeper. With the complicity of the doctor and the butler she had planned everything to be the sole heir of the count's fortune. When she realizes that the doctor and the butler are not willing to cover up her murders, he loses her head and kills them too, being discovered by the police commissioner.
