Cool Cat thought he had the perfect life. But then he met Butch. Butch, a convicted murder who had spent six years in a mental institution but had somehow escaped, brought an end to the serenity of Cool Cat's blissful suburban neighborhood, striking fear into the hearts of the local children. Unbeknownst to Butch, his criminal acts have finally caught up with him. With demands for the U.S. to extradite the Bully to Germany, Cool Cat has to come to terms with the mistakes of his past.
Cool Cat Teached Kids about safety, dealing with bullies and having fun with others.
