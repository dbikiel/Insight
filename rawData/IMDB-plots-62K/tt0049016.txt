While doing a good deed, the title hero has to shoot a man in self defense, and go into hiding. His peace is interrupted when a cattle baron rides into his territory, and decides to settle there. When no locals want to sell, Jared Tetlow turns to murdering the locals with his hired gun Dee Havalik, and starting a range war. Blackjack finds he has to kill the Tetlow gang off one by one, to restore peace in this movie sharing nothing in common with its real-name historical outlaw.
