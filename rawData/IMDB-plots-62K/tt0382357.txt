A drama that investigates anxiety and disillusionment in America.
The American daughter of missionaries Lana returns to Los Angeles from Palestine to work in a mission helping homeless people. Lana was born in Ohio and raised in South Africa and Middle East, and she is an authentic citizen of the world, connected through Internet and aware of how other people see the lack of culture and knowledge and exaggerated patriotism of average American people. Her unique relative is her unknown uncle Paul, a veteran of Vietnam War that cut relationships with his family and is bigot and paranoid. Paul lives in a surveillance van, lives as if he were a secret agent, sees conspiracy and terrorist cells everywhere, and has a great prejudice against Arabs and other non-American breeds after the September, 11th. They meet each other, and when they see the murder of a poor Pakistanis nearby the mission, they travel together to the small town of Trone to deliver his corpse to the family, where Paul sees a different reality.
The Gospels, preached at a Skid-Row mission, contrast with images of LA's homeless, post-9/11 mistrust, and anti-Muslim violence. Lana cares about the poor - she's just come to LA from the West Bank, staying at a mission. She seeks her uncle Paul, a burned out Agent-Orange-addled Vietnam War vet, now a vigilante security cop, watching for terrorists two years after 9/11, suspicious of everything, including a Muslim carrying boxes of Borax. Lana and Paul drive to Death Valley, Lana to take the body of a murdered homeless Muslim to his brother, Paul to follow the Borax trail. Does family reconciliation resemble something larger?
