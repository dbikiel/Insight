A few years after their graduation from Princeton, Louis Baxter, who retired having sold his dot.com business, takes in college-buddy William, who desperately nears the end of his trust fund after several fully failed career-attempts. Louis takes William along to L.A.'s weirdest society event, the annual endangered animals benefit. This year, to raise more money she auctions a single dinner, which William bids his last capital on. He wins, according to Louis a shrewd business networking opportunity. But he's love-spelled by Ithaca, while she believes him to be the seeker, a long-awaited savior for the castle's most secret reality.
