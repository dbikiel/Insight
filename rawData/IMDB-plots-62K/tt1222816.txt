A documentary that delves into the realm of flowers and their pollinators.
WINGS OF LIFE launches into the stories of selected animal characters--a bat, a hummingbird, a butterfly, and a bee--stories that reveal the extraordinary importance of flowers and their pollinator partners. Though we primarily associate flowers with beauty, we often don't realize how essential they truly are--that without flowing plants and their winged messengers, and the foods they produce, we humans might not survive. Using special cinematic techniques, we explore the mystical intersection of the animal and plant worlds where life regenerates itself over and over again. It's this seductive dance that feeds the early, and today that dance is threatened.
