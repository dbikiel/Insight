What is going on here?!? French director, Michel Blanc (as Himself), just doesn't understand why his life is suddenly falling apart. This nightmarish comedy-thriller is all about identity. What defines a famous person? Is it their public self or their private self? What is the public's legitimate claim on their fame? With the glitterati of French Cinema starring as themselves, the anonymous faces in the audience gain a glimpse into the downside of public recognition.
In Cannes, the director and actor Michel Blanc is accused of sexual abuse by an actress and arrested. His friend Carole Bouquet decides to help him and they find his perfect double Patrick Olivier in the countryside of France. Patrick accepts minor jobs posing of Michel Blanc and when the farce is disclosed, he offers to replace Michel Clanc while he enjoys vacation. When Michel Blanc returns, he cannot prove who he is.
