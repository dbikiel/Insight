A man runs out the stage door of a burlesque theater, followed by billowing smoke. Firefighters run up. One places a ladder up to a second-story window beside the door, and he helps several women wearing burlesque costumes to climb down. On the other side of the door, a firefighter coaxes a woman out of a window. Two fire fighters enter the building and emerge soon after carrying a woman who has collapsed, overcome by smoke.
