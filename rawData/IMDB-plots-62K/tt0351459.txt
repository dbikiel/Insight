Five years before the events in the television series take place, Rui and Vani meet and fall in love on the day of their respective wedding ceremonies - to different people, in the same church.
The film shows the day when Rui and Vani first met. It was at their wedding (with other partners). Vani was going to marry Sérgio, and Rui would marry Marta in the same church, following Vani's marriage. While waiting for the ceremony, they begin to talk. Complications ensue.
Rui and Vani return to the church where they got married just the previous day to try to cancel their wedding with the priest. The problem is that they haven't married one with another! They tell the priest the whole story: Vani married Sérgio, and Rui married Marta. But problems begin in the first night of the new married couples, and confusion emerges when Vani discovers that Sérgio has had sex with another woman the night before the marriage and seeks shelter in Rui and Marta's apartment, just across the street.
