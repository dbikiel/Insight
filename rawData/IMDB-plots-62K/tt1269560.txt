This is a Christian film from Janette Oke's Love Comes Softly series. Belinda Simpson is recovering from the loss of her husband. She arrives in a small Missouri town to become the local doctor. The town doesn't immediately take to a female doctor. She's also faced with the challenge of an infection in the town, that everyone believes came from the local orphanage. With the help of her friend, Annie, and a young blacksmith, Lee Owens, Belinda seeks a cure.
Distraught and left doubtful of God by the death of her husband, Belinda Simpson takes a job in Missouri as a doctor. Upon her arrival, she and her companion, a friend from medical school, find the town prejudiced against the town orphanage where the disease seems to have stemmed from. Belinda, a former orphan herself, attempts to help the orphans and finds help from one particularly strong-willed girl. She also has to heal all the other sick people within the town and defend the orphanage and its residents from the scared townspeople and the ruthless Ray, all while trying to make some very important decisions about her life, a possible budding romance and her own faith.
