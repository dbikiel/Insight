A young man living in Los Angeles has been estranged from his wealthy New York family for years. One day, he suddenly receives word that his terminally ill father wishes to be taken off life support and has 36 hours to live. When he agrees to visit his father, he unintentionally sets up a family conflict with no easy resolution.
A terminally ill man decides to come off life support and just as he does so a lion escapes from the zoo and kills the President. The wave of news coverage is intercepted in space by a group of gay aliens who believe that the lion is the Supreme Leader of all Earth and they decide to visit to establish contact with the lion. Once they arrive they camp out in the hospital where the terminally ill man is and they cure him allowing him time to heal the wounds of his relationship with his estranged son, who left home years before because of a scandal involving fireworks and shop mannequin. Eventually father, son, aliens and the lion form a band and go on a tour of the mid west with hilarious results.
