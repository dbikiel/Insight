Dubious Bounty Killer Hank Fellows tracks bank stage coaches to observe them being robbed. Only afterwards does he move in on the bandits to collect his reward. The manager of the Omaha city bank persuades him to accept double the reward money on his last job if, this time, Fellows will prevent a threatened robbery taking place at all.
