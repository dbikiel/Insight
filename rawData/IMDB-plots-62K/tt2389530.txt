Filmmaker David Sieveking portays the home care of his mother who, like 2 million other people in Germany, suffers from Alzheimer's Disease. David's parents had been a part of the student movement in the sixties and led an open relationship, which is now put to the test dramatically by the disease. The whole family has to deal with the smoldering conflicts to find a new solidarity.
