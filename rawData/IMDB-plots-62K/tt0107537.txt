Ana bolts from her wedding altar and flies from Venezuela to Paris (in her wedding gown) to realize her dream of becoming a great opera star. The great Parisian director Italo Medici is filming an operatic Cinderella, but will Ana "fit into the glass slipper" before she is deported back to Caracas? The evil, plotting, self-absorbed Celeste tries to thwart Ana, but Ana has a great team in her corner: her Russian voice coach, a wealthy lesbian psychoanalyst, a prescient gay waiter/astrologer, and a voodoo witch doctor. Fun and adventurous.
