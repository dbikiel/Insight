A brutal dictator comes face to face with the injustices committed by his regime when his country is taken over by revolutionists.
The President is the story of a dictator of an imaginary country in the Caucasus, who is forced to escape following a coup d'Ã©tat, and begins a journey to discover his country in the company of his five-year-old grandson. The two travel across the lands that the President once governed. Now, disguised as a street musician to avoid being recognized, the former dictator comes into contact with his people, which he comes to know from a different point of view.
