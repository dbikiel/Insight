To gain entry to Heaven, a ghost attempts to reunite a divorcing couple as a good deed.
Mrs. Topper's friend Mrs. Parkhurst has convinced Mrs. Topper to file for a divorce from Cosmo, due to the strange circumstances of his trip with ghost Marion Kirby. Marion comes back from heaven's door to help Cosmo again, this time only with dog Mr. Atlas. Due to the strange behavior of Cosmo, the judge refuses to divorce them, so Mrs. Parkhurst takes Mrs. Topper on a trip to France, where she tries to arrange the final reasons for the divorce, with the help of a gold-digging French baron. Marion takes Cosmo to the same hotel, to bring them back together and to get her own final ticket to heaven, but the whole thing turns out to be not so easy...
