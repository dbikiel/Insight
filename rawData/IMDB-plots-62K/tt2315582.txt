A woman confronts an older man, her former neighbour, to find out why he abandoned her after they had a sexual relationship.
When a young woman unexpectedly arrives at her much-older former lover's workplace, looking for answers, the secrets of their dark past threaten to unravel his new life. What follows is an emotional and unflinching excavation of inappropriate love, with shattering consequences.
Tormented by a dark past, Una, a young woman in her late twenties who lives with her mother, is trapped in a dead-end job, desperately seeking a way out in ephemeral liaisons with strangers at nightclubs. Under those circumstances, an old photo of a man who used to be close to her will impel Una to stop by at his workplace, without knowing, however, what to expect from her unannounced, and above all, unpleasant visit. In the end, should the past stay buried?
'Una', based on David Harrower's play 'Blackbird', follows a young womans journey to reclaim her past.
Fifteen years earlier, Una ran away with an older man, Ray, a crime for which he was arrested and imprisoned. When she comes across a photo of him in a trade magazine, Una tracks him down and turns up at his workplace. Her abrupt arrival threatens to destroy Rays new life and derail her stability.
Unspoken secrets and buried memories surface as Una and Ray sift through the wreckage of the past. Their confrontation raises unanswered questions and unresolved longings. It will shake them both to the core.
'Una' gazes into the heart of a devastating form of love and asks if redemption is possible.
