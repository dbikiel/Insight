A Los Angeles police chase sends a fame-obsessed man on a wild ride to save his girlfriend from a cybernetic terror.
After watching on the news that an out-of-control ice cream truck is being chased by the police around the upper LA area, killing people and wrecking havoc among the way, a group of teens hell-bent on capturing the next viral video set out to chase the van. Things go from bad to worse when the content inside the van is revealed to be several tapes with bizarre stories, including that of a deranged illusionist who, after obtaining a demon-powered cloak, sets out on a killing spree; a garage scientist that manages to build a machine and open the door to a parallel world, where he and his double find out that their worlds are dangerously different; and the story of teenage skaters who unleash hordes of demonic foes after desecrating a ritual site in Tijuana.
