Rio de Janeiro, August 2016. The Summer Olympics are in full swing. A few steps away from the Maracan√£ stadium, but far from the international attention, a hundred pauperized families live together in an abandoned building. Despite the misery, gang violence and militarization of the neighborhood, the residents survive with ingenuity and resilience. Ignored by the sensationalist reports, their dignified and generous words reveal a universe of concrete and light, where the reality of today fades behind the aspirations for tomorrow.
