A young lady who has grown up with her father being a radio DJ, becomes one herself. Falls in love and hosts a 'Romantically Speaking' show.
Relationship expert Ariel Cookson hosts a radio show where she uses her personal relationship experience to advise listeners. When her boyfriend, Jonathan, breaks up with her the night before her live show, Ariel is mortified to tell her audience. She confides in her best friend, Nathan, who promptly brings her comfort food and a hug at the live event. The curtain opens just in time to reveal their embrace, leaving everyone assuming he is Jonathan. Against her better judgment, Ariel asks Nathan to keep up the ruse as her show continues to gain attention and success. Playing the part of a happy couple causes the best friends to see each other in a new light. With career success within reach and lies taking a toll on her conscience, Ariel must find the courage to be honest, not just to her audience, but to herself about her feelings for Nathan.
