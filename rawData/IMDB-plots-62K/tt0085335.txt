Unpopular girl being bullied in her class.
A twelve years old girl Lena who has come to live with her grandfather in a small Russian town is being bullied by her classmates. She took the rap of being a class traitor because she was in love with the boy who had betrayed his classmates when they were bunking off and going to cinema instead of a literature lesson. The class is penalized for that, not being allowed to go to Moscow for fall holidays with the rest of the school. Lena is being ostracised, "boycotted" however not telling the truth, waiting that the boy himself would confess to be guilty. Their classmates call her "a scarecrow" ("" in Russian, the same as title of the movie) and "the traitor". They mock her as well as her grandfather who collects local paintings and wears a coat with patches. The boy still proves to be a coward, not telling the truth, and what's more, beginning to torture her as well as the others. The pressure escalates and Lena who has told her grandfather about whole case finally decides to solve the problem once and for all.
