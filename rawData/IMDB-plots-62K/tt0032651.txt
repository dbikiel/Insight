When millionaire Wall Street stockbroker Robert Cain is indicted by a grand jury for embezzlement, his spoiled collegiate athlete son, Bob Jr., feels humiliated and turns his back on his father. He finds, however, that surviving on his own is not as easy as he thought. After he is fired and shamed by an employer for turning his back on his name, Bob Jr. has a change of heart and implores his father's old friends, including the 'respectable" lawyer he set up in business, to help him gain release for his father. After they turn their backs on him, he turns to "Judge" Emmett Brennan, lawyer for notorious hoodlum Mickey Dwyer, to gain his father's released. He meets Dwyer and his club singer girlfriend Lucky and endears himself to both under the alias "Johnny Apollo," as he turns to a life of crime in order to raise the money he needs to free his father.
