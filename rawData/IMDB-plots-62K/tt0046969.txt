A man wrongly imprisoned for murder breaks out of jail. He wants to clear his name, but with the police pursuing him, he's forced to take a beautiful young woman, driving a fast sports car, hostage and slip into a cross-border sports car race to try to make it to Mexico before the police get him.
At a truck stop, innocent Frank Webster (John Ireland), convicted for murder recently, and escaped from jail is seeking a way south. When he takes Connie Adair (Dorothy Malone) hostage he realizes that she is driving her race car to a competition and he sees a way to get away from the police chasing him. Tough cookie Connie is in fear for her life initially but realizes that Frank is innocent of the murder he has been convicted of and because of his situation is forced to confront the world with violence. As they travel toward the border Connie attempts to convince Frank to give himself up and bring forth certain information that can clear him and during their trip the two fall in love. Once they arrive at the auto race, Connie and Frank reason that they can use the competition as a cover to escape but the authorities are closing in and the couple realizes that they are in a race of their lives.
