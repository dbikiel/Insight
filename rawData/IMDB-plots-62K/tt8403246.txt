OscarÂ®-winning filmmakers Deborah Oppenheimer and Mark Jonathan Harris (Into the Arms of Strangers: Stories of the Kindertransport) reunite for a revealing first-hand look at the foster care system as seen through the eyes of those who know it best. With extraordinary access to the inner workings of the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS), Oppenheimer and Harris go beyond the sensational headlines and stereotypes to take an unprecedented look at an often misunderstood world and upend some of the most enduring myths about foster care and those involved in the system.
