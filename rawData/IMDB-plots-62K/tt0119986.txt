Two school kids, who are best friends, are drinking on the side of a river. One friend bets the other that he can't swim across the river and "Reach The Rock". The friend takes the bet and drowns halfway towards the rock. The entire town blames the the kid for his friends death, he runs away, never to be seen again. He eventually comes back to his home town of Shermerville and goes crazy, and starts to trash the town (for example, breaking store-front windows, stealing a police car). He also meets up with his old high school girlfriend. The majority of the movie takes place in one night.
In the small town Shemerville, the vandal Robin breaks the front window of a store in the middle of the night and is arrested by Deputy Ernie. Sheriff Quinn locks Robin in a cell while Ernie wants to have sex with his mistress Donna in the police car along his shift. The inhabitants of Shemerville and Quinn blame Robin for the death of Quinn's nephew Danny. However Robin recalls the night when he was drinking with his friend Danny on the side of the river and Danny challenges him to cross the river. Danny does not accept to go but Danny decides to swim alone and drowns. Robin succeeds to steal the key of his cell and along the night, he sneaks out from the police station to break other windows of the same owner with a great alibi. Later Quinn discovers that Robin's true intention is to call the attention of his high-school girlfriend Lise for whom he is in love.
