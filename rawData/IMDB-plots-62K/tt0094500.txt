There, bored and restless, first Lucy and Edmund, and then all four of the kids make their way through an attic wardrobe in Narnia, a magical land of mythical creatures and talking animals. But Narnia is not perfect: it's always winter and never Christmas since the White Witch began her rule. And there are evil creatures as well as good, and a traitor in their midst. Only the return of Aslan can bring victory in the coming battle to win spring and freedom back to Narnia. 3x54min episodes.
