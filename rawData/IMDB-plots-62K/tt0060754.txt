Ex-lawman Jim Cole retires to Wyoming to farm his land, but a land-greedy neighbor, an ex-con turned bounty hunter, and a vicious grizzly bear upset his retirement plans.
Marshal "Big Jim" Cole turns in his badge and heads to Wyoming with his family in order to settle on some land left him by a relative. He faces opposition from a neighbor who wants that land for his own sons, and from a grizzly bear, nicknamed "Satan", who keeps killing Cole's livestock.
