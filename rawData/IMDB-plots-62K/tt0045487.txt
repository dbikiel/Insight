In 1944, at a POW camp in Germany the Allied prisoners use a dummy prop named Albert to fool the German guards and escape.
When several escapes at an German pow camp go wrong, the prisoners begin to think, that there is an informer revealing their plans to the enemy. Then Lt Ainsworth, an artist in civvie street, invents a model head of a fictious prisoner, who can take the place of an escaper, when the men march back from the bath house, which is situated outside the camp.
During World War II in a German prison camp, Lieutenant Geoffrey Ainsworth conceives the plan of constructing a collapsible life-like dummy to assist the escape of prisoners. Lieutenant Erickson if the first to try, but he is captured at the frontier and shot. An impatient American officer, Lieutenant "Texas" Nolan, decides to try on his own rather than waiting for his turn to use the dummy, and bribes a Nazi officer, Captain Shultz, who double-crosses him and shoots him at the wire. Ainsworth has been reluctant to try and escape, after a break in correspondence with a girl he has never seen, but is persuaded to make the attempt.
