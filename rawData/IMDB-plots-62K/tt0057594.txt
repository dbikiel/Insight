The day of Chief Constable Saracino begins badly when his new car is stolen. Then, in his office, he meets Alfredo Fiori who believes that his wife and her lover, a veterinary, are trying to murder him. Fiore has a witness: a parrot! During his day of work in search of his stolen car, Saracino finds out the thefts of the custom officer Mastrillo, who tries to bribe him, and the faked colonel Mazza, ran away from an asylum who convinces him to have found out a new Landru, but it was only the set of a movie. In the evening, at last, Don Amilcare recovers Saracino's car, so he can say that all is well that ends well.
