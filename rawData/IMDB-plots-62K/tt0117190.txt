A woman (Kelly Rutherford) who loses her fiance and her parents in the Titanic disaster neglects her own needs to care for her brothers and sister.
When her parents and fianc√© are lost in the Titanic disaster, young Edwina Winfield (Rutherford) shoulders the responsibility of raising her three younger siblings and taking over the reins at her father's newspaper. Although she has no shortage of new would-be suitors, the memory of her lost love continues to haunt her, so she focuses instead on providing a stable home for the children, rather than marrying. But her forcefulness alienates some of the kids, who have plans of their own and rebel against her. Can she hold her fractured family together, and will she ever overcome her ghosts to shake herself out of martyrdom and have a real life of her own?
