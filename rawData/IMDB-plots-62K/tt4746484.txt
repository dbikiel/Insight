After 15 years of marriage, a couple with two kids is about to divorce. Until the husband find a new place to live, they have to cohabit, and figure out how to share their belongings.
Fifteen years earlier, Marie, a well off young woman, had set up house with Boris, a working class man. They loved each other and had twin daughters, Jade and Margaux. But now, Marie and Boris do not get along anymore and have decided to get a divorce. The trouble is that Boris cannot afford to find a new place of his own and, in the meantime must continue to cohabit. Marie desperately wants Boris away and cannot put up with him any longer. Her partner, for his part, will not leave home unless she gives him half of what the house is worth. Marie refuses because she is the one who bought the place. Boris refuses because he renovated it and brought considerable added value to their belonging. The situation is deadlocked. How will they get out of this hell?
It's been fifteen wonderful years full of love, dreams, two twin daughters and a house to shelter their organised life together for Marie and Boris, however, tragically, their relationship is now crumbling, giving way to resentment, bitterness and separation. Regretfully, what used to be a welcoming house has now turned into an inescapable prison, a sad situation fanned by the fact that Marie who bought the house and pays for its mortgage, and Boris, a capable handyman who put hard personal work for the renovation of the property, need to cohabit since unemployed Boris cannot support himself. Eventually, inside an uneasy coexistence defined by schedules and new rules, with the girls in the middle and each party claiming its rightful share, inevitably, the already unbearable and toxic relationship is bound to deteriorate even further. Maybe, just maybe, in the end, time can really mend love..
