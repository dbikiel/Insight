Kevin Shepard is a tech-savvy young genius who uses his intelligence to slack off. When greedy video game executive Larry Wolf gets a hold of his ideas for a video game, Kevin and his best friend, Becca, set off for San Francisco to make Larry's life miserable through a series of pranks.
Kevin Shepard is a liar. It all starts when he lies about his big assignment and he is suppose to re-turn it in the next day. He completes it but when he is on his way to school he comes across a video game designer. Kevin had given him his assignment of his game and Larry Wolf steals it and which leads Kevin up to summer school. Kevin sneaks out when his dad is away and travels to San Francisco to talk to Larry Wolf. And that leads to a big, huge adventure.
