Just when the kids think their luck couldn't get any better, things start happening that make them question the intention of their crazy host.
The revenge film follows Sue Ann (Spencer), a woman who struggles with social rejection, peer pressure, and bullying. She is a lonely veterinary aide who lives in a town in Ohio. Things start to go wrong when she meets a group of teenagers. Despite their age differences, Sue Ann is invited into the clique, which she buys alcohol for. At first, it's fun for Sue Ann, who comes to be called Ma, as her friendship with the high schoolers gives her the opportunity to be social and it gets her invited to parties. However, it becomes increasingly difficult for her to let go of her friends during weekends. She eventually develops an obsessive fixation on the group. The involvement of her friends' parents also triggers past trauma. These developments lead to violence.
The 16 year-old Maggie and her mother Erica move from San Diego to a small town in the Mississippi to start a new life. Soon Maggie befriends a group of teenagers from the high-school and together they befriend the nice Sue Ann, who works at the local pet shop. She invites the teenagers to drink and party at her house but what they do not know is that Sue Ann is a psychotic woman that is plotting a revenge.
