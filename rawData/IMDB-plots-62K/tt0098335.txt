A teen film about an Italian punk forced to work with an innocent Jewish girl.
A woman returns to her high school as a teacher and convinces the school punk to become involved in the schools annual production "sing". When the board of education decides to close the school and refuses to allow the annual event to be held, the neighborhood and students come together to put the event on one last time. A cross between "Fame" and "Footloose".
