Country Doctor, Jack Jackson is called in to treat the Sick-Little-Well-Girl, who has been making Dr. Saulsbourg and is sanitarium very rich, after years of unsuccessful treatment. His old-fashioned methods do the trick and the quack is sent packing.
Dr. Ludwig von Saulsbourg is a big city physician whose primary goal is to bilk as much money out of his patients as possible. He has been treating a young woman for four years, he prescribing for her complete rest, darkness and medication, in the process billing her father exorbitant amounts of money for his services. She is not getting any better but worse based on her declining mental state about her health. In reality, she is physically healthy. When the family lawyer, Jamison, advises her father to call in a consulting physician, Dr. von Saulsbourg retaliates by advising him to move her to his expensive sanitarium. The antithesis to Dr. von Saulsbourg is kindhearted Dr. Jackson - affectionately referred to as Dr. Jack by his patients - of small town Magnolia Meadows, he who treats his patients with compassion and understanding. That understanding is knowing what truly ails his patients, which often is nothing physical or medical, and treating them without embarrassing them. When Dr. Jack is called in by Jamison as that consulting physician, he is initially unaware that this case is of the young woman who he met casually and fell in love with at first sight when she passed through Magnolia Meadows. Dr. Jack can see immediately that there is nothing physically wrong with her, and that a little excitement in her life is what is truly needed to rejuvenate her existence. What threatens Dr. Jack being able to help her is his feelings for her - which others may believe makes him an inappropriate person to treat her - and Dr. von Saulsbourg doing whatever he can to hang on to his meal ticket.
