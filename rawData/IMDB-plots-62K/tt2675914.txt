After his son is murdered by drug dealers, a snowplow driver starts seeking revenge.
Nils ploughs snow in the wild winter mountains of Norway, and is recently awarded a Citizen of the Year Award. When his son is murdered for something he did not do, Nils wants revenge. And justice. His actions ignite a war between the vegan gangster "the Count" and the Serbian mafia boss "Papa". Winning a blood feud isn't easy, especially not in a welfare state. But Nils has something going for him: Heavy machinery and beginners luck.
In the snow-capped Norwegian town of Tyos, Nils Dickman, the hard-working family man and quiet snow-plough operator, has just been named Citizen of the Year for keeping the roads open. Then, his son, Ingvar, ends up dead by the local gang of drug dealers, for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. As a result--refusing to believe the police report--Nils embarks on a blood-drenched journey of revenge, working his way up in search of the man behind the murder of his only son. Now, as the dead bodies keep piling up, Dickman and his powerful sawed-off hunting rifle will stop at nothing until they find the elusive drug lord known as "The Count". Who can stand in the way of a wronged father turned icy avenger?
