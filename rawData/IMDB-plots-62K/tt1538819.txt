When a serial killer goes after former convicted pedophiles, it is up to Police Commissioner Abbas and his Chief Celal to stop the killings.
Ensar (Nejat ler) has turned into a ruthless death machine during his military service, during which he fought terrorists in numerous clashes in southeast Anatolia. Having just completed his compulsory military service, Ensar returns home, but on the very day he comes home, he finds out that while he was away, his 12-year-old sister was raped. Later, unable to cope with the trauma, the little girl hung herself at a mental asylum she was put in following the incident. In the meantime, Ensars hometown is shaken with a number of murders. Two skillful detectives from the homicide department, Abbas (Uur Yücel) and Akrep Celal (Kenan mirzalolu), along with rookie Ezo (Berrak Tüzünataç) are assigned to investigate the murders. The case will be the last one Abbas has to solve before the retirement he has been anticipating for a long time to put into practice his plans to move to a quiet and far away place with his longtime girlfriend Cavidan (Ceyda Düvenci).
