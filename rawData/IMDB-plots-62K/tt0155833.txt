When a sexy actress is charged with murder, a charming celebrity lawyer uses trickery to defend her against the press as well as the prosecution.
An actress (Gina Gershon) accused of the murder of her brother-in-law with whom she may have been having an affair is defended by a young, naive attorney (Edward Kerr) whose strings are being pulled by a slick celebrity lawyer (James Garner). Kathleen Turner also appears as the tv tabloid "Scandal Central" talk show host who exposes the legal sham and the actress' pretense.
