A mother looks to escape her abusive past by moving to a new town where she befriends another mother, who grows suspicious of her.
A mysterious young woman, Katie (Nicky Whelan), and her daughter move to a new town to escape her past and quickly befriends Angela Morgan (Gina Gershon), a mother of one who longs for a bigger family. As their lives become intricately entwined, Angela and her husband, Brian, (Nicolas Cage), invite Katie to live in their guest-house to serve as their nanny. Over time, the blossoming friendship between the two women spirals into a dangerous obsession as Katie becomes overly attached to the Morgans' daughter. Enduring lies and manipulations, Angela and Brian realize that sweet Katie is actually trying to destroy their family from within.
After a series of miscarriages, Dr Angela, the affluent and cultivated mother of a 4-year-old daughter and a supportive husband who adores her, seems to have everything in life. Everything, but a son. With this in mind, when Angela meets through a mutual friend the charming but cryptic Katie, a single mother of a little daughter who has recently fled an abusive marriage, unexpectedly, she will become indispensable: first by earning Angela's trust and friendship, and then, as a live-in nanny. But how well does Angela know Katie, the appealing stranger with the intense fixation?
