A documentarian strikes up a friendship with reclusive artist Al Carbee, whose Barbie-doll photography gains acclaim and interest over the course of this project's 10-year history.
Filmed over 10 years, Magical Universe is a strange and inspiring portrait of Al Carbee, an 88 year old eccentric artist who spends all his days making Barbie art. The documentary chronicles the decade-long relationship between artist and filmmaker Jeremy Workman, who became Carbee's closest friend and only link to the outside world. At its core, Magical Universe is about wonder, friendship, and the transcendent power of creativity, and it culminates with Al Carbee's greatest triumph as an artist and man.
