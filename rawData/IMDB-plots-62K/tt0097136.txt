A murderer is loose in a high school in this 'whodunit' movie.
High school student Paula Carson's affections are being sought after by two of her classmates: Dwight, the "bad boy", and Brian, a disturbed young man who has just been released from a mental hospital where he was committed following the suspicious death of his father. Soon after being released, more murders start happening. Is Brian back to his old tricks, or is Dwight just trying to eliminate the competition?
Being a teenager is rough. Especially if you happen to be Paula Carson. Not only is she having relationship problems with basketball boyfriend Dwight Ingalls, but she's also being sought after by the lecherous principal and Brian Woods, who was just released from a mental hospital for killing his dad! As Paula's worries increase and the student body decreases drastically, she has to find out who is killing her pupils. Could it possibly be Dwight, who's anger management has disappeared recently? Could it be Brian, who may have never been cured? Or could it be the school principal who would do anything to get into Paula's skirt?
