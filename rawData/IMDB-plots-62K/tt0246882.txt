Emperor Raja Raja Chozan seems to count a little too much on his newly-appointed, deceptive minister. But he knows what he is doing.
After capturing Irattaipadi kingdom from Sathyasreyan in war and returning it to the rightful owners, emperor Raja Raja Chozhan takes the enemy's minister Baladevar as his own. The emperor turns a puppet in his hands making it an advantage for Baladevar to bring back the fallen Sathyasreyan's rule through a web of deception.
