A group of Italian friends is preparing for their final exams.
The film is set in an Italian high school in the late 80s. It is the summer of 1989 and Luca (Nicolas Vaporidis) and his mates are about to leave high school, as long as they pass their exams! Fully expecting never having to put up with his horrid literature teacher, Antonio Martinelli, again, Luca decides to tell him exactly what he thinks of him. But Professor Martinelli informs Luca that, owing to a colleague's illness, he will now be in charge of the exams. Oh dear... Luca's social life isn't much better, although his friends are what matters to him. One night, at a party, Luca meets the girl of his dreams, Claudia (Cristiana Capotondi), but before he can get her phone number, she is whisked away by her thuggish boyfriend Cesare (Marco Aceti). But Luca and Claudia will meet again, in a totally unpredictable way.
