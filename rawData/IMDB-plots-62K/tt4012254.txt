Two schoolteachers take their rivalry to a new level, while they scramble to win a holiday baking contest and the affections of a handsome single father.
When handsome James Thompson enrolls his daughter Lily in their new town's high-school, ever-rivaling teachers Christie Reynolds and Penny Miller both vow to win his heart. As his charity community center for the 'less privileged' organizes a benefit holiday baking contest, they instantly enter to win it, even though Christie is deemed hopeless even by her household-able mother.
