A tuna fisherman marries a woman who doesn't love him.
Mike is a great tuna fisherman although he lost a hand to a shark years earlier saving Pipes Boley. Now Mike is happily married to Quita and doesn't notice that Pipes and Quita are falling for each other.
Boisterous, Rabelaisian Portegese immigrant Mike Mascarenhas is a larger than life tuna fisherman in the waters off San Diego who captains a successful tuna boat schooner despite having lost a hand to an aggressive shark years earlier. His best friend, first mate Pipes Foley becomes his best friend after Mike rescues him from a voracious shark. When another crew member, Miguel Silva, is killed by the man-eaters, Mike takes a paternal, later romantic, interest in Miguel's pretty daughter, Quita, whom he marries. The ecstatic Mike doesn't realize that Pipes and Quita are falling in love which leads to tragic consequences.
