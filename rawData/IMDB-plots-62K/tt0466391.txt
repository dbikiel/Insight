Jane, a young soldier, is exposed to a biochemical weapon that endows her with self-healing powers. She uses her abilities to fight crime while eluding the military.
After an army unit is exposed to a biochemical weapon, everyone is killed except one young woman. She not only recovers from the exposure but has developed the ability to recover from any type of injury within days. After discovering that the army is not trying to help cure her, but rather is experimenting on her to develop a serum to be used on other soldiers, she escapes. Obviously the army wants to hunt her down and get her back under their security.
