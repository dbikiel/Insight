More than 30 years after the Academy Award triumph Born Free moved millions, To Walk With Lions brings you the dramatic continuation of George Adamson's fight to save Kenya's wildlife. Together with his young assistant Tony Fitzjohn, Adamson battles to keep the animals on his game reserve "Kora" from dangerous poachers and deadly "shifta" warriors who are determined to destroy rhinos and elephants for their tusks, and lions for their rich pelts. Academy Award Nominee Richard Harris of Gladiator and Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone takes you to the wilds of Africa in an inspirational story about one man's magnificent crusade.
