In the jungle near Angkor Wat in Cambodia, Mr. Moto poses as an ineffectual archaeologist and a venerable holy man with mystical powers to help foil two insurgencies against the government.
Mr. Moto poses as both an innocuous archaeologist and aged Buddhist mystic in French-ruled Cambodia in order to foil two anti-government revolutionary plots, one by fanatical holy man Bokor, who wants to overthrow the local leader, the self-indulgent Rajah Ali, and Ali himself, who wants to lead an insurgency against French colonial rule. Moto is aided by Vicki Mason, a daring Amelia Earhart-type aviatrix, who doubles as an international agent, and manages to rescue two bumbling newsreel photographers, Chick Davis and Marty Weston, the latter of whom seems to be attracted to the stunningly beautiful Miss Mason.
