Five stages in the romance between a woman and a man.
The end and beginning of the love of the French couple Marion and Gilles is disclosed backwards through five moments in their lives: 1st moment: They divorce and have one last brutal intercourse without love. 2nd moment: With their relationship shaken, they have a dinner party with Gilles's gay brother Christophe and his younger mate, when an infidelity is disclosed at the dinner table. 3rd moment: The troubled pregnancy of Marion and the delivery of their premature son Nicolas, with the total absence of Gilles. 4th moment: Their wedding, when Marion commits adultery with an unknown guest of the hotel. 5th moment: When they meet each other in an Italian resort and begin their relationship.
Marion and Gilles are living their last minutes as a married couple. After having formalized their divorce they will make love for the last time in a hotel, but the experience is rather traumatic for Marion and only increases the crisis between them. From this point, the story, broken down into five episodes, will run backwards, telling us the couple's married life, showing us their devoted love to their little son, but also how Gilles hurt Marion in several ways. Then we see Marion's labor at the hospital and Gilles's indifferent attitude about the matter. The two last episodes tell about their wedding and wedding night, and finally, how Marion and Gilles met each other during a trip to the Italian coast.
