Etienne Meunier is a successful businessman who has money and a beautiful wife. But all is not well in Etienne's immaculate life. He is troubled by a secret that he has been hiding.
In about three weeks, Étienne Meunier, a big household products company executive, is about to become a boss. If all goes well, 15,000 employees will be under his guidance. But, life hasn't always been a bed of roses for him; a long-forgotten reality that he recalled upon, when, out of the blue, Patrick Chambon--an old friend from high school some twenty years back--bumps into him one fateful day. Patrick claims that he is seeking advice for his latest project; nevertheless, is he still the good-hearted friend Étienne once knew?
