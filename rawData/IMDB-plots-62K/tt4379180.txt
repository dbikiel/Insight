After a bank job goes badly wrong, three desperate criminals take a young woman and a father and child hostage - it's the beginning of a frantic and violent road trip that not all of them will survive.
On paper, it was supposed to be a pure and simple bank heist; however, everything about this daring robbery in the heart of the bustling city went awry. Now, with a bag crammed with cash, a trail of dead bodies, and nearly every cop in town after them, the agitated gang leader, Sabri, and his two partners in crime are forced to think up a desperate last-minute plan to stay alive--even if it means to add kidnapping to the already heavy charges. In the heat of the moment, a young brunette, an unfortunate father, and his gravely-ill four-year-old daughter become the trigger-happy criminals' hostages, as the six of them engage in a frantic escape across the country over the course of a single day. But, in a hopeless fight for survival, nothing is what it seems..
