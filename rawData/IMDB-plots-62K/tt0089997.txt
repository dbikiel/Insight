When her father goes out of town, beautiful A-student Natalie lets best friends Jeff and Polly move in. Separately and together, the trio of young teens learn much about life, love, and growing up.
Natalie Becker is staying at home studying and working on an essay to meet the president while her father is away. Jeffrey Moran, a childhood friend (whom her father does not know) is having trouble with his stepfather, Jeremy, who is an immature bully, so she lets him stay with her. All sorts of trouble and misunderstandings ensue. Natalie's best friend Polly tries to date a pro baseball player, Zoo Knudson, and is very intrusive on Natalie's personal life, jumping to hasty conclusions. She is also ready to jump on a plane to New York to be with Zoo.
