8-year-old twins Susie (Mary-Kate Olsen) and Jessica (Ashley Olsen) live with their widowed father Stephen since their mom's death the previous year. One day they receive a letter from their mom's godmother Natty who wants them to come visit her at her dude ranch where their mom spent a lot of time growing up. Even though their dad has trouble at work with his callous boss, the family eventually manages to go visit Natty, but the ranch is in trouble: the number of paying visitors has decreased and Natty might not be able to afford it much longer. The girls want to help and begin coming up with ideas. Meanwhile, Natty's adult son Bart pushes his elderly mother to sell the ranch for the sake of her health, but Susie and Jessica suspect that he has ulterior motives.
Twins Susie and Jessica visit their mom's godmother Natty's dude ranch in the Wild West. The ranch has too few paying visitors and Natty may have to sell the ranch to evil developer Bart unless "somebody" can help her. The twins also find the diary of their deceased mom.
