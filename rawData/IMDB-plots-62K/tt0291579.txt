A young woman who is in love with a married doctor becomes dangerous when her attempts to persuade him to leave his wife are unsuccessful. However, when things are seen from his point of view, the real situation becomes clear.
Angelique, a young student, is in love with a married doctor. We see her attempts to make him leave his pregnant wife, but he does not appear for meetings or finally the booked journey to Florence. Then the movie is turned back to the beginning, and the view changes: We are now following the view of the doctor instead of Angeliques. And things look quite different now...
Comments by Actor / Writer Roy C. PetersonThis movie uses restricted editing to show first the viewpoint of a young student, Angelique, who is in love with a cardiologist, Loic. Then the narrative resets to the beginning showing the viewpoint of Loic relative to the same sequence of events. In the end the two versions converge with surprising consequences. Angelique is totally delusional about everything that happens. At the beginning we see her with a rose. We see the light of love and romance in her eyes. She thinks, and makes us believe, that Loic is her lover. Later in the Loic version we see that he just vaguely remembers handing a rose from a large bouquet he just bought for his wife to a pretty young girl (Angelique) to celebrate his wife's pregnancy. Marital effervescence to a stranger and nothing else. This a very taught, complex, and cleverly presented story about how a constitutional psychopath afflicted with DeCl√©rambault's Syndrome will stop at absolutely nothing to actualize delusion. Also called erotomania, this is a very rare disorder and should not discourage anybody from the uninhibited expression of desire and love.
