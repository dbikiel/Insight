A young, compassionate man struggles to save his family and friends from the abusive exploitation of his cold-heartedly grasping uncle.
Young Nicholas (Charlie Hunnam) and his family enjoy a comfortable life, until Nicholas' father (Andrew Havill) dies and the family is left penniless. Nicholas, his sister Kate (Romola Garai) and mother (Stella Gonet) venture to London to seek help from their Uncle Ralph (Christopher Plummer), but Ralph's only intentions are to separate the family and exploit them. Nicholas is sent to a school run by the cruel, abusive and horridly entertaining Mr. Wackford Squeers (Jim Broadbent). Eventually, Nicholas runs away with schoolmate Smike (Jamie Bell), and the two set off to reunite the Nickleby family.
After the death of his financially replete father (Andrew Havill), Nicholas Nickleby (Charlie Hunnam) and his family travel to London to seek assistance from his father's older brother Ralph (Christopher Plummer). Taking an immediate dislike to his nephew, Ralph employs Nicholas under the sadistic Mr. Wackford Squeers Jim Broadbent) and his interminable wife (Juliet Stevenson), owners of a boys' school in northern England. In the meantime, Ralph seeks to use Nicholas' beautiful sister Kate (Romola Garai) as a ploy to influence his investors. Discourse forces Nicholas to flee the school with the crippled Smike (Jamie Bell), an orphan with no memories of his former life before he was brought to Dotheboys' Hall. On their journey back to London they meet up with Vincent Crummles (Nathan Lane) and his acting troupe, befriend Ralph's good-hearted secretary Newman Noggs (Sir Tom Courtenay), and ultimately rise over adversity.
