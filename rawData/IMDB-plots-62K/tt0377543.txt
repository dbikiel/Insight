One man's courage and will to break loose from the system, and the ability of one individual to bring down the kingdom.
In a kingdom, a man is born as a child to Mother Earth. He's checked for normality, confirmed normal, and is let into the system. The man gets old, and the system has no use for him. So he's brought out to be executed. The man gets flashbacks, and understands what his life has been. So he hammers out a message on a piece of stone, for coming generations. Later, a couple finds the message, and journeys out to put an end to the oppressive system.
