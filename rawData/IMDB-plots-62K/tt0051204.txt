A married, middle-aged woman is shocked to discover that her husband, who she thought was content in their marriage, has become infatuated with a beautiful younger woman and is planning to leave his family for her.
Amy and Jim Preston have been married for twenty years but, in her husband's eyes, she has become sloppy both about the house and herself. Jim has no problems with falling in love with Georgie Harlow, a fellow-office worker who is pretty and young, and willing. Jim finally asks Amy for a divorce so he can marry Georgie, and Amy pleads for him to stay, but he walks out. He soon realizes that he can't go through with the desertion of Amy and their teenage son, Brian, and returns home.
