A special agent from Chicago is sent out west to bring in the notorious Reno brothers.
Terrorizing 1866 Indiana, the Reno brothers gang uses the town of Seymour as a safe haven, paying off three crooked town officials. Sent in to clean up the gang is Peterson Detective Agency operative James Barlow, who poses as an outlaw to gain the confidence of the officials and the thick-headed brothers. Complicating matters are Barlow's feelings for the Reno sister, Laura, who reluctantly keeps house for the boys out of family loyalty. Events heat up and rage surfaces as Barlow sets up the gang in a dawn train robbery.
Sheltered in their sister Laura's farmhouse, the notorious band of outlaws, the Reno Brothers, terrorise the Indiana countryside, in 1866. By bribing the local officials and the corrupt judge, the brothers have the nearby town of Seymour under their thumb, however, it is not before long when someone kills a secret operative. As a result, James Barlow, a former Southern spy, agrees to infiltrate the gang by posing as a hardened train robber to bring the Renos to justice, but what Barlow couldn't foresee is that his feelings for the feisty Laura will threaten his plans for a setup at dawn. In the end, can a single man end the Reno Brothers' reign?
