When a chemical warfare leaves the world barren and filled with mutated monsters, a band of survivors in a underground complex battles one of the creatures who was able to break in.
It's the post-apocalypse, and the world has been changed by "the accident", a chemical warfare experiment gone awry. At an isolated subterranean complex, a group of people survived because they were able to get the antidote for the illness. They rescue a surface survivor from the gargoyles, who unfortunately had time to impregnate her, and when the "baby" is born and escapes into the ventilation ducts, they begin experiencing an attrition problem.
Experiments in biological warfare have destroyed all but a few remnants of the human race. Alone in a lab, eight students work feverishly to create a vaccine before they are forced outside in search for food. It is then that the surviving scientists discover creatures mutated by the plague. Now they prepare to do battle against their worst fear: The Terror Within.
