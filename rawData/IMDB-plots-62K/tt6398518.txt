In the center of a freezing, misty lake, a struggling writer's solitary fishing trip is disrupted by a strange creature from the bottom of a whiskey bottle.
In this animated short film, a sailor named Hayden takes a small boat out to fish. He overstocks his boat with liquor and proceeds to drink himself into staggering inebriation. In a momentary attempt at freeing himself from his addiction, he throws his liquor bottle overboard. It sinks to the ocean floor, where a strange creature made apparently from glass and resembling Hayden himself retrieves it. The Glass Man rises to the surface and joins Hayden in his boat, where both of them drink and confront their demon.
