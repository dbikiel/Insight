Biff and Eddie are the best of friends. They are college seniors, roommates at the fraternity, and star teammates on the USC football team. Then a flapper named Babs enters the picture. Biff considers Babs his girl, and she does like him more than Eddie, but Eddie is persistent. Everywhere they go, Eddie and Biff are competing for Babs. When Eddie backs off for the sake of the friendship, Babs decides that she wants him, and this causes the friendship to end. Their rivalry even threatens the team's play in the big Stanford football game.
Biff and Eddie are the best of chums and both star football players on the University of Southern California football team. The Trojans, thanks to chummy roommates Biff and Eddie, are rolling over all teams who dare step foot on the same gridiron. But then along comes campus cutie co-ed Babs Baxter, who encourages one and does not discourage the other, and soon Eddie and Biff are not the best of chums anymore; it even appears that this may cause the USC Trojans to lose the final big game of the season to the Stanford Indians (who would later change the team name to a more P.C. - and singular - "Cardinal"). Can things get patched together before the hated rivals from Palo Alto come to town?
