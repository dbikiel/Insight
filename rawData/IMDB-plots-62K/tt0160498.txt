Four professional women meet at an East Los Angeles restaurant called Luminarias to share secrets about their careers, love, family, and sex.
Welcome to Luminarias-where hot spicy dish gets served up with a Latin twist by four successful friends from East LA...with very discriminating taste in men! When separated divorce attorney Andrea finds herself guilty of falling for her white and Jewish opposing council, her three single friends choose sides in the ongoing and often hilarious debate over race and sex. As they discover just how much negative stereotypes color their relationships with men-and even with each other-it becomes clear that the search for Mr. Right is not exactly black and white!
Opposites attract during Lent on LA's east side, as four successful chicanas near 40 without men. They drink and laugh at Luminarias, in Monterey Park. Andrea's husband has just left her for a blond. Sofia, a psychologist who's moved to the west side, sets her up with a Jewish lawyer; Andrea's anti-gringo rage tests that relationship. Sofia, in turn, has to decide if she's a wannabe White; an immigrant waiter, who loves banda music, helps her choose. Lilly, a painter, craves Lu, her new Korean boyfriend, and she's about to meet his parents. Irene gives up men for Lent and keeps her distance from her gay, cross-dressing brother. Loneliness faces each woman as they sort things out.
