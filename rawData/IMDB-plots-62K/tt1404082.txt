Ever heard your mother say, "Be careful, honey, when you marry, you also marry the family"? When Alain married Nathalie, he wasn't quite aware of the extra baggage that came along in the happy-ever-after equation: her family. Saturday night means dinner at his brother-in-law's, but Alain has reached his limit. He's sick of his brother-in-law's life advice, sick of his niece's soporific pretentious pre-dinner singing recitals, sick of watching an old wedding video for the millionth time, and definitely sick of his sister-in-law, on the verge of a psychotic break-down due to her ticking clock. But he hasn't seen the worst of it yet... until he realizes that perhaps there's some affection beneath the insufferable hysteria - one might even say love.
