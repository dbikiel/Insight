Emily Lindstrom, 14, is an aspiring concert violinist; she's spending the summer practicing for a big audition while her girlfriends are at camp. She's also got a thriving neighborhood business: for 50 cents, she'll keep your secret. Her mother is very pregnant, and her parents seem more concerned about the new baby than anything Emily cares about. A new family moves in next door; their son, Philip, 12, becomes Emily's friend. Eventually, the weight of Emily's secrets - her own, the ones she's keeping professionally, and a secret Philip tells her, send her life temporarily crashing down.
A tale centering on Emily, a plucky pre-teen (and violin virtuoso) who is entrusted with her young neighbors' most private and cherished secrets. Every Wednesday, Emily sets up a booth in her backyard which regularly attracts the guilty young souls of the neighborhood. These include Philip - the new kid on the block - whose clumsiness with an expensive chess piece (and his interest in Emily) make him one of her most challenging clients. But comedic complications ensue when the Secret Keeper 'normally so trustworthy' suddenly finds it difficult to keep all of her neighbors' secrets to herself.
