Comedian Bonnie McFarlane dons her investigative journalist's hat to find out once and for all if women are funny and report her unbiased findings in what some are calling the most important documentary of our generation.
Two aging north-eastern comedians who are on the brink of divorce, ask their friends and colleagues if female comedians are funny or not. It's more of an unanswered question than any attack on one sex or the other. The couple exchange conversation and debate with ex-lovers, famous comedians, and not-so-famous comedians and eventually end up killing a member of the media who may disagree with 1/2 of the comedy couple. The question of the title comes up time and again and forces the couple to seemingly switch sexes by disguising themselves in beards and creepy disguises to attempt and answer the reverse of the original question. Are men funnier than women? Then the relationship ends in breakdown and both comedians realize that they both aren't going to do any better and somehow Dane Cook comes out on top.
