With Britain battered by a storm, one last plane takes off. Shortly after, passengers start disappearing one by one. Those that remain frantically try to discover who - or what - is behind it before they share the same fate.
This film is about a group of people on an International flight which leaves from England during an oncoming storm. It's the last flight allowed to leave the airport. On that flight is an ancient vase from China, but is it cursed? As the flight gets further away from where it departed from it soon becomes apparent that something is not right on board. Strange things start to happen and people start going missing, but how can that be when it's only a 747? Where are they? And what's behind it all? Someone knows more than they're letting on to.
