Animated short about a love between a heron and a crane.
This animated film shows the fatalities of mutual relations, non-contacts and vanity. A film that says that living outside of time and living natural relationships is impossible, it is unacceptable that one should live in such a way that it does not hurt and hurt for lost opportunities, aimlessly lived years.
