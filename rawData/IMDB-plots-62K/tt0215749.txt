A fine magician of the Royal Court materialises an elegant attire from a transparent glass container, and then, a refined dandy appears, as an ornate palanquin is summoned. Now, what does the illusionist have in mind?
A fine magician of the Royal Court--master of trickery and illusion--takes great care to prove that the transparent glass container in front of him is absolutely empty. With his mystical power and a single fan, the great conjurer manages to materialise an elegant attire--and much to our amazement--a refined dandy appears. But that's not all. From the depths of this tiny box, yet another costume clothes a lifeless mannequin, as an ornate palanquin is summoned. Now, what does the illusionist have in mind?
A man stands in front of a backdrop painted with a nature scene. From a fan, he conjures a costume, then a woman appears inside it. An assistant carries in a mannequin; they dress her and she suddenly comes alive. The magic continues: footmen bring in a sedan chair. He covers two seated women with scarves; when he removes the scarves, the women have traded places. The women, the magician, his assistant, and the footmen continue to appear and disappear, changing places and costumes. Then they all disappear, one into another. It's time for a curtain call.
