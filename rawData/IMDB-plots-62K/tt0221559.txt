On the Edge is about suicidal patients discovering their true selves while going through therapy in a treatment center.
After the death of his alcoholic father, Jonathan Breech steals his father's ashes from his brother's house. He drives a stolen car off a cliff in order to commit suicide but he survives. After this, he accepts an alternative sentence of three months in therapy in a psychiatric hospital. There, he joins a suicide group under the supervision of Dr. Figure. He befriends a disturbed Rachel Row (who saw her mother dying in an accident) and Toby (who accidentally killed his brother in a car crash). During the treatment, the sarcastic Jonathan changes his behavior and sees the importance of being alive.
