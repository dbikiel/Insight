'Latitudes', a modern love story shot in 8 different countries, tells the story of Olivia (Alice Braga) and Jose (Daniel de Oliveira), two travellers who have one-night stands in legendary hotels every time they meet accidentally as they wander around the world on business trips. At first an idealised, secretive relationship by two jet-setters, the story becomes one of how to cope with all the real life challenges waiting for the two outside the hotel room.
