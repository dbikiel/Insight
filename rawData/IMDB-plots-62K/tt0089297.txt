Macabea has just moved to the big city after her aunt, who raised her, died. She gets a job as a typist and moves into a boarding house with three other women. In her spare time she listens to time Radio Station; on Sundays she likes to ride the subways. She describes herself saying, "I am a typist and a virgin, and I like Coca-Cola." Then she meets Olimpico, a north-easterner like herself, who has dreams of becoming a Congressman.
A typical story of the Latin American reality. Macabea is a poor and less educated woman who comes from her small town to a large city in Brazil - SÃ£o Paulo. Once there she finds a job but soon loses it due to her lack of education and hygiene, and has to live in a small room with other women in the same condition (working class single women) and only with the illusion (after a visit to a fortune teller) to meet a tall, blond and rich man to fall in love with her an take her away from poverty
This Brazilian film is about a north-eastern immigrant orphan in Brazil named Macabea, a religious reference to the Macabee, who moves to the big city in an attempt to escape economic and social poverty. Unfortunately, she struggles to little avail. She makes little progress in the way of imporoving her life because of her severe deprivation of social skills, hygiene, nutrition, and formal education.
