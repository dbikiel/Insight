Original film was called "Teenagers Battle the Thing" made in 1958. Approximately 59 minutes.
A group of high school students on an archaeological dig discover a centuries old mummified body in a sealed cave. Removing the mummy, it soon comes back to life, revealing itself to be an inhuman beast that terrorizes a small California town.
A high school teacher and his class are having a discussion about Sasquatch (a.k.a. Bigfoot). As the discussion is going on, another teacher enters the class and tells the disbelieving students that he actually saw such a creature and that it not only was responsible for several deaths, but that it also was responsible for the nervous breakdowns of several students who saw the creature also. He then goes on to tell the story about how he took his class on an archaeological dig in the forest some ten years earlier. During the dig they found a mummy and removed it from its tomb. Amazingly, the mummy comes back to life and terrorizes a small town and kills several people in the process. In the end, the monster is cornered, doused with gasoline and set on fire killing it.
