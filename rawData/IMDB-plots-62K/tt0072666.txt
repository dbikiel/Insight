A mad scientist transforms himself into an aquatic killer.
A mad scientist (and apparent former Nazi) unleashes his master plan: to transform himself into a mutated walking catfish, gain revenge on those who have spurned him, and kidnap nubile young women to similarly transform so that he can breed. Or something like that.
A shuffling, evil marine biologist/janitor who speaks only in voice-overs develops a process to turn people into super-powerful amphibious sea creatures. Once he transforms himself, however, he seems to lose focus, as he starts Windexing a nearby pond. Only later does he vaguely start chasing after nubile women so that he can transform them as well, mate, and produce a race of super beings which will RULE THE WORLD!!
