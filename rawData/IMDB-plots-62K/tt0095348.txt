In this parody of blaxploitation movies, a black hero wannabe reunites former black heroes from the 70s to help him get revenge on Mr. Big.
Jack Spade returns home from the army in his old ghetto neighborhood when his brother, Junebug dies from O.G. - over gold. Jack declares war on Mr. Big, powerful local crime lord. His army is led by John Slade, his childhood idol who used to fight bad guys in the '70s.
