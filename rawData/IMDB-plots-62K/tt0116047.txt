A no holds barred look into the gaping divisions which exist within an Aboriginal settlement in outback Australia. These separations split the inhabitants, straining relationships until something has to give.
In the desert village of Wala Wala, a jailed Aboriginal is found dead in local lawman Ray Lorkin's police lock-up. In an attempt to reconcile Aboriginal traditions vs. Australian law, Lorkin allows Mannga, the father of the dead prisoner, a "pay back" to restore order. But conflict heightens when the local school teacher's wife's passionate affair with her husband's Aboriginal teacher's aide leads to sacrilege and murder.
