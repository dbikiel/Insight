A determined young woman and a damaged occultist risk their lives and souls to perform a dangerous ritual that will grant them what they want.
Sophia Howard rents a house in the countryside of Wales and hires the occultist Joseph Solomon to contact her son that was kidnapped and murdered by teenagers practicing black magic. Along the days, Sophia follows the guidance of Solomon in rituals to purify her soul. However Sophia has a hidden agenda that jeopardizes their lives.
Refusing to come to terms with the death of her boy three years ago, the young Catholic mother, Sophia Howard, is prepared to do whatever it takes, even if she has to subject herself to the onerous labour of performing a prolonged and elaborate Hermetic ritual. As a last resort, the eager mother rents a quiet cottage in the remote North Wales Highlands, and persuades the Gnostic ceremonial mage, Joseph Solomon, to guide her through the intricate preparations. Determined to proceed regardless of the consequences, Sophia seals herself in the house along with Joseph, until the invocation that promises to unshackle the unseen realms, is done. However, even though strange synchronicities begin to occur, the sophisticated and dangerous rite that provides conversation and knowledge to the invoker is still fruitless, forcing Joseph to question Sophia's intentions. Is cryptic Sophia's drive, indeed, pure? Will the otherworldly Dark Song lead to the ultimate truth?
