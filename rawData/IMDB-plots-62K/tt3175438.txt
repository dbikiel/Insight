Four days in the lives of an exorcist (Eloy Palma) and his granddaughter (Alba), working in the Barcelona area.
Roaming Spain's rugged countryside, a pair of travelling exorcists--the grizzled preacher, Eloy de Palma, and his gifted young granddaughter, Alba--attempt to free the immortal souls of the unfortunate ones who are grievously afflicted by the mark of the demonic Evil One. Under those circumstances and with only a few days away before the cryptic "Resurrection" takes place, Eloy and Alba find themselves embarking on a desperate and frenzied exorcism spree, as more and more people become possessed by the evil entity. But, can they make it in time?
Asmodexia recounts five days in the life of an exorcist and his granddaughter, who practice their rituals along the Devil torn areas. Both will face the most terrible of a kind of demonic possession that seems to be infecting the purest souls cases.
