A rookie flyer, Ens. Alan Drake, joins the famous Hellcats Squadron right out of flight school in Pensacola. He doesn't make a great first impression when he is forced to ditch his airplane and parachute to safety when he arrives at the base but is unable to land due to heavy fog. On his first official outing, his poor shooting skills results in the Hellcats losing an air combat competition. His fellow pilots accept him anyway but they think he's crossed the line when they erroneously conclude that while their CO Billy Gray is away, Drake has an affair with his wife Lorna. Drake is now an outcast and is prepared to resign from the Navy but his extreme heroism in saving Billy Gray's life turns things around.
Ensign Alan Drake is assigned to the elite "Hell Cat" squadron of Navy fliers based in San Diego, despite being relatively inexperienced. Getting off on bad footing by ruining the squadron's chances of winning a target-shooting competition, Drake is encouraged by Jerry Banning, an officer whose sister Lorna is the wife of the squadron commander, William Gary. Drake and Banning work on a device to help aircraft land in the fog, but when Banning is killed testing it and Drake appears to be getting romantically entangled with Lorna, the men of the squadron turn on Drake. Only when Commander Gary himself is in jeopardy does Drake get a chance to show his fellow fliers what kind of man he really is.
