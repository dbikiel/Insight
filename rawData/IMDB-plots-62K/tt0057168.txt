Jenny Bowman (Judy Garland) is a successful singer who, while on an engagement at the London Palladium, visits David Donne (Sir Dirk Bogarde) to see her son Matt (Gregory Phillips) again, spending a few glorious days with him while his father is away in Rome in an attempt to attain the family that she never had. When David returns, Matt is torn between his loyalty to his father and his affection for Jenny.
