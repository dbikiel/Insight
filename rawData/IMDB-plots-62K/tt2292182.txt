A group of complete strangers find themselves isolated by a wealthy madman on his island compound.
A wealthy madman who has lost his son in a drug accident gone awry kidnaps a group of people responsible for his death. The group of complete strangers find themselves isolated on his island compound. They are forced into a horrifying gauntlet where they must survive a barrage of ever deadlier species of shark. In increasing difficult tests set by the madman and his masochistic mistress, the group must navigate a series of tasks or die trying. The island is apparently well wired for hidden cameras, microphones and speakers so the madman can watch and communicate to the group over the 7 days of the challenges he presents. The group's size slowly diminishes as they succumb to the increasingly difficult and dangerous tasks. The resulting final survivor ends up in a final climactic scene where a confrontation occurs with the groups tormentors.
