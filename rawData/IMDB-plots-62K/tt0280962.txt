A terrifying love triangle. An original twist on a story of divided loyalties, the perils of love and ultimate death. A haunting tale set in a London at times beautiful and ugly, but always captivating. A story that plays with the shadows and light of an underworld occupied by the fascinating and terrible.
Jon Bennet is an ideal employee: neat, efficient and conscientious. Nobody would guess that this self-conscious introvert kills to earn his living, but for those who understand his trade Jon is more than just a journeyman murderer, he is an artist of growing reputation. Jon works for The Tattooed Man, an awesome figure whose taste for cruelty is only outweighed by his erudite learning and penchant for philosophy. The Tattooed Man takes care of Jon. He feeds, clothes and educates his protege, asking for nothing in return but unquestioning loyalty. By chance Jon encounters Andy and Cathy - old friends from school, now married with child - and the cosy normality of their lives awakens him to the unsatisfactory nature of the twilight world he inhabits. As Jon finds himself drawn towards Cathy in a way he has never experienced before, he begins to question everything he has become. Torn between Cathy and The Tattooed Man, he is Mr In-Between. But the Tattooed Man cannot tolerate any form of rival. Jon must act, and act fast. Everything is at stake. Not just the safety of his friends, but also the redemption of his soul.
