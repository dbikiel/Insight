The family cat, out for the night, stalks and catches a bird singing atop the weathervane, but it flies off, pulling the cat and weathervane down and knocking the cat out. The cat has a vision of giant birds, lacking the tailfeathers he pulled out, tormenting him, and soon, everything in the autumn landscape is animated and scary.
