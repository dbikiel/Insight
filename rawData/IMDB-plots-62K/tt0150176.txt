The trials and tribulations of wealthy young Manhattanites and their sexual coming of age, a romantic comedy set at an Upper East Side prep school.
Three young women come together in college and quickly determine that one has never had an orgasm, they quickly decide that they are going to make sure she has one (thus the not too subtle film title). The three then set out a sexual adventures. One takes up with a popular, arrogant boy who is of course more interested in his own pleasure than hers. Waiting in the wings is a sensitive outsider, who everyone immediately knows is the one who will float her boat.
Upscale Manhattan teens: Stream Hodsell, a down-to-earth beauty, takes a challenging and sometimes outrageous journey into womanhood with her two best friends, sassy Jenny Simon and soulful Nell Kellner, by her side. In between managing her ex-hippie mother, her indifferent dad and the pressure to get into the best possible college, Stream tries to get real about her own needs as a young woman. Over the course of their senior year, the girls cope with the usual trials and situations of growing up - like SAT's, test flights from the nest and the mysteries of romance. Our savvy heroines also face a few more unusual challenges. Nell takes a foray into the bizarre world of fashion modeling; Jenny deals with her ongoing obsession with looking too rich and too thin, and Stream negotiates the petty squabbles of her recently divorced parents both hell-bent on reliving their adolescence.
