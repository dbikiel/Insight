Max and Eddy are washed up pro snowboarders from the '90s who ruined their careers with reckless behavior. Working as lift operators at Stubby Peaks, they decide to start a snowboard camp/team in order to get back on top of the snowboarding scene. Kingsley Brown, their old rival and head of the National Snowboard Association, blackballs the camp trying to keep "those reckless maniacs" away from the sport. Max and Eddy must now go on an intense search to find some amazing hopefuls to join their team and compete in the upcoming snowboarding event.
SHRED is a motion picture that tells the story of two washed up pro snowboarders from the 90s named Max (played by Dave England) and Eddie (played by Renee Renee) who attempt to cash in on the fantastic growth of the sport by starting their own snowboard camp. Hoping to recapture their former glory, they begin by sharing their wacky wisdom with a group of up and coming young snowboarders. The story takes them from the run down ski hill where they grew up to a major event at one of the biggest resorts in the west.
