In Hawaii, an undercover DEA agent and her civilian friend stumble upon a drug trafficking operation, and have to enlist the help of all their colleagues/friends to go after the vicious drug kingpin.
Two drug enforcement agents are killed on a private Hawaiian island. Donna and Taryn, two operatives for The Agency, accidentally intercept a delivery of diamonds intended for drug lord Seth Romero, who takes exception and tries to get them back. Soon other Agency operatives get involved, and a full-scale fight to the finish ensues, complicated here and there by an escaped snake made deadly by Toxic Waste!
The seductively dangerous drug enforcement secret agent Donna and her devastatingly lethal colleague Taryn are transferred back to the idyllic paradise of Molokai in Hawaii, where sadly, the vicious drug kingpin Mr Chang and his brutal lead distributor Seth Romero have established a base for their burgeoning criminal business. But things will take a turn for the worse, when the girls while carrying unbeknownst to them a crate of a gigantic python contaminated with deadly toxins, they will intercept a remote-controlled scale model helicopter with a special cargo intended for Romero. Before long, Donna and Taryn will find themselves on a death list as Seth's evil henchmen will stop at nothing to get back what is theirs, while in the meantime, the venomous reptilian adversary is on the loose. Undoubtedly, there will be trouble in paradise, but no one, not even destructive bazookas, explosive grenades and crazed crime lords can stand in the way of the blonde female ninjas.
