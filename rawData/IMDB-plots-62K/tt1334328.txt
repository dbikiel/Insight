Near the end of the Greek Civil War two brothers find themselves in opposite sides.
During the 1946-49 Greek Civil War, young brothers Anestis and Vlassis are recruited by opposing sides. Anestis joins the National Army while Vlassis becomes a soldier in the Democratic Army. Fighting in the countryside they grew up in, the boys become increasingly fanatical as the war progresses.
