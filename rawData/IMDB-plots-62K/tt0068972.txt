Things get complicated when Ewa discovers her affair with her husband and, in a raptus of jealousy, she kills her by walling her alive. But a few days later, during a masquerade party, Greta mysteriously reappears with a skeletal face and begins to persecute Ewa pushing her to suicide - and the dead will not end here .
