A satirical comedy about an unsophisticated country boy who treks off to Chicago, Illinois, gets shot by mobsters, and awakens to find that he has the powers of Superman.
Jon Voight journeys to the big city and becomes disillusioned and corrupted. No, it's not MIDNIGHT COWBOY. It's FEARLESS FRANK (1967) Voight's first film role.
Frank leaves Ma and Pa behind on the farm to find his destiny. On the road he meets a writer, (Ken Nordine - known for WORD JAZZ and voice overs of psychedelic 60's LEVIS commercials) who becomes the narrator of Frank's incredible comic-book adventure.
Frank falls for Plethora (Monique Van Vooren) the first girl he sees in the city. Unfourtunately she is the girlfriend of The Boss, a criminal master-mind with power over smoke and a cadre of colorful DICK TRACY-like henchmen (including comedian David Stienberg as The Rat), so Frank is rubbed out on the spot.
This would normally be the end of the movie, but this movie could never be called normal. Frank's bullet riddled corpse is found by The Good Doctor (Severn Darden) and Faithful Alfred his butler (Anthony Holland).
They spirit the corpse back to the lab and re-construct Frank. Better, stronger, faster, bulletproof, and able to fly, Frank is to become The Good Doctor's Instrument to fight evil.
All does not go smoothly, as the more Frank fights evil, the more he is seduced by violence and the wicked ways of the big city.
Will Frank regain his lost innocence and win Plethora?
What about The Good Doctor's evil brother and his super-clone False Frank?
How will, how can, Frank triumph over The Boss, and his own dark nature?
Find out in this painfully droll, super low budget, un-special effects shlock fest.
