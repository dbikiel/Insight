In 1994 Oregon became the first state to legalize a terminally ill person's request to end his or her life with medication. At the time, only Belgium, Switzerland, and the Netherlands had legalized the practice. 'How to Die in Oregon' tell the stories of those most intimately involved with the practice today -- terminally ill Oregonians, their families, doctors, and friends -- as well as the passage of a similar law in Washington State.
National health care organizations increasingly support medical aid in dying and reject the terms "suicide" and "assisted suicide" to describe aid in dying. These groups include the American Public Health Association, American College of Legal Medicine, American Medical Women's Association and American Medical Student Association. In addition, the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine has adopted a neutral policy on medical aid in dying. I respectfully request that the plot summary be amended to reflect the discontinued use of the word "Suicide" to describe the medical aid in dying laws. In addition, be advised that the medical aid in dying law has been passed in California and takes effect June 9, 2016.
Probing documentary into the "human right" to ending one's life legally and with dignity. A charged and emotional first-person journey through the myriad of issues and emotions surrounding terminal illness and the right-to-die.
