Matthew 15:1 - 28:20 - The year is about 62 A.D., and the aging apostle Matthew recalls the remarkable events he witnessed as a young man. As his story unfolds, the centuries melt away and we are intimately involved in the life of Jesus. We share the mystery and the wonder of His birth. We witness His baptism and temptation in the wilderness. We experience the compassion and hope of the Sermon on the Mount. Walk with Jesus through Galilee as He calls His disciples, performs the first miracles, and begins teaching His world-changing message of love and redemption. This deeply moving presentation of the most beloved of stories stars luminary Richard Kiley as Matthew and the passionate Bruce Marchiano as Jesus. This unique word-for-word presentation in the NIV brings to the screen a divine yet warmly human Jesus. "I've been a Christian for 25 years, but I never knew who Jesus truly was until I saw Matthew... He loves me!" In 1993, Christian filmmakers set out to make a Jesus film which would be Word-for-Word the Gospel. What emerged was a presentation of Jesus in exultant joy (Hebrews 1:9) and deep passion - a Man who was God on His knees in the sand, weeping over people's pain, reaching His healing hand into their broken lives; a Man who restrained all the power of the universe and allowed His blood to fall to the ground...for you. Come experience Jesus as never before! Word for Word Matthew (NIV), this film which has seen countless testimonies like that above is as arresting on this 15th anniversary of its USA release as then. Come experience God's Word afresh, and His promises for you anew. Come, experience Jesus!
