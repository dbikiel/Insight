A New York playboy dates wild woman until he falls for a hard-working stenographer.
Wayne Carter is a wealthy Manhattan businessman and partying playboy, he not caring about the marital status of the women with who he cavorts. His butler, Rollins, although tries to convince him that he would be happier falling in love and settling down, nonetheless aspires to his boss' lifestyle. Wayne, however, truly is tiring of his womanizing ways. Helene and Lita Andrews are sisters living together in a one room apartment. Helene is the more sensible one, she who is a currently unemployed but trained stenographer, and who supports Lita while Lita tries to get work as a dancer on the stage. Lita, however, would rather that some rich man marry and pamper her. Through indirect means, Wayne meets the sisters. Impressed by Helene and the good head she has on her shoulders, Wayne later tracks her down solely to offer her a well paying job as his executive assistant, he not having any ulterior motives in his offer. Despite being suspect that he is only after her as a woman, she accepts. In time, the two form a trusting business relationship, which slowly turns to attraction and love on both sides. But Helene isn't sure if Wayne has truly given up his womanizing ways, especially as some of his past conquests don't seem to want to leave him alone, one in particular, married Agatha Carraway, whose jealous husband, Herb Callaway, a friend of Wayne's, will shoot to kill anyone he suspects of fooling around with his wife. In addition, Helene has to deal with some personal issues that Lita is facing with a man she suspects is much like the old Wayne.
