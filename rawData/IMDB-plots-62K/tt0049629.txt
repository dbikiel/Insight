On a trip to Europe, her prize in a "fixed" beauty contest, Kathy Allne (Arlene Dahl)meet advertising man Tim O'Bannion (Philip Carey), who is attracted by her beauty but repelled by her ruthlessness towards men. In London, she ruins the career of photographer Larry Buckham (Michael Goodliffe)and compromises Tim's boss, Stephen Collins (Herbert Marshall). About to steal Colloins from his wife, Kathy learns that the wife's father, the elderly John Dowling (Ralph Truman)actually owns the world-wide advertising agency, so she marries him and,later, accidentally kills him, mistaking him for a prowler. But she is found guilty of murder and sentenced to die. Will this innocent gold-digger actually be executed?
