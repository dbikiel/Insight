In the 1980s, an outsider gets invited to a mythical nightclub where he's unleashed to punk, sexual liberty and drugs.
Seventeen-year-old Carlos doesn't fit in anywhere, not in his family nor with the friends he has chosen in school. But everything changes when he is invited to a mythical nightclub where he discovers the underground nightlife scene: punk, sexual liberty and drugs.
Questioning his role within the soul thieving conformity of mid-'80s Mexico City, 17-year-old Carlos is loath to participate in adolescent machismo antics, preferring instead to tinker with electronics while listening to classic rock. He has a kindred spirit and best friend in Gera and a burgeoning infatuation with Gera's untouchably cool sister Rita, an artist at ease with her outsider status. When Rita invites them to see her band at infamous avant-garde club the Aztec, they're introduced to an uninhibited world of performance art, edgy music, and sexual fluidity-welcome counteragents to two-fisted teen politics and the imminent threat of adulthood. Inspired by club owner and progressive artist Nico, wide-eyed Carlos experiments with identity politics, tasting the forbidden fruits of hedonism at the expense of Gera's devotion.
