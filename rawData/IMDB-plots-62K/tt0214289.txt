Eddie, Dov, and Yvan are back, still working in Paris' Sentier textile district, This time they're confronting the high-stakes world of large distribution after striking a deal with Eurodiscount, a European hypermarket chain.
The gang is back, with Eddie, Dov, and Yvan still in the textile industry and working in Paris' Sentier district. After an umpteenth problem with an independent retailer who can't cover the cost of merchandise, they decide to aim for the guaranteed safety of a large distribution contract with an established chain. Eventually, they do make it big, striking a deal with Eurodiscount, a European hypermarket chain (combination supermarket and department store). However, their joy dissipates as Eddie and Yvan quickly learn who dictates the rules when dealing with a large chain. Meanwhile, Dov, chased out of his home by his wife, Karine, after yet another extramarital affair, leaves with Patrick for California, hoping to strike a business deal there, and Serge, now a struggling delivery man, falls in love with a young girl from a good family whom he fools into believing that he's wealthy by taking over his cousin Patrick's home and belongings during his absence, and by spending the mob's money, which Serge is supposed to launder. Things go from bad to worse and the business is lost, until Eddie discovers that his bankruptcy goes beyond the mere commercial failure and that he was the victim of a scandalous swindle perpetrated by the heads of Eurodiscount. From then on, he decides to take revenge and conceives a plan that will mobilize and re-group the gang, giving Serge an important role that may let him pay off his debts and win the heart of his inamorata.
