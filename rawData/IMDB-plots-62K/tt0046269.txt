After her banishment from Rome, Jewish Princess Salome returns to her Roman-ruled native land of Galilee where prophet John the Baptist preaches against Salome's parents, King Herod and Queen Herodias.
In the reign of emperor Tiberius, Gallilean prophet John the Baptist preaches against King Herod and Queen Herodias. The latter wants John dead, but Herod fears to harm him due to a prophecy. Enter beautiful Princess Salome, Herod's long-absent stepdaughter. Herodias sees the king's dawning lust for Salome as her means of bending the king to her will. But Salome and her lover Claudius are (contrary to Scripture) nearing conversion to the new religion. And the famous climactic dance turns out to have unexpected implications...
As John the Baptist, the incendiary prophet, preaches the coming of Jesus the Messiah in turbulent Galilee, the lascivious King Herod and his plotting wife, Queen Herodias, welcome back to the kingdom the statuesque Princess Salome. Freshly banished from Rome for her fervent affair with Caesar's nephew, the beautiful stepdaughter will soon find comfort in the arms of the Roman commander, Claudius, while in the meantime, the seditious Baptist becomes all the more a thorn in Herodias' side. Soon, the decision for John the Baptist's head will be taken; a decision so cruel and dangerous, that not even the seductive "Dance of the Seven Veils" won't be enough to save the martyr's life.
