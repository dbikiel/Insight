A documentary on the safety of nuclear storage.
The subject of "Into Eternity" is Onkalo, the Finnish government's attempt to solve its nuclear waste problem by carving a vast, 4km-deep bunker out of solid rock to bury it in for at least the next 100,000 years. However, the film's focus is bigger. Instead of looking for cover-ups and conspiracies at the site, Madsen uses the existence of Onkalo to create a hauntingly beautiful meditation on the mortality of our civilization, asking the question: what do we say about ourselves when we create something that will outlast everything we understand? That may be the last thing that remains of our society?
Finland has decided to bury its nuclear waste several kilometres underground in a facility called Omika (hiding place). This film discusses why this is being done and what the ramifications of this are both to Finland and the rest of the World. It includes interviews with nuclear scientists and government representatives.
