For the first time on the big screen, the film tells the fascinating story of one on the world's most famous wines and how it exploded as a world phenomenon.
For the first time on the big screen, Barolo Boys. The Story of a Revolution tells the fascinating story of a group of friends who bring a revolution in the Langhe, and how Barolo exploded as a world phenomenon. Now one of the most famous red wines in the world, 30 years ago Barolo was unknown even in its own production region, the beautiful Langhe (just nominated UNESCO World Heritage Site), in northwestern Italy. Barolos current success is mainly due to the courage and initiative of a group of small-scale wine producers, the so-called Barolo Boys.
In the optimistic Eighties, these winemakers upset the quiet world of the Piedmontese countryside and brought about a revolution in Italian wine, igniting a fierce controversy between different generations and different ways of thinking.
After almost 30 years, what is left of that experience? As one of the films characters asks, what revolution has ever been successful? Barolo Boys. The Story of a Revolution traces the short but intense trajectory of a group of producers who indelibly changed the world of wine.
