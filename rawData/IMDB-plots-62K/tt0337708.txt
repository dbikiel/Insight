A German rocket scientist arrives on a small Scotish island in the mid 1930s. He's there to run tests on a new type of rocket that is to be used for mail delivery between the island and the mainland. Initially he's met with scepticism, but slowly the islanders come to like and trust him. One of the young women falls in love with him, but with WWII around the corner life gets complicated.
