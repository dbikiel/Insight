Buster and his family go on a voyage on his homemade boat that proves to be one disaster after another.
Buster's handmade boat, The Damfino, is finished and is, of course, too large to get through the basement door. When he drives off with it in tow, the side of his house, then the whole thing, collapses. At the harbor he rides the boat out only to have it sink beneath him. The rest is a series of adventures he and his family have with the restored boat.
At last, the Damfino, Buster's graceful but somewhat hulking boat, is ready after a considerable amount of elbow grease. Ecstatic and undaunted by minor setbacks on the way, the proud family man and architect of this small marine wonder sets off to the wide open sea, bent on offering his wife and his two lovely kids an unforgettable cruise. However, a terrible storm is brewing. Is the newly-christened vessel seaworthy?
