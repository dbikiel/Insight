Federal agent John Tipton heads for Wyoming to supervise the vote on whether to join the Union. One group of locals is using dynamite to terrorize the populace and a local newspaper editor is killed.
Federal Agents Tipton and Bridger have been sent to Wyoming where the vote on statehood is imminent. Plummer and his gang are out to make sure the vote fails. When Plummer's men kill Bridger, Tipton fights on. He sends fake telegrams that trap some of Plummer's men. Then he organizes the ranchers and on election day they descend on the town barricaded by Plummer's gang.
While the honest citizens of the Wyoming Territory are working to gain statehood, their efforts are hampered by marauding outlaws. Undercover government agents John Tipton and Bridger are sent to Crockett City to help ensure an honest statehood election. John and Bridger split up and John befriends a trio of settlers harassed by outlaws. They are Major Carter, his daughter Janet and their servant Moses. Carter is coming as the new editor and publisher of the Crockett City Blade, and when he announces plans to use the power of the press to fight lawlessness and aid the statehood cause, he is warned by Charles Plummer, chairman of the Law and Order Committee, that his is not a healthy stance. Bridger is murdered when a wiretapper in Plummer's employ intercepts a telegram revealing Bridger's identity as a government agent, and Major Carter dies when he is "accidently" shot from a pre-staged fight between two of the gang members. A trap set by John captures most of the gang members but he still doesn't know who the leader of the gang is; he soon learns when taken prisoner by Plummer and his remaining henchmen.
Run of the mill early western about the impending statehood of the Wyoming territory. John Wayne as the usual white knight government man trying to preserve the integrity of the vote. Nice to see a pre-Gabby, George Hayes. Fun interactive performances by Snowflake and Etta McDaniel.
