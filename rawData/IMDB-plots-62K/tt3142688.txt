A man embarks on a road trip to find his lost love.
Late one night, an undelivered letter is returned to postmaster and singer Ferdinand 'Ferdie' Pinto. He realizes that his one true love Stefanie 'Fanny' Fernandes never received the marriage proposal he sent to her forty-six years earlier. Angie, a young widow and Ferdie's dear friend suggests they go on a road trip to find Fanny. Joining them on the journey is Rosie, Angie's mother-in-law; and Don Pedro, an artists who is keen to paint Rosie. Driving the car is Savio, the childhood friend whose heart Angie broke six years earlier when she married another.
