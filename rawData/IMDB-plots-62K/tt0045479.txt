Grainbelt University has one attraction for Dobie Gillis - women, especially Pansy Hammer. Pansy's father, even though and maybe because she says she's in dreamville, does not share her affection for Dobie. An English essay which almost revolutionizes English instruction, and Dobie's role in a chemistry lab explosion convinces Mr. Hammer he is right. Pansy is sent off broken-hearted to an Eastern school, but with the help of Happy Stella Kolawski's all-girl band, several hundred students and an enraged police force, Dobie secures Pansy's return to Grainbelt.
Dobie Gillis and Charlie Trask are roommates and fellow freshmen at Grainbelt University. Their primary goal at Grainbelt is to have fun. At the initial freshman dance, Charlie becomes interested in Lorna Ellingboe, who likes Dobie, who in turn likes Pansy Hammer. Pansy initially resists Dobie's advances as she, unlike Charlie, Lorna and Dobie, is at Grainbelt to learn, learn, learn through work, work, work, at least according to her strict father as per the university's motto. To gain Pansy's favor, Dobie lies and tells her that he too is there to learn through work. Charlie, Lorna, Dobie and Pansy end up spending all their time together in pairs - Charlie with Lorna, and Dobie with Pansy - doing what Pansy wants until Pansy finally comes to the conclusion that she really wants to have fun. As much as Dobie wants to have fun, he still wants to be in Mr. Hammer's good books (Mrs. Hammer is on their side), but one thing after another seems to place Dobie in a bad light in his eyes, and ultimately in the eyes of the school's administration. After Mr. Hammer decides to get Pansy away from Dobie by sending her to school in New York instead, Dobie, with Charlie and Lorna's help, tries to figure out a way either to get to New York or get Pansy back to Grainbelt. Their schemes get them into one predicament after another. But are these obstacles enough to stop the course of true love?
