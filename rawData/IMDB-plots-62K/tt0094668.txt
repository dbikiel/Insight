In a vast futuristic city, built on the ashes of the third world war, a police officer and her cyborg partner fight terrorism.
Officer Deunan Knute and her cyborg partner Briaros Hecatonchires must prevent terrorists from gaining control of the Olympus city computer and causing massive chaos. As they fight to stop the terrorists and preserve their society, the question of who is actually in the right--their society, or the "terrorists"--continues to arise.
