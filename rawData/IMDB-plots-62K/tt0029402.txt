A hungry little pig eats a couple of pies off the windowsill. When it's time for dinner, he ties together the spaghetti of all the other little pigs and eats it all. That night, he has a nightmare where he is force-fed by a mad scientist.
The story focuses on a mother pig and her children. Of all of them, one named Piggy seems to be quite a glutton. First he swipes a pie cooling on the windowsill, and then eats all the spaghetti for dinner. His mother cautions him that if he keeps eating like this, he'll burst. However, Piggy is more annoyed with her lecture than acknowledging.That night, Piggy lays in bed, thinking of all sorts of foods. Falling asleep, he dreams of meeting an old man who invites him into his house. Inside the house are all types of food. Piggy takes a seat in a chair, rubbing his belly with anticipation. But it is then revealed that the old man is a mad scientist. Piggy's chair then turns into a metal chair with a clamp that comes down over his nose. The scientist roars with laughter, saying he'll give Piggy plenty of his favorite foods.The chair is then lowered into the basement, where Piggy is force-fed all manner of foodstuffs. After sometime, Piggy is returned to the main room, only now he has swollen immensely in size, nearly bursting out of the chair. The scientist lets him go, chiding that Piggy isn't even 'half-full.' As Piggy waddles towards the door, he spies a roasted chicken on a nearby table. Eagerly, he tears off a leg and takes a bite, only to explode!Piggy then wakes from his dream, and breathes a sigh of relief. Soon however, his Mother calls him to breakfast, which causes him to rush downstairs and start scooping up his meal like a greedy little piggy, having forgotten the consequences of his dream.
