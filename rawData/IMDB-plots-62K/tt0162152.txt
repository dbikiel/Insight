The events occur during the Armenian-Azerbaijanian/Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Because of a corpse in a zinc coffin with an arguable address two families get excited. Having cut the lid off the coffin for identification of a dead soldier they find out that he is not Azerbaijanian but Armenian - former dweller of Baku.
