Mayor Stiles' daughter Donna is killed the night after a lousy date with the shy Mitch. Of course this makes him the main suspect. When Mitch gets free on bail, Styles hires ex-cop Mace to follow him. Mace learns immediately that someone's after Mitch's life - and after his and prostitute Sarah's too, as soon as they're seen together. Unfortunately it's a cop who's after them, murdering witnesses and faking evidence against Mace. So Sarah has to give her best to soothe the pain of being accused while innocent.
