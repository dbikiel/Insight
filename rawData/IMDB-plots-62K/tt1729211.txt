The heroes from "Männerherzen - Men in the city" return and are searching for their "one and only true great love" more vigorously than ever, which also happens to be the name of Schlager singer Bruce Bergers new song. Günther, Niklas and Philip now work for Bruce's label and while their boss bites off "a bit" more than he can chew, Jerome is taking a sabbatical in the country at his parents' house. Niklas is playing the dating game while Philip becomes a father and Günther has very particular issues in his relationship. A truly great comedy for men and women with heart and mind.
