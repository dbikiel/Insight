Harold Bledsoe, a botany student, is called back home to San Francisco, where his late father had been police chief, to help investigate a crime wave in Chinatown.
The San Francisco Police Department is receiving bad press for not being able to control the illegal activities in Chinatown, especially that of an unknown figure named "The Dragon", who leads a dope ring and commits tong murders. As such, Captain Walton of the 3rd Division, which is Chinatown's jurisdiction, decides to call in Harold Bledsoe, the son of the former renowned and now deceased police chief, Jim Bledsoe, to assist in the investigation, despite the Captain not knowing anything about Harold. Harold ends up being nothing like his father, Harold being a bespectacled, fussbudget of a man who meddles in everything he comes across, and who focuses on his fascinations in life, it currently being primarily horticulture. Upon his arrival at the 3rd Division, Harold has a new fascination, namely fingerprinting, he trying to get fingerprints for whoever he meets. Using this new fascination, the rank and file in the 3rd Division are able to send Harold on a wild goose chase in Chinatown, solely to get them out of his hair. But in doing so, they are unwittingly sending him into the middle of the activities of The Dragon. Harold ends up navigating through the mysteries of Chinatown with a sidekick, beat cop Patrick Clancy, who may be Harold's one admirer within the force. But rooting out The Dragon takes on special meaning for Harold when it affects him personally, namely in a boy named Buddy Lee no longer being able to undergo experimental treatment to repair his knee, which conventional western medicine cannot fix. Buddy came to San Francisco with a relative, a slightly scatterbrained young woman named Billie Lee, who Harold met while traveling to San Francisco, the two who fell in love despite their less than inauspicious first encounters.
