Pat Garrett is hired as a lawman on behalf of a group of wealthy New Mexico cattle barons to bring down his old friend Billy the Kid.
It's 1881 in New Mexico, and the times they are a'changing. Pat Garrett, erstwhile travelling companion of the outlaw Billy the Kid has become a sheriff, tasked by cattle interests with ridding the territory of Billy. After Billy escapes, Pat assembles a posse and chases him through the territory, culminating in a final confrontation at Fort Sumner, but is unaware of the full scope of the cattle interests' plans for the New West.
When Pat Garrett is about to become the local sheriff, he visits his old friend William Bonney, aka Billy the Kid, giving him one week to leave the area. When he fails to do so, he's arrested and will soon hang. Billy manages to escape however and Garrett sets off after him. The Governor and business interests make it clear that Billy is a hindrance and want him brought in. As they both travel the countryside a great deal of blood is spilled before they meet for one final time.
