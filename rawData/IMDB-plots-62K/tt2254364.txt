White teenager Jolie Jolson is trying to get on the high school basketball team, because Jolie thinks it will bring him one step closer to becoming the one thing that he is not: African-American.
Jolie is an avid hip-hop fan who romanticizes the tough backgrounds of rappers like Tupac Shakur, dreams of being a rich basketball star, in order to support his African American girlfriend, Henrietta, who is pregnant with another man's baby. He makes the team due to a large donation from his well-off father, and believes that he is one step closer to becoming the one thing that he is not: Black.
