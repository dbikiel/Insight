The unusual meeting between three deserters from different nationalities (Brazil, German and Italy) during World War II.
During World War II, looking up the Mountain, in Italy, a Brazilian Expeditionary Force - FEB - mines weeping platoon is hit by a panic-attack that sets them running aimlessly right in the middle of 'no man's land'. Desperate cold and hungry, the ill-prepared soldiers have to choose between facing military court or delve deeper into enemy lines. After a tense discussion, they decide to save their faces with the Brazilian Army by tackling a daring military objective: to disarm the most feared minefield in Italy. On their way there, they end meeting two others deserters; a remorseful Italian soldier trying to join the Partigianos and German officer who is just simply tired of war. with unexpected help of their ex-enemy, the soldiers are set to accomplish a mission that so far had been deemed impossible.
During the World War II, a small minesweeping and demining team from the Brazilian Expeditionary Force - BEF is in an outpost in Monte Castello. The group is not well prepared for combat and does not speak any foreign language; therefore they have difficulties to communicate with the American Army. Out of the blue, they have a panic attack and scatter on the mountain. Later, the soldiers Guimarães, Tenente, Piauí e Laurindo meet each other on the base of Monte Castello. They become afraid to go to their base of command and be considered deserters and ace court-martial; and also afraid to die if they return to their post. They stumble with the journalist Rui that tells that the important Road 47 is mined preventing the American force to proceed. They also stumble upon an Italian and a German deserters. They decide to demine the road to justify their retreat from the post.
