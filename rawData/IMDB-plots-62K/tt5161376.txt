After a girl goes missing, two of her friends and a mysterious set of strangers find themselves drawn to the cabin in the woods where she disappeared. They will laugh, they will drink, they will kiss, they will make love, and THEY MUST ALL DIE.
James, a new postman, has a special delivery for Kristy Jordan at a weathered cabin in the dense woods, somewhere in the middle of nowhere. However, she's nowhere to be found and the place seems deserted, apart from Kristy's best friends, Ashley and Lyndsey. As James and his friend try to make the best of a bad job--and maybe--have a good time with the girls, the definite presence of a mysterious entity in the thick moonlit forest brings chills down the spine. Could it be their disoriented friend, or is it something far more sinister lurking in the shadows?
