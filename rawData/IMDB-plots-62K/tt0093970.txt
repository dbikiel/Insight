A concert film with theatrical staging, featuring live performances by Prince and his band.
In front of a crowd at the Rotterdam Music Hall, Prince and his band perform 13 numbers, 11 of which are from his double album, "Sign 'o' the Times," and all but "Now's the Time" are his compositions. This is high energy stuff, with neon signs flashing above the stage, suggesting the honky-tonk district of a big city. Between a few of the numbers, there are vignettes of street life. Three women - Shiela E, Boni Boyer, and Cat - provide rhythmic, vocal, and physical pyrotechnics. Sheena Easton appears in a film within a film, her rock video "U Got the Look." In constant motion, never far from center stage, is Prince, Minnesota's charismatic pixy.
In reality, there is no plot to this movie. Not that it matters! There are events and a script, of sorts, but its only there as a backdrop to the performances, which are stellar. I got to see this in a small theater, which is a much better way to view it rather than a small TV screen. If you're going to view it at home, find someone with a BIG screen and a super sound system. It deserves to be turned up. We loved it and my friend went back to see it again the next night as well.
