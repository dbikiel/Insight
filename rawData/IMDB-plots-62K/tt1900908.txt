Jasna is a teenage girl living in the poor suburbs in the south of Belgrade, Serbia. She likes to record everything around her using a mobile phone camera. She is making videos of herself, her school friends, family and Djole - the boy of her dreams. Her family is a mess: father is terminally ill and mother is barely coping. That's why she is spending more and more time hanging out with her school friends, partying and drinking. At one of the parties, she finally starts a conversation with Djole and later they develop an intense sexual relationship. When he realizes that she will do anything to be close to him, Djole starts using her as a sexual object. Jasna starts to experiment with drugs and to skip school. Her life is getting out of control and she needs Djole to accept and reciprocate her affections.
Jasna is a beautiful girl in her mid-teens, leading a crude life of the postwar generation in Serbia. With a terminally ill father and dispirited mother, she is disillusioned and angry with everyone and everything, including herself. Having a huge crush on a boy from school, she goes on a spree of sex, drugs and partying, constantly filming with her mobile phone. Still, in that very harsh environment love and tenderness emerge.
