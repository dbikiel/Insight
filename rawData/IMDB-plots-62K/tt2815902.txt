A chronicle of the childhood of a post-World War I leader.
This chilling fable about the rise of fascism in the 20th Century tells the story of a young American boy living in France in 1918 whose father is working for the US government on the creation of the Treaty of Versailles. What he witnesses helps to mould his beliefs - and we witness the birth of a terrifying ego. Loosely inspired by the early childhood experiences of many of the great dictators of the 20th Century and infused with the same sense of dread as The Others and The Omen, The Childhood of a Leader is an ominous portrait of emerging evil.
In aid of the Versailles Treaty peace negotiations with the Germans in the aftermath of World War I, an American diplomat crosses the Atlantic to settle with his wife and his seven-year-old son in a dilapidated Parisian manor. Amidst a strict environment, boredom, an impenetrable adult realm, and endless tantrums, the petulant boy will test his strength in manipulation, and before long, innocence will yield to a far more sinister behaviour. Utterly unhappy in a vast house where peace seems to be the silent protagonist, little by little, the misshapen ideas of a still unformed young mind will eventually give birth to an inconspicuous leader. But who could spot the dictator in the making?
