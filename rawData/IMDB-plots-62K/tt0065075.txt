Tadeo is a taxi driver who is about to live a busy day of work. Throughout the day, heterogeneous characters get into his taxi, which give rise to the most varied situations. When one of them leaves a baby in the taxi, Tadeo will have to find out who he is, not forgetting that at the end of the day he has an appointment with a mysterious woman who, apparently, has to say something very important.
