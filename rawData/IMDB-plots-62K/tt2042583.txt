A road movie about teenage immigrants and their journey to the U.S.
Juan, Sara, and Samuel, three teenagers from the slums of Guatemala, travel to the United States in search of a better life. On their journey through Mexico, they meet Chauk, an Indian from Chiapas who doesn't speak Spanish. Traveling together in freight trains and walking on railroad tracks, they soon have to face an odyssey that will change their lives forever.
With dreams of a better life, three hopeless teenagers--the fiercely resolute, Juan; his friend, Samuel, and the admirably determined, Sara--set out on foot from the slums of their poor and miserable Guatemalan neighbourhood, for the Land of Opportunity. As the hopeful trio heads north, the silent Tzotzil Indian boy, Chauk, joins in the perilous journey to illegally cross the Mexican border into the United States of America. Facing arrest; violence; marauding gangs; La Migra, and even death, the foursome have to hop freight trains and keep a low profile to reach the promised land; however, what future awaits once they make it into the US?
