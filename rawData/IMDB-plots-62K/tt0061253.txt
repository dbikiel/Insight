The extended Forsyte family live a more than pleasant upper middle class life in Victorian and later Edwardian England. The two central characters are Soames Forsyte and his cousin Jolyon Forsyte. Soames is a solicitor, all proper and straight-laced. His love for the beautiful Irene is his only weakness as is his beautiful daughter Fleur. Young Jolyon is the opposite, a free-thinking artist who abandons his wife to live with his children's nanny. Their lives and their children's lives will intersect over 30 years bringing happiness to some and tragedy to others.
The Forsyte family is shown in Victorian respectability as they gather to meet June's fiance, the architect Philip Bosinney. Some years before her father Jolyon has scandalised the family by making her nanny his mistress. Jolyon's cousin Soames, an up and coming solicitor, has recently married the beautiful Irene and retains Bosinney to build a new home - "Robin Hill". Move ahead to the next generation. It's the 1920s. Soames's daughter Fleur (by the woman he marries after Irene leaves him) is madly in love with Jon,the son of Jolyon and his third wife Irene. Will Fleur find happiness as the wife of a well-connected publisher?
