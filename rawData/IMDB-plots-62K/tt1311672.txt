From the producers of SAW, VLOG is a groundbreaking extreme-horror film about a real-life webcam girl whose online murder is not what it seems.
Conceived as a series of video blogs, or vlogs, VLOG chronicles Brooke Marks, a sexy webcam girl who posts intimate details about her life to the 1.2 billion people on the internet. Her engaging personality, searing wit and hot body create an obsession in one diabolical fan, who posts his own video blogs in which he stalks and kills Brooke's friends in extremely gruesome ways. But the story of VLOG doesn't end there. Writer/Director Joshua Butler cast the part of Brooke Marks...with Brooke Marks. She was a real-life webcam girl who had a presence online for over 4 years. With tens of thousands of friends on social media sites, and millions of viewers on video sharing sites, she allowed Butler--in complete secrecy--to fictionalize her life. The film appeared as installments of her real-life video blog, setting up "friends" who would later become "victims" of the stalker-fan. Butler then set up the internet-killer's website for real and posted fractured snuff-video versions of VLOG's extreme-horror setpieces. Millions of viewers were watching VLOG and they didn't even know it. As the demon child of YouTube's Lonelygirl15 scandal and the Blair Witch hoax, VLOG is a wake-up call for the viral video generation, a cautionary tale that challenges the ideas of conventional narrative and online "reality." In its extended feature-film incarnation, it premiered as part of the Hollywood Film Festival at Arclight Cinemas, went on to play 18 more film festivals, won 4 awards, and is a 2010 theatrical release as part of the After Dark Horrorfest in Japan.
