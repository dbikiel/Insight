Doctor Vlimmen, the nearest Dutch equivalent to All Creatures Great and Small, is about the competent veterinarian of that name in the Dutch countryside, whose modern methods, liberal opinions and private life are considered scandalous by many of the conservative-Christian peasants. His socially more acceptable colleague Dr. Treeborg, who cares less for the animals and their rather poor owners, is thus more likely to be appointed at the public slaughterhouse and thus made untouchable, and both vets prepare legal action against each-other, thus involving Vlimmens only friend, a lawyer with whom he regularly visits Antwerp.
