Dostoevsky's "The Dream of a Ridiculous Man" tells the story of a desperate man disenchanted with the world and at the verge of committing suicide. But when a little girl comes his way asking for help, he changes his mind. Back at his home, he falls asleep and dreams about strange revealing things that somehow put everything into a new perspective. And then comes the questioning: the visions were just another dream or something real?
A lonely young man, whose environment from an early age considers him as a ridiculous eccentric, decides to shoot himself because of the idea that has settled in him. But conscience because of the vile deed done by him does not give a rest. In meditation, already with the revolver, the hero falls asleep. In a dream, he sees a world that looks exactly like Earth, but in which everything is perfect: there is no anger, envy, jealousy, theft. Earth was an ideal in everything. Gradually, the world in his eyes turns into the fallen world, as on Earth, and the hero of the story turns out to be the cause of this fall. The hero wakes up as a completely different person with the knowledge that it is better to sow love and goodness in the imperfect world than vice versa.
