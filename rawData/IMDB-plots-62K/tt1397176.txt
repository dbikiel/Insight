When a typical response to a supposedly simple noise complaint gets out of hand, two Police Officers will come face-to-face with the city's seedy underworld, determined to clear their names.
During a routine night patrol, police officer Bastien, his long-term partner Julie and the newcomer cop Simon are called out by a neighbor complaining of the noise in another apartment. Bastien knocks the door and out of the blue, the dweller opens the door and shoots him in the chest. Julie shoots the man who is high on drugs and apprehends a strange fluorescent yellow drug. They soon learn that the man is the son of a politician, and they are forced to sign a statement saying that the shooting was accidental. When the man recovers in the hospital, he sues the police officers and the police department does not support them. However, their chief tells them that they should find the trafficker that sold the drugs to the man. So Julie and Simon go undercover to the underworld of drugs.
A typical response to a supposedly simple noise complaint will get out of hand when a team of Police Constables lead by Officer Bastien will unexpectedly come face-to-face with the drug-crazed son of a French Member of the Parliament. However, with Bastien killed on duty and the remaining two Officers, Julie and Simon, accused of Police brutality and facing imminent suspension, there will be no other choice but to take matters into their own hands, determined to prove their innocence. Without delay, Julie and Simon will attempt to infiltrate deep into the city's seedy underworld, in search for the elusive drug ring which pushes on the streets the extremely potent and highly experimental new street drug known only as the "Sphinx". But the criminal network is well-organised and covert, while on the other hand, Julie and Simon are left abandoned by their colleagues..
