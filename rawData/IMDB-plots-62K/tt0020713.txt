A successful Broadway star ready to retire from her wild career announces her engagement. But her tumultuous past isn't done with her yet.
The lovely young star of a Broadway show is giving an interview to several newspaper writers and tells them about her wild life, parts of which involved "hula dancing" in Africa and an involvement with a dangerous Portuguese smuggler. Unbeknownst to her, the smuggler has showed up at the theater on that very night.
