They both live with their respective parents - Harry's mother who died about ten years ago, while his father is in ill health - and both work entry level blue collar jobs, Harry as a packing clerk for a china/glass company, it a job he is not very good at due not being very careful around the breakables, and Monika as a general clerk at a greengrocer. While Harry is at least committed to employment which he sees as a step to responsible adulthood, Monika wants to escape what she considers her terrible life, which includes getting away both from her parents and her job. Easily falling into helping Monika over all else, Harry decides to "escape" their respective lives with her.

Because of their age, they are both harassed at their respective places of work. Monika has an argument with her father and leaves her home; Harry has an argument with his boss and quits. Since they have nothing that ties them to the city, they take Harry's small boat to the archipelago to be alone for a few weeks.
