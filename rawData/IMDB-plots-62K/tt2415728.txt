Paul Taylor is one of the dance world's most elusive and respected choreographers. For over 50 years he has only given glimpses into his creative process, this film is an unprecedented exploration of how Mr. Taylor creates a single dance. The dominant voice is Paul's, between the guarded and unguarded moments we see him with new eyes and new understanding.
