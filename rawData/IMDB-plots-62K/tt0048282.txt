Donald is visiting South America, where he is first overcome by altitude sickness. He spends some time in the picturesque market. Then he take a llama up into the mountains, with exciting results.
Donald, the consummate tourist with camera in hand, visits Lake Titicaca, high in the Andes of Peru. With a running commentary by an off-screen narrator, Donald deals with altitude sickness, a trip on the lake in a balsa-wood boat, and a ride on a llama who responds to commands that are played on a flute. The ride across a swaying suspension bridge is the high point of Donald's vacation, just before he drops in on a pottery bazaar.
