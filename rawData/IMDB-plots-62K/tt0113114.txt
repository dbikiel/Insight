Teenager Jesse becomes reunited with Willy two years after the whale's jump to freedom as the teenager tries to rescue the killer whale and other orcas from an oil spill.
Willy the smart and rebellious whale and Jessie the orphaned boy team up to escape Willy's captivity and horrible owner to get back to his pod. Can they succeed with the help of Annie and Glenn Jessie's foster parents, Randolph the spiritual friend of Willy and Jessie, and Rae Willy's trainer?
Two years ago, 14-year-old teenager Jesse helped the whale Willy to jump into freedom. Jesse enjoys the life with his adoptive parents, when his half-brother Elvis arrives because of the death of their mother. During a camping trip Jesse meets Willy again, as well as his Indian friend Randolph. A tender love develops between Jesse and Rudolph's goddaughter Nadine. Suddenly a crashed oil tanker endangers the whales, and several animal and human lives have to be saved as well when the oil catches fire.
