From Michael McDowell, the writer of Beetlejuice (1988) and The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), comes a chilling tale of supernatural vengeance.
In a sleepy southern town, the Larkin family suffers a terrible tragedy. Now the Larkin's are about to endure another: Traffic lights blink an eerie warning, a ghostly visage prowls in the streets, and graves erupt from the local cemetery in an implacable march of terror . . . And beneath the murky surface of the river, a shifting, almost human shape slowly takes form to seek a terrible vengeance . . .
