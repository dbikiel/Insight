1967, one year before may '68. The strike at the Rhodiaceta textile plant in Besançon sounds like the rehearsal of the rising to come.

They first and foremost say no to the lifestyle capitalism wants to impose on them. One more year to go and the whole country of France will imitate the strikers of Besançon.
