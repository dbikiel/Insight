Criminal don-aspiring politician Shabbirbhai runs a collection agency in Mumbai's Bhendi Bazar called 'Good Luck Recovery'. He had started this business with 4 employees, but now has over 400 of them. His uses his influence and goon-power to mainly recover money from middle-classed clients of All India Bank. These include defaulters like Anil and his wife, Neha Sharma; Chandrakant and his son, Arjun Desai; DJ Ryan Breganza and his fickle girlfriend, Nancy; and Prerna Joshi, who all have borrowed huge amounts but are unable to return them. All four will soon realize that they are up against a lot more than just a regular collection agency, and their lives will soon be turned upside down.
