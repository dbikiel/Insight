The head of a Chinese martial arts school owes money to some local hoods, so he sends two of his students to Bangkok, Thailand to participate in a kickboxing tournament in order to raise the necessary money to pay off the debt. After one student gets injured and the other killed, the disgraced head of the school loses face with the Chinese Martial Arts Association and feels so ashamed that he commits suicide. It's up to the man's daughter and the injured student to not only avenge his death, but also to restore the honor of the school.
