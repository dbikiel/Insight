Have you ever fallen in love with your best friend? Jamie is moving in 2 weeks from Chicago to New York hoping to become a Broadway actress. Her best friend Jessica is bummed because she's not-so-secretly in love with Jamie. As moving day gets closer, Jessica tries to make Jamie jealous by dating other girls. But Jessica's plan backfires, in a way she could never imagine. "Jamie and Jessie Are Not Together" is about two women whose codependent, loyal friendship is fraught with erotic tension, and trying to figure out how to grow together or how to grow apart. A romantic comedy with Musical numbers, "Jamie and Jessie Are Not Together" is inspired by independent films like "Show Me Love", "500 Days of Summer" and "Lost in Translation". Set in working class Chicago and infused with dance numbers, "Jamie and Jessie are Not Together' is a love letter to those gray areas of love and lust and to the young romances we will never forget.
