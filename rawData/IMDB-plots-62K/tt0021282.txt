Woman inherits a traveling circus which brings financial difficulties.
After her father's death, Mary Rainey takes over the Rainey Circus (which operates twice daily, rain or shine) but runs into financial troubles. In one bit reminiscent of the Marx Brothers, the circus performers are up to some ridiculous antics at a dinner party with the family of Bud Conway, Mary's beau. As times become worse and the performers go on strike, Mary must try to save the circus from rioting patrons.
Adapted from a musical play, the film left out the musical numbers as a young girl tries to avert the bankruptcy of a circus. After the other performers go on strike, "Smiley" Johnson aids her in putting on a one-man show, while the Big Top burns.
