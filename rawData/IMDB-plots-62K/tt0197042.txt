A well-off grocery store owner and his outspoken right hand, who are head over heels in love with their neighbours, are about to have their ambitious plans crushed when the girls' true sweethearts put in an appearance at a joyous event.
Somewhere in Athens at a cramped but cosy grocery store, a kind but outspoken assistant, Zikos, and his well-off grizzled boss, Mr Pandelis, fall unexpectedly head over heels in love with their fresh and beautiful neighbours. In high hopes of finally settling down, both employer and employee will start making plans for a bright future; however, little do they know that their dear little darlings only have eyes for others. Soon, an ambitious plan and a big announcement of a joyous event will be blemished with the unforeseen and utterly disheartening appearance of the girls' true sweethearts; after all, love always finds its way.
This classic Greek comedy revolves around the constant fights between Zikos who works as a clerk at a small grocer's shop and the shop's owner. Zikos just can't keep his mouth shut every time his boss behaves as being an aristocrat. Things go even worse when Zikos finds out that his boss, by taking advantage of his wealth and with the help of the local match-maker, is planning to marry a young poor girl living in the same neighborhood.
