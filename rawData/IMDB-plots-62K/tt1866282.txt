On March 25, 1911, a catastrophic fire broke out at the Triangle Waist Company in New York City. Trapped inside the upper floors of a ten-story building, 146 workers - mostly young immigrant women and teenage girls - were burned alive or forced to jump to their deaths to escape an inferno that consumed the factory in just 18 minutes. It was the worst disaster at a workplace in New York State until 9/11. The tragedy changed the course of history, paving the way for government to represent working people, not just business, for the first time, and helped an emerging American middle class to live the American Dream.
This HBO documentary deals with the infamous fire of March 15, 1911 in New York City where 146 employees of the Triangle Waist Shirt Company, most of them women, were killed in a horrendous fire. The company operated on three upper floors in a relatively new high rise. This was a time however when there were no requirements for fire drills or sprinkler systems. The workers were packed into tight work spaces and when the fire broke out, one entire floor wasn't forewarned, thereby losing several precious minutes during which they could escape. In the end, dozens of workers jumped from windows to their death. The tragedy led to the creation of modern health and safety laws and laid the foundation for Roosevelt's New Deal.
