Ric Burns examines history of The National Enquirer and the life and gangland ties of its founder, Gene Pope. The film also tells of Mr Pope's upbringing in New York City with his newspaper publisher and political scion father, Generoso Pope. It's a fascinating portrait of a man driven to tell stories and sell papers.
