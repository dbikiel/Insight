The king locks up his daughter, Minnie, when she refuses to wed a dippy prince. Mickey Mouse, a wandering minstrel, comes to the rescue.
The princess (Minnie) is to wed the Prince (Goofy, still known as Dippy Dawg) against her wishes. When she refuses, her father the king locks her in the tower. Minstrel Mickey sees her and rescues her, making a rope from the clothes of lady-in-waiting Clarabell. The king spots them and prepares to chop off Mickey's head until Minnie intercedes. The king calls for a joust. Mickey wins, and they live happily ever after.
In the Ye Olden Days, the Ye Olde Kinge has arranged a marriage between his daughter, Ye Princess Minnie Mouse, and Ye Prince, who is little more than a dippy hayseed. Minnie refuses to marry this goofball. The infuriated king declares that she's a fanatic and (because everyone speaks in verse) locks her in the attic. Enter Mickey Mouse, Ye Wandering Minstrel. He helps her escape, but the king spots them in their act of treason and calls the guards to capture them. "Off with his head!" cries the king. The princess saves her 'lover-boy' by begging her father to let him and the prince duel for her maiden hand. The king agrees, giving Mickey and Minnie their chance at a happy ending.
