While trying to get his father out of a financial jam, a man comes up with an idea that turns into an unexpected overnight financial fashion success - the bottomless pants.
Jack Fine, owner/manager of Fine Fashions of Brooklyn, it which solely produces women's dresses, has been having a difficult time the past year due to the company not keeping up with the changing fashions. Associated, Jack is in debt to the tune of $1.5 million to loan shark and gangster, Mr. Eddie, a hulking and flamboyant man who has a penchant for picking up and destroying things which are bothering him, Jack who now falls into that category. Instead of proverbially or literally breaking Jack's legs or worse, Mr. Eddie decides to take over Fine Fashions until the debt is paid, with Jack's son, Bobby Fine, an English Literature professor at upstate Chippenango State College, to manage the operations. Not only does this new career, which Bobby has no option but to accept, threaten the possibility of Bobby obtaining this year's tenure track position in the department, but Bobby at the helm of the fashion house threatens to ruin it completely as Bobby has no idea about fashion whatsoever. Complicating matters is that Bobby and Mr. Eddie's wife, a seductive Italian named Lira, fall in love at first sight, she who doesn't love Mr. Eddie. Bobby's association with Lira accidentally leads to the latest fashion craze which could save Fine Fashions: coined "So Fine", they are jeans which expose the butt cheeks, that area of the pants covered with clear plastic. With Jack and Bobby potentially coming into a financial windfall because of So Fine as well as being the toast of the fashion world, the question becomes whether Bobby will get everything he wants, including the tenure position and Lira, without Mr. Eddie killing him.
