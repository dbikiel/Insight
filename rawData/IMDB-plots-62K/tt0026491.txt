A young man with money falls for singer Pat Thatcher, and her con man father makes the most of it.
Young would-be producer Doug Tyler meets singer Pat Thatcher twice, and makes the wrong impression both times. But Pat's father, the Commodore, easily cons Doug into mortaging his ancestral home to invest in a show. When the producers abscond with Doug's money, the show must close before it opens, unless one of the three can come up with a miracle.
