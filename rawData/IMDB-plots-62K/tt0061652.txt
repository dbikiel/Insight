The South is losing the Civil War and the coffers are nearly empty. A group of Confederate spies steals a shipment of gold in San Francisco and attempts to deliver it to a Confederate general in El Paso. Others know about the gold and seek to steal it from them, but the spies have a secret weapon: a guitar that shoots bullets....
Confederate super-spy Roy Orbison and his partner in crime Sammy Jackson travel to San Francisco near the end of the Civil War, masquerading, respectively, as a singer/guitar instructor and a magic-elixir vendor. Once there, Orbison dons a fake wig, beard, and mustache and steals Union gold to bring back to the South, aided by a guitar that doubles as a gun. The end of the Civil War tragically ruins their plan to hand over their ill-gotten loot to a Southern general.
