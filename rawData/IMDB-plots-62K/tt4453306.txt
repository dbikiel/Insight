Security team 'Safety First' accepts its biggest challenge so far: guarding the famous electronic music festival Tomorrowland.
"Safety First" is a hilarious work place mockumentary set at the heart of a security company. Discipline, dedication and friendship, that's what work is about. Oh, and falling over, making a mess, accidentally making a total fool of yourself and then picking yourself up to get back in the game.
