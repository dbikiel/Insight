When bank teller and widower with seven kids Henry Dimsdale (Bob Hope) finds $10,000 in a parking lot, he's in a dilemma whether to turn it over or keep it for his financially strapped family. After a time, his bank discovers a substantial money shortage in their books and begins to suspect Henry. Tipped off, Henry takes his large brood on the lam to avoid arrest while his children's flamboyant baby-sitter, Golda (Phyllis Diller), shields them from her new but dim-witted boyfriend, Det.
