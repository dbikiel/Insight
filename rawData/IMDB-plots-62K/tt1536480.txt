The remarkable story of an African fig tree and the special relationship it has with the animals who depend on it.
The fig tree and fig wasp differ in size a billion times over, but neither could exist without the other. Their extraordinary relationship is a pinnacle of co-evolution, and the basis of a complex web of dependency that supports animals from ants to elephants. Each individual fig is a microcosm - a stage set for birth, sex and death as the tiny players battle against predators and parasites to fulfill their mission. It is one of the most amazing stories in the natural world - a tale of intrigue and drama, set against grand Africa and it's wildlife.
