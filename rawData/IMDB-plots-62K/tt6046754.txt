The new ensemble romantic comedy written and directed by Ben Elton.
Set over three summers at The Westival, a fictional West Australian rural folk festival redoubtable local radio personality 'Queenie' describes as "Australia in a tent". Two young musicians fall in love against a wider collection of tales dealing with a microcosm of contemporary discussion points, including Indigenous, immigration and refugee issues.
