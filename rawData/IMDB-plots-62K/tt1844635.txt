A group of friends get together for a 25th birthday party at a remote house in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. After someone goes missing and the police search the premises to no avail, the remaining party goers are left to wait until morning. With virtually no cell phone reception and no land line, the situation escalates when one frantic friend takes matters into his own hands and ventures off in the woods to find his girlfriend. What they don't know is that someone or some thing is hunting them one by one.
