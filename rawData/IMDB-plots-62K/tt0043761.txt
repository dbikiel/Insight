Gas station owner Donald thinks he's just missed the winning number for a new Zoom V8 car but his nephews hear a correction, and find he really does have the winner. They plan to pick it up and surprise him, but the car they take runs out of gas, and they're broke. They cut out the picture of a Zoom V8 from a billboard, dress one of the boys in drag, and trick Donald into filling their tank. As they drive off, Donald plots his revenge and executes it, when the boys return in Donald's new car.
Donald Duck is a service station owner, awaiting with his nephews a raffle over the radio for the new Zoom V-8. When the numbers are announced as '3-4-1,' Donald angrily throws down his ticket and storms off (he was one digit off). However, once out of the room, the announcer mentions that there was a mistake, and it seems that Donald's ticket did have the winning number. One of the nephews decides to tell Donald, but another feels it'd be more fun to pick up the car and surprise him. However, with only 10 minutes to present the winning ticket, the nephews try to get down to the car showroom, but find their jalopy is out of gas.Using a Zoom V-8 cutout from a nearby billboard and dressing up one of the nephews as an attractive girl, they get Donald to fuel up the jalopy and take off. Donald is of course enraged at this deception. Shortly thereafter, he received a phone call from a man who tells him that his nephews 'have a big surprise for him,' and to be ready. Donald then hatches a plan of his own.When the boys arrive in the newly-won Zoom V-8, Donald assumes they are there to prank him again, and then proceeds to wreck the new vehicle by pouring oil on it, over-inflating the tires, and smashing it flat. It's only after he has destroyed the car does he hear a radio announcement saying that he was the winner of the contest. Mortified at what he has done, Donald collapses in shock.
