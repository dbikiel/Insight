The movie is made of interviews with people (mainly young) working in Atesia, a large call center in Rome, and telling their direct experiences: low salaries, few rights, protests and strikes, people fired, government promises and so on. In addition, there is one monologue of Ascanio Celestini (the director, who is a theater's actor specialized in monologues), partly surrealistic and partly extremely present-day.
