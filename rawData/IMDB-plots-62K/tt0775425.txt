In this animated follow-up to Fairytopia, Elina (played by Barbie) enlists the help of a mermaid, Nori, to save her friend Nalu, a merman prince who has been captured by the wicked Laverna.
After defeating the Enchantress' evil sister, Laverna, in Barbie: Fairytopia (2005), Elina, the wingless but brave flower-fairy, receives a precious set of sparkling wings. Before long, Elina will put her newly acquired powers to the test, when Laverna's subordinates abduct Nalu--the young Prince of the Merfolk--threatening to pollute the sea unless he accepts to disclose the exact location of the magical Immunity Berry. Now, with the help of her pet-friend, Bibble, and the reluctant mermaid, Nori, Elina must summon up the courage to find the imprisoned merman, and save the peaceful Fairytopia from the clutches of the wicked Laverna. Can they make it in time?
