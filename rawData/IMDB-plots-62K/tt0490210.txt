When Anita Rajan, CEO of Sheppard power plant, an international Company, brings a power plant proposal to set up in rural Maharashtra before the Nagres, insightful Shankar is quick to realize the benefits the power plant can bring to the people. After convincing Sarkar who is against it for various reasons, Shankar undertakes a journey along with Anita to the villages of Maharashtra to mobilize support from the masses. However, things are not what they seem to be and Shankar's dream project gradually becomes a political minefield. It is in this backdrop the evil forces mightier than ever, mushroom and gang up to bring down the regime of Sarkar and obliterate Shankar's name from the political horizon.
Maharashtra's most powerful and influential family consists of Subhash Nagre; his wife, Pushpa; two sons: Vishnu and Shankar; and Shankar's wife, Avantika. The family face inner conflict when Vishnu departs, never to return. Then, when U.K.-based Anita Rajan approaches them for assistance for opening a power plant in Thakurwadi, Subhash initially opposes it as it could displace the local residents. He subsequently relents after Shankar persuades him. The duo travel to meet with Rao Saab, who welcomes them, but cautions them that they may face opposition from Sanjay Somji. Shankar starts to make presentations, and Sanjay virulently opposes them, leading to riots in the region. The Nagres then find their lives shattered when a pregnant Avantika is killed in a bomb explosion and Subhash suffers a stroke. Will these catastrophes compel them to move away from public life?
