This story is about three slacker friends: Marat (a video store worker); Belyj (an unsuccessful actor); and Nick (a cowardly marshal arts practitioner). Bored with their lives and wanting to instead live in style, the boys rob the richest and most respected men in the city. However, they are in over their heads and it is too late to turn back.
