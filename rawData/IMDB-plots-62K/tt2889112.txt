When a young man with mental health issues becomes intimate with a suicidal flight attendant, his obsessive mother enlists a dysfunctional cop to separate them.
Patrick is a warm, open, twenty-six year old virgin schizophrenic. Pills and his mother's protection means Patrick is no threat to himself or others. Until he falls in love. Maura is Patrick's obsessive mother and her need to control her son blinds her to the reality that sometimes the only thing more damaging than hate is misguided love. Soon to be redundant, alcoholic air-hostess, Karen, books into an hotel to end her life unaware that the intimacy she shares with Patrick will reintroduce her to living. Dysfunctional loner cop, Freeman, wants to be a stand-up comic, but, when Maura loses her son, Freeman will use his position to help her find him, for a price. A provocative love story about the right to intimacy for everyone Patrick's Day suggests, when it comes to love, we're all a little crazy.
