Barbara Hoffman is a University of Wisconsin science student. She is a part-time employee at a local massage parlor. She is also a killer. Now all Detective Lulling has to do is prove it.
The true story of the first televised murder trial in U.S. history, Winter of Frozen Dreams reveals the bizarre tale of a brilliant biochemistry student who lead a shocking double life. Barbara Hoffman (Thora Birch) was a top student at the University of Wisconsin, and one of Madison's most notorious prostitutes. But how could a girl known for her remarkable mind be drawn into such a lurid plot of passion and murder? When Barbara's fianc√© Jerry Davies (Brenden Sexton III) reported the discovery of a corpse one frigid Christmas morning, he never thought police would suspect him of being the killer. Just hours before, Jerry had buried the body in a snow bank, and now Detective Lulling (Keith Carradine) smells foul play. Insisting that he and Hoffman didn't kill the deceased but merely buried the man's corpse, Davies and his bride-to-be quickly establish themselves as the prime suspects in a perplexing murder case. Later, as Hoffman languishes in prison, she becomes an object of curiosity in the media for her refusal to give interviews or even go before the parole board. [D-Man2010]
