A Reykjavik pre-school teacher struggles to raise her daughter while selling casual sex to help make ends meet.
Three tales of three people who have a lasting effect on one another. A young writer whose career is skyrocketing finds himself in a stormy marriage. He divorces his wife after the death of their daughter, shuts himself from the outside world and drinks himself to death over a twenty-year period.
Follows three very different people who's lives become intertwined and affect each other in ways unforeseen. A kind-hearted young mother struggling to stay afloat has chosen a dark and demeaning career to support her daughter, a seemingly worthless trap drinks to escape a horrible past he wants to forget and a success driven business man deals with the morality of corporate fraud. They must accept their past and present choices to help themselves and the people around them.
