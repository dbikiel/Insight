Michael Gewa is a devoted German high school teacher, ready to go the extra mile for his pupils, even understanding for troublesome louts. He sees no reason to react when a novel Internet company offers him a 'premium subscription' to clean up his rating on their website. But school colleagues, pupils and their parents soon get wind of his bad rating and various posts leading to it. He plans to fight back, focusing more on the 'fake news', considering his job less crucial. But the next strike compromises his relationship with his steady girl friend.
