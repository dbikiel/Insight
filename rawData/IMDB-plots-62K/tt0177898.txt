Femme fatal/con artist Bridget Gregory travels to Barcelona and targets another businessman to scam him of his money while a relentless private investigator tries to track her down.
In a continuation of the previous movie, Bridget Gregory, having successfully killed her husband and framed Mike Swale for it, flees to Barcelona, Spain to avoid an investigation into the case. Here she meets Troy Fenton who runs a phone sex line and soon lets Bridget in on his secret operation where she begins another devious plan of stealing Troy's profits for herself and depositing them in a local bank account with a little help from an old business friend, named Simon, in London. Meanwhile, Mike's father hires Murphy, a professional private investigator, to find Bridget and bring her back to New York to face a possible indictment for her part in her husband's murder. But when Bridget learns that someone is following her trail, she begins to set a trap for all the parties involved.
