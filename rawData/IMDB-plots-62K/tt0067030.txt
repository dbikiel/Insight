"A collection of skits, parodies, musical performances, and film clips supposedly relating to the peace movement of the late Sixties and early Seventies" - fair enough but adding my 10 cents worth as I sit here watching it today. This movie never boasted to be about peace reforms. As soon as I saw it without reading any reviews, this movie is brilliant piece of work ahead of its times about the social changes that were happening in astounding leaps and contrasts in different parts of the world - ultimately impacting how social etiquette changed for the better or worse .. nonetheless changed. it is delivered in an artistic form that I feel, would be appreciated in today's more "arty" atmosphere. I see this as one of the earliest efforts I have seen at throwing things in our face showing us not everything is "oh dear you have worked hard, let me fluff your pillow, hand you a bear while I carve the meat and mash for you" and much more.
A collection of skits, parodies, musical performances, and film clips supposedly relating to the peace movement of the late Sixties and early Seventies , but more a general patchwork than a purposeful collection.
