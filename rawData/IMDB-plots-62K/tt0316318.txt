Upset by rumors that Halloween may end, Dracula calls his mild-mannered monsters together and delivers an ultimatum - either regain their frightening image, or leave his Transylvania castle forever.
On Halloween night, Count Dracula summons all the classic horror monsters to demand that they either revamp themselves into the horrible, scary creatures they are supposed to be, or get out of his castle. Definite disco-culture influence here. Judd Hirsch looks like a Saturday Night Fever throwback. Fun for children!
