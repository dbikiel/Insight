In the closing stages of the 21st Century, an enigmatic warrior, called the Baron, leads the crusade that the religious organization Exorcio Deus Machine is conducting against the forces of Evil. During an extermination mission, the Baron is taken prisoner by the evil sorceress Lady Pervertvm and is tortured until she gets his seed. Lady Pervertvm uses the Baron's seminal fluid to fertilize the Beast-Ragnarok in order to have it engender the most powerful and ultimate race of demons. The Baron manages to escape but, blinded by his guilt, he begins a bloody Via Crucis which will start to reveal his true nature.
