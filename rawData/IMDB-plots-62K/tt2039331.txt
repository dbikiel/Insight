Dino is forty years old and an immense love for Anna, who is unable to touch and consume in an embrace. Anesthetist by day, compulsive lover at night, seeking satisfaction with prostitutes and swingers. The early death of his brother and mother left him deeply marked and lead to sexual addiction. Rejected the loving care and the gentle advances of Anna, Dino recovers and meets the former partner's, asking them to get back with her or appagarne the pleasure he denies. Dismissed or looked with compassion, the man asks Anna to find a passionate lover. Anna, first reluctant, he ends up giving, while doing a night of sex with a stranger. But the feeling he has for Dino is more powerful than any physical pleasure and frustration. Return home but maybe for her and Dino is really too late to start.
