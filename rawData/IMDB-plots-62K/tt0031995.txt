Shirley is the orphaned survivor of an Indian attack in the Canadian West. A Mountie and his girlfriend take her in. Everybody suffers further Indian attacks and the Mountie is saved from the stake only by Shirley's intervention with the Indian chief.
While on patrol, Insp. Montague (Monty) of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and his group find a girl, Susannah, orphaned in an Indian attack. They bring her back to their fort. Monty meets &amp; falls for Vicky, the daughter of the fort superintendent. The fort deals with more attacks while trying to broker a deal with the chief of the local tribe. He leaves his son, Little Chief, as his token of good faith that he will find the ones responsible for the attacks and theft of horses from the railroad company.
