Two screenwriters in a rut come up with a story idea starring a bankable cowboy and the baby of the studio's waitress.
A Hollywood film studio in receivership and courted by a British outfit has all the signs of being run as a madhouse by Elliot Friday. To complete the image, screenwriters Law and Benson pretty well run rampant over the lot. When canteen-girl Susie is found to be pregnant they hatch the idea of making her expected baby a new star. Owner B.K. starts to realise this is no way to run a railroad.
