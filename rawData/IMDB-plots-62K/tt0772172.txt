Danielle, a young psychology student, is trying to rebuild her life when she sublets a century-old Victorian house. Unknowingly, she awakens an evil specter lurking in the dark recesses of her new home. To prove to her sister, Anna, that she isn't delusional again, Danielle sets out to document the haunting with horrifying results. She unleashes the soul of Edgar Crowe, a vicious child killer, who quickly seizes control of her life. Hungry to satisfy his taste for torturing boys, Crowe uses Danielle like a pawn to resurrect his ghastly "Panic Chair." Now, Anna faces an impossible task - destroy Crowe without destroying her sister. The solution comes to Anna, but is it buried too deeply in the long dead past for her to reach?
Danielle Velayo (Alanna Chisholm), a beautiful psychology student, is not only haunted by a troubled past, but becomes possessed by the sinister soul of a child killer. She fears her paranoid freak-out may recur, but also is afraid her anti-psychotic prescription may be making her fat. As the story begins, Danielle is moving into a creepy three-story house as the sole sub-letter. Sensing a ghostly presence, the idea of moving out never crosses her mind. Instead, she wonders how she can exploit several paranormal events to further her academic career. Whenever things "go bump in the night," Danielle persuades her buxom dental hygienist sister Anna (Lauren Roy) to share her bed. Meanwhile, the house begins to yield clues to its past through sinister sprockets, hidden rooms, and musical chairs. Anna involves Danielle's ex-boyfriend Ryan "Nemo" Durbin (Paul Soren), who lives on a boat "with no bathroom." Danielle's professor turns out to have a big secret of his own. Jacob (Nicholas Tortolano), Danielle's cute little neighbor boy, asks her to repair his sprocket. She introduces him to the joys of origami. In the fight of her life, Danielle must confront the evil lurking within her, or die trying.
