Quebec City, 1956. Nelly Maloye, an ebullient novice detective, accidentally crosses paths with Simon Picard, an ambitious research assistant in anthropology at the local university. Backed by a glory-seeking philanthropist, the intuitive but disorganized Nelly and the methodical, obsessive Simon set off on a wild adventure, determined to prove the existence of the Abominable Snowman. To achieve this goal, Simon relies on the coded diary of a missing explorer - a diary that should lead them to the mythic creature's lair. Accompanied by Tenzig Gombu, a clever and enigmatic young Sherpa guide, and Jazzmin, a talkative myna bird, our heroes confront a host of dangers in the heart of the Himalayas as they seek that legendary beast: the Yeti.
