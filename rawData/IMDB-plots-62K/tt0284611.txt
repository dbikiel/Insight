When Archibald Asparagus takes over VeggieTales, he does this episode in a classy way. The "Silly Song with Larry" involves takes place in the thirties, with Larry trying to protect his top hat from being squashed, and singing in Sinatra-like tunes. The episode's entire story is supposedly a lost Gilbert and Sullivan musical, which Archibald learns at the end was just a prank script. It involves a friendly young viking who continually leaves the ship with some money and returns with an empty bag. When two other vikings are sent to find out what's going on, they learn he is returning what they stole to the monks. But should they tell their superior, if it'll get Lyle executed?
