Quincy Jones was an aspiring L.A. stand-up comic, working the requisite barista job while at one point meeting a goal of doing 1,000 gigs in one year. He was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2015. He's undergoing chemotherapy and has a year to live, say doctors. A pair of comic friends (Nicole Blaine and her husband, Burning The Light director Mickey Blaine), knowing that Jones' final wish was to have his own hour-long stand-up special, set up a Kickstarter to raise the estimated $5,000 budget. After the story was picked up by Ellen DeGeneres on her talk show, they raised 10 times that amount. DeGeneres helped Jones' special, Burning The Light, secure a spot on HBO. The widely seen clip of him getting the news is here, in case you want a good cry.
