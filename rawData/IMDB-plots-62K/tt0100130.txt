A sci-fi fantasy about a world where it is illegal to enjoy any kind of media except in a place called Megaville. After catching a brutal killer named Jenson, the media police send an agent, Palinov, to infiltrate Jenson's circle of criminals in Megaville because Palinov bears a striking resemblance to Jenson. Palinov, however, begins to suffer intense headaches and has visions of the killings. His mission becomes even more confusing when the president of Megaville is assassinated and the media police seem more interested in doing business with the criminals than catching them.
Billy Zane is Mr. Palinove, a grunt cop in the totalitarian government's Media Police, who confiscate illegal television programming. Meanwhile, he has begun suffering from delusional seizures, apparently induced by exposure to media. These may be caused by an implant that has been secretly put into his brain. He's offered a post to the elite CKS corps, so as to masquerade as a sadistic smuggler and infiltrate their organization in Megaville. Once in Megaville, his seizures become more vivid, and he suspects that the horrifying memories of the smuggler have been downloaded to his mind. His mission is revised to make a deal to import the outlawed VR drug Dream-A-Life. It becomes clear that he is not Palinov disguised as the smuggler, but the smuggler with Palinov's personality overlayed upon his own personality with a version of Dream-A-Life. Torn between external alliances and internal morality, he strikes back that the agency that used him.
