Blue Wild Angel: Jimi Hendrix Live At The Isle Of Wight documents the guitarist's legendary performance before 600,000 people at this massive outdoor music and arts festival in August 1970. This unforgettable concert film experience draws heavily upon Academy Award winning Director Murray Lerner's vast archive of previously unseen performance footage and presents some of Hendrix's finest ever concert performances, including extended takes of "Machine Gun," "Red House," and other favorites such as "All Along The Watchtower," "Voodoo Child (Slight Return)," and a unique medley of "God Save The Queen" and "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band." New interviews with Jimi Hendrix Experience band members Mitch Mitchell, Billy Cox, and others set the stage for the concert footage that follows.
