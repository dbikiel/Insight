A man tries passing off a socially awkward fellow as a Casanova in the hopes of marrying off his would be sister-in-law.
Jeff wants to get married to Virginia, but Virginia won't marry until her older, hard-to-please sister Angelica gets married off first. Jeff pretends that a shy, never-married nobody he has just met is really a great lover, in order to get Angelica interested in him.
