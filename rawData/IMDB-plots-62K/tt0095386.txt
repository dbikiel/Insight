A successful entrepreneur in his fifties decides to abandon his loved ones and the empire he has built to find the liberty he yearns for, unaware that the itinerary of one's life often changes in the funniest of ways.
On a cloudy day in a small-town carnival, an unattended three-year-old boy with a small note in his hand cries inconsolably. As the years pass by, the same boy will start a career as an intrepid trapeze acrobat--and before long--he will reach the peak by being the biggest in his trade. Accomplished, with kids, wealth, and recognition, the man will quit the firm and his current lifestyle to set off on a solitary voyage of self-awareness in the vast landscapes of Africa, never to return. There, the most improbable friendship will start--and after two years of being presumed dead--a spark will rekindle, making him realise, that even if one has done and seen it all, he can be surprised by what life still has to offer.
