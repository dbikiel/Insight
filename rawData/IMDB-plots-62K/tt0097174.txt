The third thrilling saga of Deathstalker pits him against the evil wizard and ruler of the Southland, Troxartes, and his band of undead warriors. Dashing Deathstalker is entrusted by the beautiful Princess Carissa to protect an enchanted Jewel one of three which together hold the key to the lost city of treasure, Erendor. The missing pair of gems are stashed all too safely in the heavily guarded castle of the wicked Troxartes. His mission clear, Deathstalker rouses his troops and storms the fortress with the power of lightning. And in this fateful battle, one man will survive to witness the magical secrets of Erendor.
Legend has it that, if the three lost fragments of a mystical gem become one, the bearer will unlock the fabled city of immense riches, Erendor. After restoring Princess Evie to the throne in Deathstalker II (1987), the fearless master of the blade, Deathstalker, crosses paths with the beautiful blue blood, Carissa, and her brave sister, Elizena--and together--along with the wild female-warrior, Marinda, embark on a hazardous quest to recover the jewels. However, the all-powerful warlock, Troxartes, too, is seeking the magical stones, intent on harnessing the enchanted gem's unlimited force. Once again, Deathstalker has bitten off more than he can chew. Can he stop the wizard's invincible warriors from Hell?
