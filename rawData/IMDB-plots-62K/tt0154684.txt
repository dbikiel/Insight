Footage of Johnny Cash at home and on the road.
A fly-on-the-wall account that follows the legendary singer on tour in the USA during the late sixties. Crammed with superb music footage, the film also takes time out to relax with the man behind the most famous voice in country music. Whether visiting family or friends, winding down backstage or on a solitary hunting expedition, Johnny Cash always finds a song to fit the occasion.Alongside live performances of great hits like "Ring Of Fire," "Folsom Prison Blues," and "Big River," there are classic duets with his wife, June Carter plus rock 'n' roll stars Carl Perkins and Bob Dylan. From receiving his award for the "Folsom Prison" album at the 2nd ever Country Music Awards in Nashville to waxing philosophical on the tour bus; from playing in front of hardened criminals to backstage, arranging record company auditions for budding songwriters, "Johnny Cash: The Man, His World, His Music" stands as confirmation of the artist's status as one of the greatest singer-songwriters of all time.
