Musa, who works as a bookkeeper in the customs office, believes in the emptiness and absurdity of life. He doesn't struggle to change his life; he lets himself flow along with events because he thinks that it all leads to the same end. The death of his mother doesn't affect him. Although he loves her, her death makes him joyful. In order to avoid making any decisions he marries a girl whom he doesn't like, because she wants it. Whereas in his world, people deal with their fate by their own will and power. Musa is arrested for the death of a mother and her two kids. However, he doesn't react to this event either...
Musa's mother dies, yet he acts unaffected. When a coworker, a woman for whom Musa has no passion, asks to marry him, he agrees with his shoulders shrugged. But when Musa is tried and found guilty of a crime that he did not commit, his passivity and fatalism are taken to truly absurd levels.
