The Caldwell family returns. With everyone coming home and no school restrictions, Oliver takes the oppurtunity to suprise the family with a vacation to Puerto Rico.
Alex graduates as valedictorian in glorious rascally style, but during the stunt one last time chases a babysitting au pair, now for Sara. So his stepmother Jenny must do it herself again on Oliver's tropical surprise vacation, with some help from Katie, who is allowed to bring along her study buddy Ariana, to Alexa's taste when they arrive in a Puertorican villa managed by Nigel's brother Rupert. While the girls swoon over local rental bikes entrepreneur Danny, jealous Katie sabotages Alex's buddy romance with Ari, which proves more painful for all of them then dodging the clueless bodyguards. Oliver meanwhile can't escape from the threat posed to his company's future, a water motor, a legacy for Alex incompatible with the heir's artistic ambitions, posed by executive rival Walter Hausen at board level.
The Caldwells take a family trip to Puerto Rico where their father is also securing a secret business deal, while the kids find their own paths.Eight years have passed since the events of Au Pair, and newly graduated as his high school's valedictorian, Alexander Caldwell joins his visiting sister, college freshman Katie and her roommate Ariana on a family summer vacation with father Oliver and stepmother Jenny. Oliver and Jenny's current nanny declines to join them and the over-worked parents/executives must take care of their newborn baby Sarah in Puerto Rico.
Amidst corporate scheming by the young company CFO Walter Hausen, who is planning a takeover of Oliver's company CCI Tekhausen (formed in Au Pair II), Oliver and Jenny must contend with bridging the generation gap with the family, new career motivations and the romances of their 'newly reformed' prankster kids.
