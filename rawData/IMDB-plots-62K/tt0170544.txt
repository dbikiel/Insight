A noble young samurai searches for a thief who has stolen a precious treasure and killed one of his clansmen and meets an older samurai who tries to deter him from the violence of revenge.
Three centuries ago, a precious sword has been stolen by Kazamatsuri -- the sword, which historic and symbolic value is priceless for the clan (Shogun Tokugawa donated it to clan 80 years before that, at the same time that he established them as the local rulers). Lord's counselor's young son Heishiro goes to retrieve the sword himself to protect the clan from the shame or possible demise. He is accompanied with two friends, Shintaro and Tadasuke, and followed by the ninjas of the clan. After Kazamatsuri wounds Heishiro and kills one of his friends, the young aristocrat still wants revenge more than sword itself, but meanwhile have to recover from his wounds, in the small forest house of a lonely samurai and his daughter. At the same time, Kamazatsuri stays in nearby town in the entertainment center run by Okatsu and falls into her. The older samurai tries to dissuade Heishiro from fighting with Kamazatsuri, but is himself gradually drawn into the conflict.
Kanzen Unikai earns his clan's great honor: proprietorship of a revered sword, a gift from the shogun. Shintaro and Tadasuke now chase across Japan to retrieve the object, fired up by the resolve of stern Heishiro. The Three Stooges-like team meet with early misfortune and realize that Unikai isn't a man to be trifled with, even he obscure about his motives. Meanwhile, the clan lord is overcome with pressure to quiet things up, at least until there's a solution; but as long as Unikai holds the cards, they're at wits end to beat this unbeatable swordsman. Until an unconventional possibility emerges....
