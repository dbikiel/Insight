In sunny St. Tropez, a young sexpot loves one brother but marries the other.
Antoine promises to take the orphaned Juliette away from St. Tropez after a party where she has wandered onto the yacht of the urbane Eric. But in the morning the bus and Antoine zip by Juliette's stop and she runs into the field to capture the rabbit she set free moments before. About to be sent back to the orphanage by her foster mother, she identifies with the rabbit. Antoine's younger brother Michel comes to Juliette's rescue with a marriage proposal and she accepts. Eric wants the brothers' shipyard as a casino site and brings Antoine back to St. Tropez. Life gets complicated.
In St. Tropez, the orphan Juliete Hardy is an eighteen years old woman sexually active and ahead of time, strongly desired by the wealthy middle age man Eric Carradine. She has a crush on Antoine Tardieu, the older son that works in Toulon of a poor family that owns a modest shipyard, but he just want to have one nightstand with her. When Juliete's stepparents decide to send her back to the orphanage because of her bad reputation in the town, Antoine's brother Michel Tardieu proposes to marry her and she accepts, and she begins to love him. But when the Tardieu family decides to sell the shipyard to Eric and Antoine returns to St. Tropez, her lust for him blossoms again and becomes an announced tragedy.
Juliette Hardy is sexual dynamite, and has the men of a French coastal town panting. But Antoine, the only man who affects her likewise, wouldn't dream of settling down with a woman his friends consider the town tramp. While Antoine's away, his younger brother Michel, who worships Juliette, proposes to her; out of liking rather than love, she accepts, and their marriage becomes happy. But what will happen when Antoine returns?
