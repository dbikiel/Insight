The classic story of Robinson Crusoe, a man who is dragged to a desert island after a shipwreck
On 30 September 1659, the aristocratic British Robinson Crusoe's ship sinks and he miraculously survives on a deserted island somewhere in South America. He retrieves a dog, Rex, and cat, Sam, from the shipwreck together with some supplies, weapons, clothes and tools and builds a shelter. He soon learns how to survive by cooking, farming, harvesting the crops. Then the loneliness begins to haunt him, especially after the loss of Rex. When he sees a group of cannibals in the island, tension and fear become part of his life. Later he saves the life of a savage that was going to be eaten by the cannibals; he names him Friday and they become friends. When Robinson Crusoe sees Caucasians on the island, he finds that Captain Oberzo was the victim of a mutiny and he helps him to retrieve his ship.
In the late seventeenth century, Englishman Robinson Crusoe, against the advice of his father but craving adventure, decides to sail from England to Africa to pick up slaves to work on their Brazilian plantations. Hitting a storm along the way, he gets shipwrecked on a deserted tropical island somewhere in the Atlantic. The only known survivors are himself and the ship's two mascots, a cat named Sam and a dog named Rex. Crusoe manages to bring on shore some supplies from the wrecked ship before it sinks for good. Despite being from the privileged class, Crusoe is determined to eke out a life for himself on the island while he waits for a passing ship to rescue him, that is if he doesn't die from the sheer torture of isolation first. As he waits and waits and waits, he learns that not all passersby may be friendly, but that some can be rehabilitated to the proper English way.
