Do you like blood; gore? Are you into cutting; slashing? Is cannibalism more your speed? Or maybe monsters; evil children get you going? Whatever your ghoulish pleasure, we have a tale for you. In the tradition of Creepshow; Tales from the Crypt, DRIVE-IN HORRORSHOW features five terrifying tales of horror.
In a post-apocalyptic, lifeless world you are cordially invited into an old abandoned, rather derelict, drive-in movie theatre to view a selection of five short films, each telling a story using a cast of creative, but monstrous characters who run the drive-in. Each night The Projectionist and his loyal servant, Billy Troll serve up a variety of horror movies for their ghoulish guests. Be warned: Expect to see skeletons aplenty and even murder victims, some with axes buried deep in their backs. Dire consequences await the viewer. Enter at your peril!!!
