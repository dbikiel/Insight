A young dancer finds her own way to shine.
Nine-year-old Isabelle is an inspired dancer with a flair for fashion design. She's thrilled to be studying ballet at a prestigious performing arts school, but her classmates are so talented - and she can't help feeling that she's always in the shadow of her "perfect" older sister, Jade. So when her idol, a famous ballerina, encourages her to audition for a professional ballet, Isabelle isn't sure she can land the role. And when a competitive classmate starts pointing out Isabelle's every mistake, her confidence sinks even further. Can she find the courage to step into the spotlight and discover her own way to shine?
