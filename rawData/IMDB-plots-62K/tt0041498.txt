After marrying an American lieutenant with whom he was assigned to work in post-war Germany, a French captain attempts to find a way to accompany her back to the States under the terms of the War Bride Act.
Captain Henri Rochard of France is assigned to work with First Lieutenant Catherine Gates of the U. S. Army. Through a wacky series of misadventures, they fall in love and marry. When the war ends, Rochard tries to return to America like female war brides could under the auspices of America's 1945 War Brides Act. Zany gender-confusing antics follow.
Captain Henri Rochard of the French army, and Lieutenant Catherine Gates, of the American, are assigned a mission together to stop a high-level German scientist in postwar Germany. They start out thinking they hate each other, but end up falling in love. They encounter various bureaucratic hassles trying to get married. When Catherine's army unit gets recalled to the United States, the only way they have to stay together is by invoking a law allowing the spouse of American army personnel to enter the country - the War Brides act.
