In a turn-of-the-century Renaissance Italian mansion, its tyrannical owner, a one-handed, wheelchair-bound pianist, with a strong belief in the occult, is murdered.
Locals in an Italian village believe evil has taken over the estate of a recently deceased pianist where several murders have taken place. The alleged killer: the pianist's severed hand.
Rich, disabled, iron-willed Francis Ingram lives in a musty, turn-of-the century Renaissace Italian mansion, where, despite having only one hand, he maintains his virtuoso skills on the piano. The wheelchair-bound Ingram has a strong belief in the occult and uses the neurotic Hilary Cummins to maintain his massive library of books on spiritualism and the supernatural. Ingram displays a luridly possessive interest in another assistant, his beautiful nurse Julie Holden, who tries to break away from her employer's obsessive control. She finds herself attracted to Bruce Conrad, a charming local musician who cons wealthy tourists. He maintains an amicable relationship with Ingram but recommends Julie leave her manipulative employer. When Ingram is murdered after writing his last will and testament, greedy relatives swarm to the estate and the list of possible suspect grows.
