Harry Yquem, a wealthy broker, remains obsessed with delusions of his devout wife's infidelity.
Fritz Langs second collaboration with scenarist Thea von Harbou (later his wife) furthers her penchant for overloaded melodramatic claptrap (see: DAS WANDERNDE BILD/20), but also displays Langs rapidly-maturing visual mastery. (His next pics were DESTINY/21 and the astonishing leap of DR. MABUSE: THE GAMBLER/22.*) Here, the story elements, even with the familiar Harbou hysteria, have a Langian ring to them as late-blooming marital love is tested under rumors of past infidelity. It all has something or other to do with a mysterious engagement night that left her tied-and-bound in bed while a thief sped off in the night. But whats with those sleazy currency counterfeiters; the illegal diamond exchange that pilfers large rubies during luncheon trysts; a reappearing long-lost brother; or half of the cast spying on the other half? All the ingredients of a nightmarish Langian fever-dream, but minus the control needed to make sense of it. This long missing title barely survived, a single print was found in Brazil, with missing chunks of footage and its own Brazilian titles, now reverse-translated back into German &amp; English. (Perhaps the original cut held together better.) In spite of its provenance, the elements prove quite watchable, a sharp image with minimal blasting balanced against emulsion scratches &amp; the expected odd continuity jump. Hard as it is to crack as a conventional story, its intimations of future work, impressive production values and visual swing make it a must for Lang completists.
