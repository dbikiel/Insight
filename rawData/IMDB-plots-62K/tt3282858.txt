Naomi and Ely have loved each other their whole lives, even though Ely isn't exactly into girls. The institution of a "No Kiss List" has prevented the two from rifts in the past, but bonds are tested when they both fall for the same guy.
Incoming NYU freshmen and childhood neighbors Naomi and Ely have been in love with each other their whole lives, even though Ely isn't exactly into girls. The institution of a "No Kiss List" has prevented the two from rifts in the past, but their bond is tested when they both fall for the same guy. The once-inseparable pair must figure out if their friendship is strong enough to get past such an epic predicament as they struggle with the realities of growing up.
Two NYU freshmen who grew up side-by-side in Greenwich Village - one a gay male, the other a straight female - are as inseparable as two best friends can be; that is, until they fall for the same boy. It is a love story that epitomizes the state of sexuality for Generation Next, but it's not about falling in love. Instead it is like 'High Fidelity' or 'Will &amp; Grace' because the hardest part of loving someone is also learning to let go. This is a modern, coming of age story about growing up whether you like it or not.
