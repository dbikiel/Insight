Agnes Jaoui plays a local political candidate Agathe Villanova, who returns to her childhood home in the south of France in order to help her sister Florence (Pascale Arbillot) sort through their recently deceased mother's belongings. While she's there, the son (Jamel Debbouze as Karim) of family maid (Mimouna Hadji) takes advantage of her presence and attempts to interview her as part of a documentary about successful women that he's undertaken with his film school teacher, Michel (co-writer Jean-Pierre Bacri). However, Michel's intentions aren't quite what they seem, as he's having an affair with Florence and hoping to persuade her to leave her husband. Meanwhile, Karim finds his own marriage threatened when his attractive hotel co-worker (Florence Loiret-Caille) declares an interest in him.
Agathe Villanova (Agnes Jaoui), a feminist with a role on the political scene, returns for ten days to her family home, in the South of France, to help her sister, Florence, to set their deceased mother's affairs in order. In that house, Florence lives with her husband and their children, but also with Mimouna, the housekeeper who came to France with Villanova family when they left Algeria, in the moment of independence. Mimouna's son, Karim (Jamel Debbouze), and his friend Michel Ronsard (Jean-Pierre Bacri) decide to make a documentary on Agathe Villanova, for a collection dedicated to the women who became successful. It's August. The weather is bad, it rains. It's not normal. But nothing is going to be normal.
