A documentary that chronicles life's natural unfolding when a family tries to live by the seasons instead of by the clock.
Featuring the insights for three children (aged 10, 8 and 4), a family leaves the comforts of home to live for 9 months in the remote wilderness of the Canadian North. They spend the long northern winter living in a small cabin with no road access, no electricity, no running water, no internet and not a single watch or clock. Set in the Yukon, All The Time In The World is a deeply personal documentary that explores the theme of disconnecting from our hectic and technology laden lives in order to reconnect with each other, ourselves and our natural environment. Winner of 20 Film Festival Awards from around the world, including 9 Audience Choice Awards, 5 Youth Awards, 7 Environmental Awards and 3 Best Picture Awards. "Top 20 Audience Picks" at Hot Docs.
