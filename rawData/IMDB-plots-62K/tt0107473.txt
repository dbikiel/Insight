After his life is saved by a lonely cop, a mobster who moonlights as a stand-up comedian provides the cop with a beautiful young companion.
Wayne Dobie is a shy police photographer who saves the life of crime boss Frank Milo. Greatful, Milo insists on being Wayne's friend, offering him the companionship of "Glory", one of his employees. Wayne is thus in a difficult situation: he can't be seen to be fraternising with criminals, and he's unsure about how to deal with Glory.
Wayne Dobie is a good police photographer but not very confident with his other duties. Even so he manages to get local racketeer Frank Milo out of a hold up with his life, for which Milo wants to thank him. He does this by sending Glory round for a week, giving Dobie something of a problem. Milo seems to own people and he has a hold over Glory so that if she returns early it will go badly with her. And she's damned attractive too.
