During Napoleon's victorious campaign in Germany, the city of Kolberg gets isolated from the retreating Prussian forces. The population of Kolberg refuses to capitulate and organizes the resistance against the French army, which immediately submits the city to massive bombardments.
Kolberg was a Nazi propaganda film commissioned and financed by propaganda minister Goebbels. Using a historical event from the Napoleonic wars, the film was supposed to teach the populace to defend their town at country at whatever cost, and to die rather than surrender. As the film only came out in the beginning of 1945 when most cinemas where destroyed, it did not reach its public. Its teachings, however, did make it to the towns and villages where Volkssturm units of old men and young boys opposed incoming allied units, causing harm and suffering on all sides.
