A Christmas-themed special featuring characters from Walt Disney Pictures' 53rd full-length animated motion picture, "Frozen (2013)".
Olaf teams up with Sven on a merry mission in Walt Disney Animation Studios' 21-minute featurette "Olaf's Frozen Adventure." It's the first holiday season since the gates reopened and Anna and Elsa host a celebration for all of Arendelle. When the townspeople unexpectedly leave early to enjoy their individual holiday customs, the sisters realize they have no family traditions of their own. So, Olaf sets out to comb the kingdom to bring home the best traditions and save this first Christmas for his friends.
After the re-opening of the castle gates in Frozen (2013), Queen Elsa and Princess Anna decide to throw a grand party. However, before long, the sisters will realise that they have no holiday traditions, and what is even more disheartening, time is running up. Without delay, the cheerful animated snowman, Olaf, embarks on an exciting mission to bring home the best family customs. Will he manage to save snow-capped Arendelle's very first Christmas?
