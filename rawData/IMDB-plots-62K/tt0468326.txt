Tells the story of the eternal issue of human fate, hope, waiting and fulfilment. It shows an individual totally abandoned in his pursuit to fulfil his dreams, without significant influence on his fate...but only seemingly.
A man rows steadily towards a shoreline, beyond which lies a castle. Once inside, he will choose which fish he would like to eat from a menu provided by the castle's butler. The decision is made, and the butler retreats to the kitchen to prepare the fish. What ensues is a lifetime's wait for something that may never arrive.
