Bullied and diminished by his fellow employees, demure and bashful Ryoichi Suzuki finds support in an unusual friendship with a turtle. Together they will share many adventures and finally conquer the world.
In the summer of 2015 in Tokyo, Ryoichi dreamed of becoming a punk rocker when he was younger, but became a timid salary-man at a musical instrument parts company. He has feelings for Kumiko Aso, but he can't tell her how he feels. One day, he has a fateful meeting with a turtle on the rooftop of a department store. He names the turtle Pikadon and he adores it, but his co-workers laugh at him. Ryoichi throws Pikadon into the toilet. He regrets what he did. The turtle though goes through sewerage and meets an old man who lives in the underground. Something then happens.
Once a rebellious teenager and an aspiring guitarist who dreamed of becoming a world-class punk rocker, nowadays, Ryoichi Suzuki is a demure and bashful low-rank white-collar worker who is constantly picked on at every opportunity. To make matters worse, Ryoichi is a recluse and as confident as a mouse, keeping his painful admiration for the kindhearted fellow employee Yuko still secret, so, instead of revealing his feelings to her, he focuses all of his affection to a new-found and loyal friend: the tiny amphibious Pikadon. Sadly, Ryoichi, after confessing his deepest desires and ambitions to the ever-watchful turtle, he will reluctantly, yet, cruelly banish his only friend Pikadon to the maze of Tokyo's intricate sewer system. Is the abandoned pet lost forever?
