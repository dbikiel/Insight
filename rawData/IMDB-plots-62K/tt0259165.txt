A section of a highway is blocked off so that a plane can make an emergency landing on it. However, there are two people still driving on the highway: a man in an SUV and an old lady in a Lincoln.
It's a clear day in L.A.; a jumbo jet needs to make an emergency landing. The radio traffic reporter gets word that the police have cleared a two-mile stretch of the 405 freeway from the 118 to Victory. A young man in an SUV seems to have the road to himself when he looks into his rear view mirror and sees the jet about to land on top of him. He floors it, complications befall him, and he and the jet are on a collision course with the Little Old Lady from Pasadena, driving slowly in her Lincoln. Miracles can happen, and the old woman gets the last word.
