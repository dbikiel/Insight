Professor Jorge Serra Hamilton, an American scientist specialist in the atomic bomb, flees from their transcendental duties, in order to take shelter incognito and for a time in the idyllic Spanish village of Calabuch, a small village on the Mediterranean shores. Oblivious to the relevance of their occasional guest, local residents spend their time engaged in their modest daily chores. The affable professor Hamilton not only integrates perfectly into the small town of Calabuch, forging a deep friendship with its neighbors, but there he will find happiness he craved for.
