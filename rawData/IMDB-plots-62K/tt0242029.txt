His only companion is an elderly storyteller, and the only guide to finding his mother is a dead man's diary. This transporting drama underscores the power of imagination in surviving, and ultimately overcoming, the catastrophe of war.
Mozambique, Civil War. Muidinga is a fragile boy, whose bigger wish is to find his family. He reads in a diary, found beside a dead body, the history of a woman that seeks her son in a ship. Due to his hope to find his own family, Muidinga convinces himself that he is the boy who is being search. He tries to find the woman, with the help of Tuahir, a thin old man full of experience and wisdom. However, Tuahir doesnt know that sometimes the histories of the diary are created by Muidinga.The journey is hard: they move between refugees in state of delirium. Not to get insane, they only have each other. The road which way they walk, as sleepwalkers, is magic: understand their desires and move them from a place to another and doesnt let them die until they achieve the so dreamt sea.
