Two con artistes and car thieves, Vicky (Ajay Devgan) and Sakshi (Preity Zintar) run afoul of Bhanwarlal (Deep Dhillon) and his mob, when they accidentally kill his brother. Bhanwarlal and his other brother (Mayur) both swear to avenge the death of their brother and mistakenly kill Rohit Verma (also Ajay Devgan), who is a look-alike of Vicky. Sakshi thinks that her love is dead and is devastated. Unknown to Sakshi and Bhanwarlal, Vicky is still alive and has taken the place of Rohit, fooling Rohit's dad, Pratap Verma (Vikram Gokhale); Rohit's wife, Neha (Madhuri Dixit), little knowing that Pratap Verma already knows that Rohit is dead, but for some strange and mysterious reason permits Vicky to continue with the impersonation.
