Group of Cossacks are coming to Moscow to buy an ox. Moscow turns out to be a devilish hole crowded with witches. Some local witch seduces Kol'ka Smagin (one of the Cossacks) and robs him of his eyes, giving him alien blue ones instead. Now the Kol'ka and his uncle Zarubin are ready to World War III in order to get the eyes back. The quest begins.
