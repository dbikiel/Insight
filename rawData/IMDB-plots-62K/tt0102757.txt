A telephone operator living an empty, amoral life finds God and loses him again.
This is the story of a young woman (who lives in Los Angeles) with a very boring job. At night however, she and a male partner cruise the bars as swingers. After a time, she begins to believe that a conspiracy exists and decides that she must become a born-again Christian. The movie presents an interesting view of how even the most unlikely person might become born-again.
A telephone operator lives an empty, amoral life. She and her boyfriend spend their evenings picking up other couples for group sex. But she begins to notice little things - things that point to something far greater than the life she knows. There are the two men who come to her apartment, preaching God; the conversation she overhears between her co-workers; and even a strange, mystical tattoo on the back of a woman joining one of the sex sessions. Eventually, a crisis of faith that nearly ends in suicide leads to her spiritual awakening instead. But later she learns that even after finding God, it's possible to lose Him again.
