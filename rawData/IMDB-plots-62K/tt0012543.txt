Buster helps a Native American tribe save their land from greedy oil barons.
Evil oil barons have given the Indians one day to vacate their land. The Indian chief tells his braves to kill the first white man they see. Buster shows up chasing a butterfly. Later he keeps moving the stake to which he is tied and at which he is to be burned. He becomes one of the tribe and helps them with their fight.
Unscrupulous financial speculators and ruthless oil sharks have set their money-grubbing sights on a small patch of Indians' land, and they are willing to do anything to succeed--including stealing the tribe's deed for the territory. As a result, an urgent ultimatum to vacate the area will only infuriate the Great Indian Chief who swears to kill the first paleface who dares to pass through their gate. Of course, the first white man who sets his foot on their campsite is none other than Buster, the avid but utterly unsuspecting lepidopterist. But, is this the end of the innocent entomologist?
