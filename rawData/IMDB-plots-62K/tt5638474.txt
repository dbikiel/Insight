People get entangled in a mystery when a murder is committed on live television.
A TV channel owned by Rahul Oberoi is hacked and the murder of police officer Ramesh Sarnaik is broadcast live. Rahul is interrogated by inspector Kabir Deshmukh of Mumbai police and defended by his lawyer Sia whose boyfriend Ranveer is the prosecution lawyer. During the investigation, police find Karan Parekh, Rahul's old business partner, to be the suspect but before they could get hold of him Karan's murder is also telecast live on the same channel. Kabir now has to find a link which joins Rahul, Karan and Sarnaik which is leading to the murders.
