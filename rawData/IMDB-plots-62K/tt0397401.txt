However, their truck catches fire and they lose the load. Frank becomes desperate to raise the amount, and hides himself with Eddie in the house of his mother. When Frank sees in the newspaper the picture of Crystal Harkness, the wife of the tycoon Harkness, Eddie confirms that she was a former strip dancer and buried with a valuable necklace.
