A cartoon version of the voyage of the Argonauts (Greek Mythology) with the aim of getting the Gold Fleece.
Two Greek teenage-goats find the ruins of a ship on the shore and next to them a long-haired old man with a gray beard who tells them the history of this ship. The old ship was called "Argo", and it was built by a skilled architect named Arg. On the ship itself was installed the wooden head of the goddess Athena. The greatest heroes of Hellas, led by Jason himself, sailed on it for the Golden Fleece to the Colchis kingdom.
