A deranged man hides in the attic of a new house and becomes obsessed with the unsuspecting family that moves in.
A deranged man, Tom Sykes, hides out in the attic while an unsuspecting couple (Rogers &amp; McKean) and their family carry on their life in the house below. Once Tom stops just hiding out and becomes involved with the family and, in particular, the wife, the problems begin. An original USA made for cable movie.
"A well crafted story about a dangerous mental patient who hides in the attic of a beautiful house. Though on paper it sounds too daft to be true, the way the tale unfolds it is all too plausible. Well-acted and real hide-behind-the fingers stuff. Builds to such a pitch that I jumped sky-high." THE LONDON JOURNAL
