Historia de Catalu√±a de 1899 a 1909
Film that chronicles the historical events that took place in Barcelona between 1899 and 1909, since the return of the soldiers of the war of Cuba to the popular uprising known as 'The Tragic Week'. Josep and his friend Frederic Palau, soldiers in Cuba, are returning home with a handful of dollars. Palau's family is rich and receives with open arms the young Josep. Roser and Remei, Frederic nieces, yearn for the guest. Josep chooses Remei and marries her, although the attraction between brothers in law is strong and continues throughout the years. The main plot, however, is not the life of this family, which is only an excuse to describe the political and social conflicts of the time.
