The fiend faces the spectacular mind-bending consequences of his free-wheeling rarebit binge.
Adapted from Winsor McCay's films and comics of the period, this film follows the established theme: the "Rarebit Fiend" gorges himself on rarebit and thus suffers spectacular hallucinatory dreams.
With the Edison Military Band providing the soundtrack, a gourmand who's already three sheets to the wind sits alone at a table in white formal wear and a top hat, surrounded by bottles of beer and a fondue pot with cheese for his rarebit. He gorges himself, then heads for home, tipsy, holding onto a swaying obelisk. Once in his quarters, it's straight to bed where he dreams of imps, a dizzying flight over the city on his bed, a fall to a steeple, then a crash through his roof onto the floor. A rare bit indeed.
Before a large and mouth-watering plate of the exquisite Welsh rarebit, a famished man in a white suit and a short-brimmed top hat gobbles down the molten delicacy, washing it down with bottles of cold and bubbly beer. When the feast is finally over, the staggering glutton heads back home, when suddenly, complex and amazingly weird hallucinations start to bombard him, as the whole world spins out of control. Will his nice and soft bed be the end of the fiend's troubles or is this unexpected adventure bound to get even worse?
