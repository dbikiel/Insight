Three carhops try to help save a failing drive-in restaurant.
Angel, Cupcake and Danielle are two carhops and a French Chef who take over operations of a failing drive-in burger joint. Together they use their good looks and better sense to turn it into a thriving business. An oil tycoon named Carter Axe has other plans for them, though. With his focus set on obtaining the land under the drive-in so that he can bulldoze it and build a giant gas station at that location, he sends a group of thugs to pressure the ladies.
