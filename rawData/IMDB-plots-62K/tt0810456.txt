After learning the identity of the man who killed her husband, a young widow struggles with whether to forgive the killer or avenge her husband's death.
Based on the drama by Rocco Familiari, Black Sun is rooted in the facts of an event that transpired two decades ago. Agata and Manfredi is a young couple in Catania, deeply in love and growing happier as time goes by. When Manfredi is shot and killed, Agata emerges from her shock with a desire for vengeance. Once she identifies the murderer herself, she methodically seduces him in order to exact a confession. Zanussi's film centers on a woman who, like many Sicilians, is inherently distrustful of a justice system that veers toward leniency and inaction. Almost philosophical in tone and rich in symbolism, the film is universal with its idealistic romance and vows of "forever" while being simultaneously singular. Valeria Golino as Agata turns in a performance that conveys the hope and drive of a woman on a path towards tragedy.
The life of Agata and Manfredi is the very expression of bliss. They are young, beautiful, rich, they love each other and have just got married. Faced with their splendid home, a hovel houses the tortured nights of Salvo, a drug addict in need. One morning, Salvo, exhausted by the suffering that gnawed at him, took a rifle and shot down Manfredi who was sleeping in the sun on his terrace. Agata, destroyed by the disappearance of the one she continues to love, does not believe in justice. She will identify herself the killer. She methodically seduces him in order to exact a confession and revenge.
