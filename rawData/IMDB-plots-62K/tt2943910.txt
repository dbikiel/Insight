Twenty-something New Yorker Barb Schwartz (Sas Goldberg) somehow ended up in a life that kinda... sucks. She has a paralegal job she hates, a drab studio apartment on Roosevelt Island, and an overbearing family who never lets her forget she's still single. When she is reunited with her childhood BFF, ballet dancer Billy (Jake Wilson), she is inspired to turn her life around by revisiting her first love: comedy.
