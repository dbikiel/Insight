The Cockroach That Ate Cincinnati is about rock &amp; roll, hero worship, hallucinations, drugs, madness, paranoia, rebellion and the search for individual integrity in a world on the brink of cultural and physical self destruction.An eccentric who calls himself "The Captain" has convinced a couple of novice film-makers to help him record "pure thoughts" - a filmic testament of his experiences and observations of the past 3 decades. He leads us through the streets, back alleys and vacant lots of Windsor and Detroit, spouting a witty and wildly complex stream of sardonic anecdotes and theories concerning pop culture, rock and roll and nuclear dread. As the stories become more involved and the relationships between them becomes more clear, his behaviour becomes alarmingly erratic. In the end, we witness the Captain's final descent into madness and confusion.The film poses questions about storytelling -- who owns the stories we tell as individuals and as a culture, while the stories themselves explore notions of fame and obscurity. The desire for fame. The fear of fame. The role of pop icons as revolutionary forces. The Cockroach That Ate Cincinnati is a comic study of culture, identity and madness.
