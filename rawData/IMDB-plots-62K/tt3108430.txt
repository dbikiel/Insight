The complex subject of population growth is observed via three individuals who are tackling the topic on a personal level.
Most of us perceive that world population is still growing at an alarming rate, with declining births in the developed world being offset by growing populations in the developing world. But are these claims of population explosion mere outdated scaremongering or do they bear some truth? Taking cues from the groundbreaking research of statistics guru, Hans Rosling, Misconception offers a fascinating glimpse at how the world is tackling these population shifts. Following three distinct stories, director Jessica Yu grapples with the way in which macro population trends affect the individual. As all three subjects point to the continued failure of top-down policy making to serve the best interests of their populations, Misconception forges an insight into this highly charged political issue, on a human level, to reveal how we are all ultimately striving for the same goal.
