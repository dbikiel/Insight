Contrary to most of the uninformed and silly reviews on this documentary, this movie "The Truck Farmer" is a serious educational piece intended to inform audiences of the 1950's where their food came from, how it's grown, by whom, and how it gets to their supermarkets and tables on the cold months when growing is impossible in Northern areas of the country. Yes, the film is stiff and dated by "modern" standards - kind of like how an episode of "Dragnet" might look to today's audience. This is quite typical of such documentaries. No, there's not a lot of clever dialog, stunts, special effects, or a laugh track, but this was intended as education designed to reach people where there were and to clue them on to things they likely never troubled themselves to think of. Unfortunately, consumers of today are likely even less informed on where their daily food comes from than audiences of the '50's were. The folks making the jokes about this documentary have missed the point. Categorize this one with "Hemp for Victory" and other informative shorts in the style of 60 years ago.
