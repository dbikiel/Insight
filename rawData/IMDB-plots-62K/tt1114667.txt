From his inner-city roots in L.A., D.L. Hughley has become one of the smartest, most popular stand-up comics working today. This HBO special--his fourth--will show audiences just how far he's come, and how funny he is--with no apologies necessary! Taking the stage in Washington, D.C., Hughley focuses on such topics as the dangers of living in the nation's capital, the qualifications of the 2008 presidential candidates, the current administration, the immigration debate, Cuban refugees, airplane restrictions, the 'n' word, Don Imus and freedom of speech, whites and blacks on cruise ships, Paris Hilton, and much more--including D.L.'s now-famous interaction with hapless audience members in the first row.
