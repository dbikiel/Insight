When caf√©-owner from Chez Nous has financial problems, six ordinary regular customers organize a squat and steal a valuable necklace from a heavily guarded museum.
Chez Nous is about 'gay friendly' pub 'Chez Nous' which, threatened by bankruptcy, might be sold to a powerful nightlife proprietor. To prevent this sale the regular customers (an extra ordinary group of friends; male - female / homosexual - heterosexual) plan to commit a heist during the Amsterdam Gay Pride. They want to steal a diamond necklace (which is worth millions) from the Amstel Museum and hope to escape and save their favourite hangout this way. Will they succeed?
