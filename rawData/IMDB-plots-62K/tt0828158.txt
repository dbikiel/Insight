After he's shot during a heist in East L.A., an armored-truck driver wrestles with rehabilitation and tracking down the man who committed the crime. But their lives are thrown into chaos after Felix miraculously survives a violent on-the-job hijacking led by Adell Baldwin, a merciless criminal driven by power and greed. Now facing a difficult recovery and struggling with a nasty new temper, Felix becomes obsessed with tracking down his attackers before they frame him for the crimes they committed.
Felix De La Pena (Leguizamo) is a hardworking armored-truck driver, a loving husband to his wife Marina (Perez) and a caring father of two in East LA's Boyle Heights neighborhood. After being abducted and shot in the head during a hijacking led by Adell Baldwin (Gibson), Felix loses his memory, exhibits erratic post-trauma behavior, and is framed as a prime suspect for the crime. Since he cannot provide any leads to FBI agent Steve Perelli (Bobby Cannavale), Felix is forced to try to find his assailant by himself.
