A genetically manipulated and very hungry dinosaur escapes from a bioengineering company and reeks havoc on the local desert town. A security guard and a girl environmentalist try to stop both it and the company's doomsday bioweapon.
A brilliant geneticist, Diane Ladd, plans to expose a lethal virus to every human being on the planet. Her objective: to destroy humankind in favour of her new strain of prehistoric dinosaurs. Two people stand in the way of her diabolical plan, a cynical night watchman and a lovely idealistic environmentalist. The two must overcome their differences long enough to uncover the scientist's scheme and fight her carnivorous creations in a desperate battle against the extinction of the human race.
Dr. Jane Tiptree, a brilliant geneticist who feels that Dinosaurs need never die and with government funding arranges to bring back dinosaurs using chicken eggs (because some moron says dinosaurs are giant chickens). One of her new and improved carnosaurs escapes and runs amok in a small town while his big brother is waiting to be set loose on the city. Unless the truth can be unleashed, it could be a new dawn for dinosaurs driving mammals to extinction.
