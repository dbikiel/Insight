Federal agent Terry McVey, posing as a guest at the Silver Bar Dude Ranch, investigates the disappearance of noted engraver Frank Adams who is being forced to produce counterfeit bills by the ranch owner, Gordon West. Complicating matters is spunky Barbara Adams, who, while catching the eye of McVey, also manages to get herself captured while snooping around the cave her father is held prisoner in.
