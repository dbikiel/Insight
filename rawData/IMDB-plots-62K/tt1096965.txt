Ko-chan used to be an ordinary student, but a fight with another student changed all of that. He fights now, is in brawls, finds trouble and makes trouble and is a de facto gang member. He stands up for his friends and they stand by his side. He also has a crush on Yamada, one of the pretty girls in class.
