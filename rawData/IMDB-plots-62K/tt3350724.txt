A lost soul stumbles drunken through the city. In a park, Death finds him and shows him many things.
Sadly, a man dies unexpectedly in the street from a horrible car accident and his immortal soul is wandering alone and perplexed. Suddenly, the silver night-lights are now dimmer, the town is insufferably empty, and an unbearable, almost palpable solitude is crushing the man as the ever-present Pale Death is approaching. "Please, show me many things so that I remember", says the young man unable to come to terms with his demise, so without delay, the omnipotent Death grants him his wish. More is what his heart desires, but the Reaper is impatient.
