Chittan, a social outcast, has grown up in a cemetery. A drug dealer finds him a job in a cannabis farm. In prison, he meets a conman, Shakti. This friendship transforms him from his stony existence.
Chittan (Vikram) is born to a vagrant in a cemetery, who dies soon after. Raised with no contact to the outside world except with dead bodies, he grows up inept at social interaction. An acquaintance with a neighborhood drug dealer Gomathi (Sangitha) gets him a job as a handyman in a cannabis farm. Chittan ends up in jail where he makes his first real friendship - with a conman Shakti (Surya). When Chitthan and Sakthi try to step out of their lives of illicit activities, the local drug-lord interferes.
