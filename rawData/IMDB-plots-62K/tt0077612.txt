This is the story of two people, from totally different backgrounds and social status. The boy is a Swiss immigrant working to help his impoverished family, and the girl comes from an affluent family, and who is also engaged to someone, whom she really doesn't know or care. And she also doesn't tell him who she is.
Beth Atherton as a child came from a poor home, but a home filled with love, until her father died. She then learned some things about her parents past. Her father was poor when he married her mother who came from a very wealthy family. She married him against her parents wishes, Beth's grandparents. Now Beth is in her grandparents care, and while they take proper care of her, the grandfather is cold and selfish and the grandmother is too weak to stand up to him. Against her will she is promised into an arranged marriage to make her family wealthier, and Beth has little motivation to fight it, until history repeats itself, and Beth falls in love with a poor man who promises her the love she knew in her fathers home. Now Beth has a choice to make, but what will be the consequences of her choice? Are they more than she is willing to pay?
