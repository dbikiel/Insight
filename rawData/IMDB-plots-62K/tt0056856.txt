Since all three are unemployed they while their time away roaming the streets and chasing girls. One day Antonio's aunt asks him to stay with her and his cousins in Rome. He accepts her offer and enrolls at a university in Rome leaving his two friends behind who envy him for his new upscale lifestyle. But eventually Antonio returns to the village, initially just for a day.
