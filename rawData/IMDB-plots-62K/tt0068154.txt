Bambino tries to teach his brother Trinity how to become an outlaw, but the two wind up saving a pioneer family and breaking up an arms ring instead.
A couple of two-bit thieving brothers try and keep a promise to their dying father: stick together and become successful outlaws. Bambino reluctantly agrees to show younger Trinity the ropes, but their gentle demeanors tend to diminish their haul by repeatedly helping the selfsame family they initially held up. Fun ensues in town and at the local Spanish mission where they are taken for federal agents, mistakenly so identified by Trinity's young love interest, daughter of the aforementioned family.
Having no other choice in front of their father's deathbed, the rivalling and mutually abusive twin siblings, Trinità and Bambino, are forced to make a reluctant promise: to always work in unison to become good bandits. With this in mind, Bambino will attempt to show the tricks of the trade to his good-for-nothing brother with the lightning-fast right hand; however, it seems that Trinità is only interested in beans and charming, but naive, blue-eyed ladies. But everything is about to change in the dusty town of San José, where the two brothers posing as federal agents will try to get their hands on as much money as possible, but instead, they will end up lending a hand to the helpless monks of the local mission. Is this what the honourable horse-thief father wished for his sons?
