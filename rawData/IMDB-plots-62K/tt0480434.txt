An ugly crocodile and a beautiful cow fall in love. Everybody else laughs at them.
All the crocodiles were like crocodiles, and this crocodile was some strange one: he was very fond of flowers. And then one day he landed on a beautiful meadow, and there on the meadow he met a beautiful cow. She said: "Strange crocodile, do you smell flowers?" "Yes," said the crocodile, "I like them." "And me, too," said the cow. Yes, if they liked the same thing, flowers and leaves, then they certainly could love each other. And as the most ordinary lover he read poetry, only in crocodile. "Bu-bu-bu-bu .." They loved each other very much, but no one believed in this love. Everyone said: "No, this can not be, they are so different. What do you. Such a beautiful cow and such an ordinary-looking crocodile - " They wanted always to be together, because they had much in common - flowers and leaves.
