Modeling themselves after an idyllic cookie-cutter suburban 1950s family, a colony of insects move from South America into the United States with the intent of getting access to the nation's nuclear resources.
Giant praying mantises living in a South American jungle decide to move into suburban USA. Disguised as humans, they are planning something. Could it be connected to Dad's job in the power station perhaps ? One day the daughter mantis forgets WHAT she really is when she's with her boyfriend. Oops.
