A songwriter finds out that his beautiful girlfriend is going to be an artist's model.
Around the turn of the century, two young men, Johnnie Bennett, a composer and Steve Adams, an artist, go to New York City to make their fortune. They both fall in love with the same girl, Patricia O'Neill. The artist paints a picture of her which outrages her father's sensibilities but, as a result of the picture, she wins a chance to star in a Broadway play. She soon learns that the artist is just a trifler, and turns to the composer, who loves her sincerely.
