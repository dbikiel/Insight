A young dropout falls in love with a nightclub dancer...
Berry is a nice teenage boy from a Dutch suburban villa family, who alas abuses the excessive liberty granted by his mostly absent pa, an actor, committing truancy from his elite school in bad down-town company. Despite this dwindling future perspectives, his cute and cocky appearance makes him quite a lady-killer; Berry counts himself quite lucky to become the instantly intimate boyfriend of crazy Thera, a junkie who stopped modeling professionally or anything else productive. The pair engages in a passionate affair, and impulsively decides to embark on a 'world tour' to their arbitrary favorite destinations -Barcelona, Denver and Tonga- which they finance by cashing rent and warrants from many interested persons for the fine residence of an old lady Thera was in fact just house-sitting. After Berry says goodbye indefinitely to his well-groomed and -behaved elder brother Rein while showering together, the 'elopers' start spending the ill-gotten funds like water in a luxury hotel, but even there the flimsy foundation of their purposeless relationship starts crumbling, as does drug-addicted Thera's health...

Suddenly Thera ODs terribly, leaving Berry alone with his obsessive but unanswered love which drives him crazy...
