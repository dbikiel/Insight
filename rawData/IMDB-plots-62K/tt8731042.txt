With her husband and child in tow, she has timed the visit to meet her mother, who still lives on the mainland but is travelling around Taiwan on a Saga-style coach tour. To avoid unwanted attention, the family follow the coach around, pretending to be locals. Based on the real life experiences of the director Ying Liang.
