Two French college girls each meet a boy named Patrick and quickly realize that it is less a coincidence then they think.
Students Veronique and Charlotte meet the same man separately, who makes a date with each of them separately the next evening. When they both show up, he shows up, too, with a third woman.
In picturesque Paris, the young students, Charlotte and VÃ©ronique, share a small apartment, interested only in their studies. However, little do they know that at Le Jardin du Luxembourg, Patrick, a charming pickup artist, will manage to seduce them both, of course, behind each other's backs. Under those circumstances, how is this blind double date going to end up?
