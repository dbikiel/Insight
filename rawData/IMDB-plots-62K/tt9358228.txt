A look at the rise and fall of disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein featuring interviews with former colleagues and those who accused him of sexual misconduct.
Investigation about one of the most media cases of the early 21st Century that it created all a revolution around the world-wide: Harvey Weinstein. Born and raised in the New York City of the 50s and 60s years, Harvey and his brother Bob were capable to create a little company named Miramax, that eventually was turning along the the 80s and 90s in one of the most important and multi-awarded movie companies of the late 20th Century. But behind the money, glamour, upper-class parties and the awards gala was hidden a scaring reality unknown for everyone except for those to unfortunately lived it: a man of success with a dark side which along some decades forced and abused about a hundred women, in an empire of silence and horror that seemed have no end. Using testimonies and interviews to his victims, Weinstein's former colleagues and an extensive work of documentation, Untouchable examines not only the global impact of the before famous and after infamous Hollywood's mogul but how it unwittingly did to rise the world movement for equality #MeToo.
