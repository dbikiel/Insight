An evil tree stump, jealous of two trees in love, starts a forest fire.
It's spring, and the flowers, mushrooms, and trees do their calisthentics. Some trees play a tune, using vines for harp strings and a chorus of robins. A nasty looking hollow tree does battle with a much healthier-looking tree for the attentions of a female tree, and starts a fire in the process.
