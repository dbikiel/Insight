A gentleman by the name of Bachi dies but can't be admitted into heaven because of an evil action committed during his lifetime. He is given the opportunity to return to the living for a half day. Finding himself embroiled in an amorous relationship, the gentleman forgets what he had permission to come back to the living for. Back at the gate of Saint Peter's, he feels he has lost his last chance and is doomed. Instead he discovers that that half day, and its chance to love, has redeemed him.
