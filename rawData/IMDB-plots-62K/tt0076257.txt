A series of short, highly irreverent, and often tasteless skits.
Madcap spoof, a collection of comedy skits includes the Kung-Fu parody, "A Fistful Of Yen" and "Catholic School Girls In Trouble." Enjoy the future of movie-going with the "Feel-A-Round" theater experience. See a notable and highly respected actor as the clumsiest waiter in motion picture history. Watch such character as Cleopatra Schwartz and Big Jim Slade tickle your funny bone until it has to be removed surgically!
This movie is out of control. There aren't any spoilers in here because the movie doesn't actually have an ending. It can't because Kentucky Fried Movie is a collection of (I say) short films. Every one of them is Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker literal humor with a site gag to go along with every line. I loved it. I watch it frequently because you can watch a segment and watch another one later. I was surprised when I realized it came out in 1977. It's a potential stoner movie - I'm surprised it didn't come out in 1972.
