Susan and Lorenzo have been married for over five years and they are starting to drift apart. So into her life comes an angel, which only Susan can see, to tell her that there will be trouble ahead if they do not work out their problems. Lorenzo is developing insecticide #383 at Finlay Vega Chemical Co. and plans to test it on a camping trip that he takes with Susan, but the trip becomes a an obstacle course for him.
Five years in, the bloom has come off the marriage of scientist Larry Vega and wealthy socialite Susan Vega n√©e Bewell due to their differences. Those differences are heightened and the problems in the marriage exasperated by her closest friends, who he does not like in they always trying to get her and by association him to live beyond the means afforded by his income. Their differences are further heightened when Larry, who with his friend Bill Finlay own and operate their own chemical company, plans to do field work for two years going to remotest parts of the globe to test a new insecticide he has developed, he wanting Susan to go along. With those problems, Susan begins to see a vision of a man, who she initially believes is an intruder in their home, but who she later comes to believe and ultimately realize is her Guardian Angel. Beyond the seeming incredulity of such a story and thus the belief by others that she may be crazy, Susan does not want to divulge her vision, least of all to Larry, in the Guardian Angel's resemblance to her favorite actor, handsome James Mason. Indeed, the Guardian Angel has arrived in her psyche at this juncture to help her deal with her and Larry's crumbling marriage. But in the Guardian Angel's resemblance to Mason, it may cause rather than resolve more complications in Susan and Larry's relationship.
