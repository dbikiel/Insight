In a top-secret military facility, a team of scientists under the command of Dr. Woodman are developing a "super soldier" blending several DNAs including alien DNA. When the experiment goes wrong, a group of elite soldiers are assigned by the military Anslow to exterminate the lethal creatures created by Dr. Woodman.
In a secret government lab, Dr. Alan Woodman conducts experiments to develop a violent alien into a revolutionary fighting machine. The trial fails and the creature escapes into compound, killing everyone in its path. Only Woodman and his assistant Charlie survive. After locking down the facility, they send out a distress call and the top covert military force responds. Led by the beautiful but tough Rita Talon, the team has been instructed to locate and destroy the creature. Working with Woodman and Charlie, they begin the hunt but quickly realize that they have to deal with more than just the creature.
