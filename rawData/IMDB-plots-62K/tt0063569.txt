An aging actress named Irina Arkidana pays summer visits to her brother Pjotr Nikolayevich Sorin and her son Konstantin on a country estate. On one occasion, she brings Trigorin, a successful novelist, with her. Nina, a free and innocent girl on a neighboring estate, falls in love with Boris Trigorin. As Trigorin lightly consumes and rejects Nina, so the actress all her life has consumed and rejected her son, who loves Nina. The victims are destroyed while the sophisticates continue on their way.
Konstantin is an emotional and passionate young man. He is an aspiring writer, who wants to write on his own terms, and not in any conventional manner. He has written a play, which is unconventional both in structure and theme. He wants to show to it to a small group of people at a makeshift outdoor theater at his Uncle Sorin's lakeside estate in the Russian countryside, that group which includes his actress mother Arkadina, and her lover, famed writer Trigorin. Arkadina and Trigorin are both self-absorbed with their own fame, and dismiss Konstantin's writing ability. The only person who seems to have any faith in his writing is Dorn, Sorin's doctor. Konstantin has gotten Nina, the daughter of a neighboring landowner, to appear as the lead in the play. Konstantin loves Nina, his love which is unrequited. Although she carries on with a poor local schoolteacher named Medvedenko, Masha, the daughter of Sorin's estate's bailiff, loves Konstantin, that love which too is unrequited. Nina wants to become an actress, but seems more enthralled with the idea of celebrity than being a real actress. The question becomes whether any of these individuals can reach ultimate happiness with their competing desires.
