To get an order for 1,000 yachts from a middle-east sheik, two boat companies have to race 'Göta kanal', a canal through Sweden, east to west. There are no rules in this game and the winner gets the order.
An order for 1,000 yachts for a middle-east sheik is up for grabs. The list of contestants has been narrowed down to two companies: one is a multinational one with good backing and the other is run by visionaries and enthusiasts with their main focus on rowing-boats. Having a hard time to decide between the two the sheik declares a race on the Göta Canal through Sweden, from the capital of Stockholm to the second city of Gothenburg, where the winner gets the order. Pretty soon it becomes obvious that winning does not mean strictly abiding to sea rules and regulations.
To get an order for 1000 yachts to a middle-east sheik, two boat companies have to race 'Göta kanal', a canal from the Swedish east coast to Vänern, the biggest lake of Sweden, and which together with some other canals connects the east coast to the west. The winner gets the order and there are no rules in this game.
