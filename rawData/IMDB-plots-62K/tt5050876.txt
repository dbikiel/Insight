Metin is a young man living in a Stockholm suburb governed by unwritten rules. He is different, he writes a diary of everything he sees, names and places are documented in great detail. When the book disappears his life is turned upside down. Ivica Zubak blends humor and gravity in a story about seizing life's opportunities.
