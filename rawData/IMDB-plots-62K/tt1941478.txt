Follows Portugal's first fascist superhero: the ultra patriotic Captain Falcon!
A satire on anti-communist paranoia in the days of fascist dictatorship in Portugal. The series follows the adventures of the "Lusitanian superhero," the ultra-patriotic Captain Falcao, a man who follows the direct orders of Antonio de Oliveira Salazar in the fight against the "red menace". Starring Goncalo Waddington, as Captain Falcao, David Chan Cordeiro (also responsible for coordinating the work of doubles) as his sidekick Puto Perdiz and Jose Pinto in the role of portuguese dictator,Antonio de Oliveira Salazar. Visually, "Captain Falcao" presents itself in the register of the classic "Green Hornet" with "poor quality" image to complete the nostalgic wink.
