An electric shock enables Sach to predict numbers.
A shock gives "Sach" Jones the ability to visualize numbers before they come up and he and the other Bowery Boys, "Slip" Mahoney, Chuck and Myron, head for Las Vegas to win some money for their landlady. There, "Sach" wins a fortune at roulette, which convinces crooks Tony Murlock, Sam, and Oggy that he has a system. Using Carol LaRue as bait, they try to get his system and failing, they frame him on a phony-murder charge to blackmail him.
