When TROY turned on crime boss DMITRI DEBARTOLLA he was forced to leave Los Angeles and lay low in Miami. After two years, and the loss of his leg in a shootout with a Cuban crime syndicate, Troy returns to LA to reclaim what is rightfully his. A reunion with his former partners in a rundown hotel sets the stage for an explosive encounter where past and present collide.
Revenge comes full circle in Hotel California when three former partners (Troy, Pete, and Al) with strong connections to the underground crime scene of L.A., reunite in a dingy hotel room to rehash the past. Anxiety builds as they take part in a calculated mind game of wit and loyalty. With an all-star cast featuring Erik Palladino as Troy (Over There, ER), Simon Rex as Pete (Scary Movie 3/4), Tatyana Ali as Jessie (Fresh Prince of Bel-Air), supermodel Tyson Beckford as Al, Yancey Arias as Hector (Kingpin, Die Hard 4), and Raymond J. Barry as crime boss Dmitri (Steel City), Hotel California checks you into a twisted world of crime, drugs, and murder, where tension mounts, bullets fly, and blood flows.
