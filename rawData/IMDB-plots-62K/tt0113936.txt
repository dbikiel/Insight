To embarrass his rival, a scheming senator uses nitwit Ohio teens who are invited to a Washington gathering on educational failure.
While on detention, a group of misfits and slackers have to write a letter to the President explaining what is wrong with the education system. There is only one problem, the President loves it! Hence, the group must travel to Washington to meet the Main Man.
At Fairmount High School in Columbus, Ohio, a debauched group of kids rule over the school, led by stoners Mark 'Dags' D'Agastino and Reggie Barry, who preach partying over education. When Dags and Reggie, along with a small assorted group of kids are caught cutting school and throwing a house party in the whiny and incompetent Principal Moss' house, they are put into detention where they are asked to write a letter to the President of the USA on the problems with education. Yet, only the school 'brainiac' Lisa Perkins writes it and mails it where it's a hit with the President who invites them to Washington on a field trip to speak for education reforms. With Principal Moss and the new keyboarding teacher, Miss Milford, chaperoning them, Dags and Reggie, along with Lisa, shy stoner Wanda, school tramp Carla, king geek Virus, biker chick Meg, quiet poet Herbert, narc Steve, and the 'stupid fat kid' Miosky, take an eventual bus trip to Washington... if they can ever get there.
