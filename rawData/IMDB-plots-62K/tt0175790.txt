A humourously musical retelling of the Biblical story of Joseph (Donny Osmond).
In this filmed adaption of the long-running musical, we see the story of Joseph (Donny Osmond), son of Jacob (Sir Richard Attenborough). The favored son, he is betrayed by his jealous brothers and sold into slavery and driven to Egypt. Though beset with adversity, Joseph perseveres through wit and faith and becomes the Governor of Egypt, second only to the Pharaoh (Robert Torti). This all the sets the scene for when he meets his brothers who have come to Egypt to purchase food.
The Narrator (Maria Friedman) draws a school audience repeatedly into a very twentieth century "Technicolor" production of the Biblical story. Patriarch Jacob (Sir Richard Attenborough) lived happily with his dozen sons, but his favoritism for bright Joseph (Donny Osmond), symbolized by the gift of a spectacular multi-colored coat, makes his brothers so jealous, they end up selling him as a slave, and staging his death. He rises in the service of wealthy Potiphar, though his adulterous wife is falsely accused and incarcerated. His gift of dream-telling however wins him Pharoah's (Robert Torti's) favor, in charge of planning for the seven years of extreme poverty after seven good ones he prophesied. When his brothers come to beg for food, it's time for reckoning and nobility.
