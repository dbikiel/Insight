Returning a lost wallet gains unemployed veteran Chuck Scott a job as chauffeur to Eddie Roman, a seeming gangster whose enemies have a way of meeting violent ends. The job proves nerve-wracking, and soon Chuck finds himself pledged to help Eddie's lovely, fearful, prisoner-wife Lorna to escape. The result leaves Chuck caught like a rat in a trap, vainly seeking a way out through dark streets. But the real chase begins when the strange plot virtually starts all over again...
Chuck Scott (Robert Cummings) is a soldier back from the war and down on his luck in Miami until he finds a wallet in the street which allows him to buy a long-overdue meal for himself. Thinking better of his good luck, he returns the wallet to the owner, tough gangster Eddie Roman (Steve Cochran) and his henchman Gino (Peter Lorre), two expensive thugs who do business by murdering their competitors in vicious ways. Roman hires Scott as his chauffer having him drive wife Lorna Roman (Mich√®le Morgan) to the beach but Lorna wants out of the marriage and asks Scott to escort her to Cuba. Scott plans to make the trip and quit the brutish employ of Roman at the same time. As it happens a war malady causes Scott to lose sight of his goals, recovering enough to follow through but with Roman and Gino in pursuit.
