When Pierre Hoffman integrates the prestigious College St Joseph, it finds among 3th 1 of strange behavior, a hostility diffuse, a deaf violence. Is it because their professor of French has just to throw by the window in full-course? Because they are a class pilot of gifted children and therefore harassed by other students? Because they have lost all hope in the future of the world?
A replacement teacher arrives in a class of elite students after their professor jumps out of the window. He soon notices the strangely violent behavior of this united group of six. Unusually smart and precocious, the teens spread hostility and fear across the school. Soon, the teacher discovers their dark vision of a doomed future and their contempt towards the powerless adults who can no longer protect them.
