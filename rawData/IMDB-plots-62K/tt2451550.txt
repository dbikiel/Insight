GONE TOO FAR follows two estranged teenage brothers over the course of a single day as they meet for the first time, and struggle to accept each other for who they are. Yemi can't wait for his big brother to join him on the estate in Peckham - but when Ikudayisi arrives from Nigeria wearing socks and sandals Yemi questions both his judgement and his African heritage. A day on the estate filled with danger and excitement teaches both of them the values of family and self respect.
When British teenager Yemi meets his long lost Nigerian brother Ikudaisy, he quickly finds his estranged sibling's African heritage and unimpressive socks and sandals fashion sense a blight on his own street cred, particularly when trying to impress local trouble-making temptress Armani. As simmering adolescent passions and West Indian-African tensions erupt over the course of one day on their estate, both Yemi and Ikudaisy must decide where their loyalties lie. Adapted from Bola Agbaje's Olivier award-winning play, the film is a delightfully funny tale from the endz of Peckham that still finds the space to address serious racial tensions.
