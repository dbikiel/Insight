Today, Pope Francis is changing the Vatican's conservative tone. But for decades, U.S. nuns have been bucking the Church hierarchy by living a gospel of love, social justice and inclusion. From confronting U.S. bishops over the Affordable Care Act, to protesting for women's equality at the Vatican, Radical Grace follows three sisters who transform American politics and the Catholic Church.
When the Vatican reprimands American sisters - citing their "radical feminism" - they become the spiritual and symbolic center of a battle for the heart of the Catholic Church. Radical Grace follows three fearless nuns who risk their place in the Church to follow another higher calling: social justice.
