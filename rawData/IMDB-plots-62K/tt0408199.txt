An unfortunate bank robber takes an escaped mental patient, wanted for murder, as hostage.
Escaped mental patient, Erkki, is the prime suspect in the brutal murder of an old widow. Only Sara Rask, Erkki's therapist, believes Erkki to be innocent. While she cooperates with detective Karsten Skov to find her patient, Erkki is at the wrong place at the wrong time, being taken hostage by bank robber Morgan. But after completing the perfect getaway, Morgan gets more than he bargained for when Erkki refuses to be set free.
