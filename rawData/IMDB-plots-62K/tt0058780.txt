Three expectant mothers think back over their sex lives.
Stockholm, 1915. Three women, Agda, Adele and Angela are about to give birth in a clinic. All three recall their past, especially the circumstances that led them to this hospital room. Agda, a housemaid made pregnant by a young middle-class man, has just married a homosexual artist. Adele, married to a farmer, suffers from frigidity, and is expecting a baby which is practically the product of a rape by her husband. As for Angela, a young woman from aristocratic background, she is waiting to give life to an illegitimate child after throwing herself into the arms of fifty-year-old Casanova. In these conditions will the three children to be born be happy?
