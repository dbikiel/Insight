Believing he has nothing to lose, Bird resigns his position and withdraws his modest life savings in order to spend his remaining time in a "posh" seaside resort. There he keeps his own counsel about his condition and meets people who live in a world he could never have imagined existed. Incredibly, he finds personal and professional opportunities now open to him that that he never dreamed would be his, but unfortunately, he is no position to take advantage of them, until fate lends a hand.
George Bird is a salesman of agricultural machinery who finds out that he doesn't have long to live. He decides to a the last holiday and begins to find out that he was a more worthwhile and interesting person than he ever allowed himself to live.
