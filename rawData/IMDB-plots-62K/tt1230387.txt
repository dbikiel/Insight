When Michael Peck's overbearing parents force him to compete in the science fair, he thinks he can shock everyone. Instead, Peck finds that teen angst might be clich√©, but it still sucks.
Nervous little 104-pound sophomore Michael Peck would like to join the wrestling team, but when he breeches the subject to his intellectual-snob parents after getting booted from band, they're unable to hear him and prepare a contract for him to join the Science Club instead (a parent-child agreement documented in legal terms which he is forced to sign and obligated to maintain). Skipping school with his best bud Geiger, they run across two senior girls, Emily and Becca, also skipping. Peck and Emily begin a tenuous relationship, mostly due to Peck's interest in her. They are worlds apart in savvy (she with much, he with none), but it's interactions with her and experiences in his classes that shape Peck's forced-upon science fair project, which, when presented, rocks the genuinely indifferent and platitude-numbed school system from its slumbering core.
A skinny high school sophomore dreams up a science project that will make him a living legend, and win him the heart of a pretty senior who sees his true potential. Michael Peck is the kid nobody sees while he's walking down the hall. But when popular senior Emily takes a liking to Michael, he starts to become a little less invisible. Meanwhile, Michael's well meaning yet misguided parents pressure him to enter the upcoming science fair - an event that could land him right back in the land of misfits. With his newfound popularity hanging precariously in the balance, the smart and stealthy teen dreams up a science project that will turn heads, and teach his parents a valuable lesson.
