Joe (Chow Yun Fat), a taxi driver who finds love when he accidentally hits someone with his taxi. The victim is May (Joey Wang), a sweet girl who walks with a limp due to one of her legs being longer than the other. Joe mistakenly thinks that he's crippled May for life, so to make it up to her he works for her family, helping them run their grocery store. Soon, he falls in love with May, but she's slow to return his affection. She'd better make up her mind quick, though, because her buxom, cousin (Nina Li Chi) has her eyes flirting on Joe, too!
