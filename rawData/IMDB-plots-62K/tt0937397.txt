RJ the raccoon produces a nature video, which turns out to be an excuse for him and the porcupine children to play pranks on Hammy the squirrel.
RJ, the aspiring racoon director, is bent on filming his own nature show--the ambitious, "RJ's Wild World of Nature"--starting off with Hammy, the American red squirrel, and his latest discovery: a crazy boomerang. However, the always mischievous porcupine triplets--Bucky, Spike, and Quillo--have other plans in mind, causing a hilarious set of adventures in the forest with the strange throwing stick. Isn't his footage great for the series' first episode?
