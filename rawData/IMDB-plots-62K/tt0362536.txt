Men and women hook up in different sections of a private resort.
Computer game designers Ethan (Glen Meadows) and Cole (Antonio Aguilar) take a working vacation at Paradise Sands Resort. Ethan is with his wife, Sarah (Beverly Lynne) and playboy Cole is footloose and fancy free, but both have sex on the brain. As Cole adds another notch to his conquest belt, Ethan pressures Sarah to fulfill one of his cherished fantasies. She agrees to a threesome with bodacious Sophie (Shauna O'Brien), but the next day Sophie turns out to be the slut who came to dinner. For starters, she lied about her relationship with sociopath Ray (Evan Kensington), a systems analyzer. It turns out that she's married to Ray, who expects a quid pro quid for borrowing his wife. Ethan refuses to steal Allegro Games' innovative design so that Ray can resell it, but Ray won't take no for an answer, turning up at Ethan's office and threatening to rape Sarah. Ethan hires a bone-breaker to intimidate Ray, who beats the crap out of the dude. Ethan hacks into Ray's criminal files and psychiatric records, looking for clues that might help him get rid of his nemesis, who suffers from both acrophobia and Attention Deficit Disorder.
