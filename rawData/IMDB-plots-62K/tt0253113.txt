This movie reunites the Seavers from the long running television series. When we last saw them Jason, Maggie, Ben, and Chrissy moved to Washington, while Mike stayed to work on his relationship with his girlfriend Kate, and Carol also remained behind. The movie begins with Jason practicing in Washington, Chrissy is a film student, Mike is married to Kate and is henpecked, Carol is now a corporate lawyer, and Ben is working for himself without much success. Maggie is working for an arrogant man who is running for Congress and is only doing it as a recreation. When they get into a disagreement, Maggie loses her job. Jason brings all the kids together for their anniversary. And it is there that one of Mike's adopted children encourages Maggie to run against her former boss, distressing everybody.
