One woman's strength and courage under the most extreme weather conditions.
Based on the true story of Dr Jerri Nielsen who contracted breast cancer during her one year outpost at the South Pole. Just as winter approached and everything is on lock down for 8 months with no flights available in and out of the Amundsen-Scott station, Dr Nielsen had to find a way to treat herself whilst enduring harsh weather conditions and limited medical resources.
