A shy girl fears and secretly desires a man who may be a serial killer
Mythili (Jyothika) has recurrent nightmares of being attacked by a serial killer. When she meets a man Mathan (Simbu) who looks like the serial killer in her dreams, she is at once horrified and attracted. Mathan does in fact fit the description of a man who prowls and kills "westernized" women in bars. When the net closes in on Mathan, Mythili is inadvertently sucked into the police investigation into the grisly murders. Simbu's first filmmaking venture makes watchable fare and is a significant departure from his earlier 'little superstar' series.
