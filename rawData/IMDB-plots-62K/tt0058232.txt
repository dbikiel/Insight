1961. Luxemburger Thomas Vlassenroot deserted the French Foreign Legion during the Algiers Putsch. His lieutenant, Fraser, initiated the desertion for the two of them, Fraser believing he could do more for the French working for an underground organization. However, Thomas readily admits that he no longer has any political motivations or affiliations, and thus is hiding out from the authorities in Algiers. Fraser offers him a proposition: help him kidnap Lyonais lawyer, Dominique Servet, who is in Algiers to defend two Algerian nationalists. Fraser will mastermind the job, but Thomas is required to help him both carry out the kidnapping, as well as stand guard over Dominique for one week. She is only one of two kidnap victims that will be held, each victim with a guard apiece, the other victim's guard being Amerio, a fellow member of Fraser's organization. Unlike Fraser and Amerio, Thomas does the job as a mercenary for pay: the F60,000 he needs to be able to get back home to Luxembourg. His want to go to Luxembourg is despite he not knowing if there is any future for him there, beyond going back to his childhood home, where his mother is taking care of his infant daughter. After the successful kidnapping and as the week progresses, Thomas feels compelled not only to assist Dominique, but also help her escape as he has fallen in love with her. He has to accomplish this task against the threat of Fraser and Amerio's watchful eyes. He is able to do so, but sustains a serious abdominal wound in the process. As a wounded Thomas tries to make his way back to Luxembourg, he has to elude Fraser and his colleagues. But Thomas may feel further compelled to reconnect with Dominique in Lyon. If he does, the question becomes what she will think in him doing so.
