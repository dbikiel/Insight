They are in the vehicle when the gangster gets in it to try to escape the police. During the chase, the gangster is killed, and through a strange clause in his will, Chuck and Ferdie inherit his tavern.They hire a bus to take them to the tavern, but the driver abandons them and the other passengers there and takes off with everyone's luggage. Unbeknownst to everyone, one of the passengers (Marc Lawrence) is a member's of the dead gangster's gang. He is there to search the tavern for a hidden stash of money. As the night wears on, strange things begin to happen, and the tavern appears to be haunted. Moose, the dead gangster, always claimed that he kept his money "in his head." More gangsters arrive looking for the money and they try to scare off the guests, but eventually fail. Ferdie eventually finds the money hidden in the head of a stuffed moose, and they use it to transform the tavern into a health resort and hire Ted Lewis and His Orchestra and The Andrews Sisters to headline.
