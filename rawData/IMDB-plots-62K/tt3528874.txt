Literal and creationist interpretation of the Bible is the fastest-growing branch of Christianity in the U.S. This film takes an in-depth look at the views of these Christians who reject Charles Darwin's theory of evolution--while also examining how Darwin handled the question of God himself as he developed his theory of natural selection in the mid-1800s. Featuring interviews with Darwin historians, biographers, ministers and creationist Christians, along with letters and writings of Darwin (voiced by actor Sam West), the film takes a balanced look at this 150-year-old debate.
