Inspired by the stories of the American writer Raymond Chandler, the classical hero is private detective Phil Marlowe, a romantic cowboy, who takes the law into his own hands in the rough prairie of a large city. He is honest, skeptical and hardworking. He toils away on the cases that he solves after numerous mistakes, while often being tormented and beaten up by criminals and even the police. In this world of violence, mistrust and corruption, everything is for sale. Everything except him.
