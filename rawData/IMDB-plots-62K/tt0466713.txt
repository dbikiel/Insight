The first German army comedy: Finally graduated from high school. Now what? The army? Basti has been dealt a jinxed hand: Despite his faked urine sample, he's found fit for service; even his conscientious objector's form goes astray. Before he knows what's hit him, Basti is dragged from his own party by military police and taken to barracks. Basti finds himself in basic training, with cropped hair, combat uniform, and a bunch of hopelessly chaotic weirdoes as bunkmates. And yet they've got to win the annual maneuver against the crack GIs from the neighboring US base .
