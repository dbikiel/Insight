In a future where most humans have moved underground to escape the pollution, one of the few pleasures left is a kind of narcotic in the form of chips which can be plugged directly into the brain. Lori, a female body guard steals a case of such chips and flees underground Los Angeles with Danner, a pleasure android so that they can smuggle the chips to New York. In pursuit is Plughead, a dangerous criminal so named because of the many sockets and ports which decorate his scalp so that he can test and use the chips that he is after.
In the future, the Earth has been transformed into a unbreathable wasteland where most of the ocean has dried up, and trees no longer grow on the surface, due to pollution. The human race is now living in underground cities beneath the surface. In L.A., former bodyguard Lori is pulled out of retirement when her former employer, Juice, hires her. Juice sells electronic narcotics "chips" to Plughead, a psychotic chip dealer who is more machine than man. When the deal goes wrong, Juice is killed in a undercover police operation. In possession of the chips, Lori hires a robotic gigolo named Danner to help her get from L.A. to New York, where she plans to sell the chips. They are pursued by Plughead and two clumsy police detectives, They travel across the unbreathable surface to New York City, as Plughead wants the chips for himself.
