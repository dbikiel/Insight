In the Camargue, France, a young boy bonds with a white haired horse that escaped from ranchers.
A boy comes across a white-haired wild horse in the Camargue. Ranchers seek to capture the horse, but it escapes. What will happen as the boy sets out to find the horse again? The film is set in the gorgeous landscape of the Camargue, a marsh area in the south of France where the river Rhone meets the Mediterranean Sea.
In the Camargue, France, ranchers go after wild horses led by a leader, "White Mane," which escapes capture time after time. A small boy who witnesses the horse's furious fight for its freedom makes friends with the horse after the trackers supposedly give him up to whomever can capture him. They change their minds when they see the boy has tamed him and take off after the horse again, with the boy on his back. Both boy and horse, fed up with the continual fight for freedom and peace, and the duplicity of men, head out to sea as the men plead with the boy to turn back. (Winner of the Cannes Grand Prize in category in 1953.)
Herds of wild horses roam the tidal marshes of the Camargue region of south coastal France. A white stallion with a long mane is the head of one such herd. Wranglers attempt unsuccessfully to capture this stallion, which does not like humans. Folco, a fisherboy, witnesses the attempted capture. He becomes obsessed himself with capturing the stallion. The stallion has a different reaction to Folco than other humans, but would much rather be with his herd than to be captured by anyone. As the wranglers and Folco individually try to capture the stallion, the stallion itself has a changing relationship to the rest of its herd and as a result to Folco himself.
