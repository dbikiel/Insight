In Wyoming, mountain trapper Yancy goes to the nearest town to trade his pelts but gets into trouble when he tries to save runaway saloon girl Rosalie from her shameful job.
Charming tale of mountaineer-trapper Murphy's first taste "big city" life with young, sweet Sandra Dee in tow. She flees her family, which tried to trade her for some of Murphy's beaver pelts, and tags along with the reluctant Murphy. They get into all manner of trouble in town, and Murphy has to shoot the sheriff to rescue Dee from her job as a dancehall girl.
