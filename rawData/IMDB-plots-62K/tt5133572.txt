After getting fired from her job as a maid at a ritzy New York City hotel, Allie reluctantly accepts a temporary gig as the governess to a young girl who is part of a powerful family in Europe that lives in a castle.
Allie Evans is a maid who just lost her job at a hotel for not getting a client's room prepared in time. She is then hired by a man named Fergus (who is working for a hotel patron that overheard what happened to her) where he invites her to the European country of Winshire to work as a governess for his employer. Upon arrival, Allie discovers that Fergus' boss is King Maximillian and meets his daughter Theodora who had been terrorizing other authority figures since the untimely death of her mother the Queen of Winshire. As Allie bonds with Theodora while getting acquainted to the other servants and Chancellor Riggs, she learns that King Maximillian is scheduled to be wed to Countess Celia.
King Maximilian of tiny European (fictitious) Winshire enjoys staying in New York, where ignorant commoners treat him as equal. When Allie Evans, covering for her sister during an audition hence unable to clean the hotel VUP suits, runs into him and sweetly tries to make up, he's charmed but her boss fires both siblings. Royal butler and confident Fergus notices she still honestly returns is master's left-behind watch and offers her a cash reward, which she declines despite dire need to pay for brilliant brother Aaron's studies, hen vets and hires her as umpteenth governess for the royal princess Theodora, an insufferable brat. While staff is divided about unconventional Allie, she gets trough to the motherless girl and clearly wins unprecedented royal favor, compromising the chancellor's plan to see Maximilian remarry his 'fitting' youth love Celia of Luxemburg.
