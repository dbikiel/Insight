Leanne "Pia Miranda" is training to be a teacher in 1971 Adelaide, but she is more interested in seeing life through the lens of her camera. To make matters worse, she has to suffer the indignities of living at home with her parents "Heather Mitchell and Marshall Napier". Her older sister Bronwyn "Sacha Horler" is finding it difficult to adjust to married life in remote Yallaroo with her husband Brian "Tamblyn Lord" and runs away. Then, visiting American hip poet Lou "Brett Stiller" comes to town, urging all to 'seek out the light'.The younger generation embraces the challenge enthusiastically, and Leanne's neighbor Gary "Tim Draxl" and her friend Debra "Anna Torv", are drawn to Lou.
