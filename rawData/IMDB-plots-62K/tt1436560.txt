A dark comedy which follows two brothers who are in love with the same woman.
In this tale of resentment, deceit, and sibling rivalry, two adult brothers, Rudy and Paul, represent failure and success. Younger brother Paul is a successful author who writes Harry Potter-like fantasy novels for children. The painful part is that Rudy, an aspiring writer, was Paul's original childhood collaborator on the stories. The one thing they do have in common is their love for Diana. Although Rudy is married to Diana, their divorce is impending-and he currently lives out of his car. Ever the opportunist, Paul makes his move on Diana.
