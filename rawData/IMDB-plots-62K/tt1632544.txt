A girl that resemble "Sadako" of the movie Ring is being feared by her classmates. She is avoided by everyone.While everyone is avoiding her, the popular boy Shota Kazehaya befriends her, and their love begins to grow.
Sawako Kuronuma is a young girl attending high school; all her life she has been shunned by other students because of her awkward, eerie presence. She reminds everyone of the character of Sadako from the horror movie "The Ring", and due to the similarity of her name she is stuck with the nickname "Sadako". It probably doesn't help that Sawako is so socially maladjusted that she seems to suffer from Asperger's Syndrome, but she is actually a very timid and caring person. She meets three other students who change her life, including her idol, Shota Kazehaya, an outgoing and happy boy who is everyone's favourite pal.
