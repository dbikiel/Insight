Meeting the right person at the wrong time can be the best thing that ever happened to you.
Meet Eliot Anderson and Jamie Thompson:
Masters of Prolonged Adolescence, experts in Self-Sabotage.Faced with the possibility of their true potential, at a time in life when they both know theyre supposed to be finding some kind of clarity the only sensible response seems to be running in the opposite direction.What a perfect time for them to meet.Eliot is a stand up with crippling anxiety, Jamie avoids life through partying and travel. When Jamie rides his bicycle into Eliots car their exchange is not exactly a meet-cute. More like a meet-fling-hostile-abuse-drive-off-aggressive.
Then when Eliot riffs on the exchange in her set that night and Jamie is there to see it, its game on, and the chemistry is undeniable.They push each others buttons. They fall in love. But just as they open themselves up and see they might be a fit, things start to fall apart. New job opportunities and family crises bring their issues and their future together into sharp focus and their respective modes of escape-therapy begin to fail them.Will they ever be able to get out of their own way, so they can truly come together?Interspersed with live stand up comedy from Beth Stelling, Ahmed Bharoocha, Katie Page and Will Weldon (who all also star), and featuring hilarious character turns from Anthony LaPaglia, Edi Gathegi, Mimi Rogers, Gia Carides and David Pasquesi, THIS ISNT FUNNY takes an honest, sharply observed look at meeting the right person at a time in your life when you just dont know what to do with it. And how it can be the best thing that ever happened to you.
