This DVD is a recording of the show Patton Oswalt performed in Athens, Georgia. It's a version of his Werewolves and Lollipops show, second solo album (also available on CD), and he ranges from talking about Kentucky Fried Chicken's famous bowls to his work as television writer (and how he has to come up with euphemisms for things inappropriate to talk about on television that end up being worse than what they're representing).
