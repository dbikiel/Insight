A father struggles with the past. A daughter fights for the future. A mother searches for answers. The Boyajians have not celebrated Christmas in 11 years. They lost their faith when they lost their son to the Persian Gulf War. Now a stranger has joined them - around the same age the boy would have been. Is he a con artist? Or is this young man the miracle their family has been waiting for. William Devane, Reagan Pasternak and Dean McDermott star in a remarkable story of loss and renewal. This Christmas, a stranger will change them forever.
