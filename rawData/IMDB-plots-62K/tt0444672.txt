Rick Robinson is a ladder-climbing law intern from Miami with four days until the Bar Exam. Desperate to score points with his boss (McAllister), he commits to a favor he can't afford. He ends up in a rundown truck headed to L.A. with his boss's possessions, his Hollywood-bound niece, and her pet pig. Amidst hitch-hikers, breakdowns, and assorted local yokels, Rick finds love, life and maybe himself in this trans-American road trip from hell.
Rick has a thankless job in corporate America. He is given, what he believes to be an upwardly mobile opportunity to advance his career. His boss, McAllister asks him to move his hot niece from Florida to California. Rick is supposed to take the Florida bar exam in three days. Hijinx ensue, and of course, Rick learns some valuable life lessons that cannot be learned from a book. Jon Heder appears in the second half of the film, and is funny, as always. I'd give this movie a thumbs up, but alas it has been done before. Save this one for cable, or if your under 20 (not an insult, might be fresh to the younger generation) go ahead and rent it. Oh, and Mila Kunis is well-acted and very charming as the hot niece.
