Comic genius shines through in Zero Mostel's brilliant and hilarious portrayal of Senor Carlos de Refugio, a wealthy landowner known for his roguish and selfish acts. Refugio's desire for the beautiful, young Alicia (Priscilla Garcia) so overwhelms him that he wrongfully accuses her fianc√©, Luis (A. Martinez), of stealing on of his prize ducks. Refugio refuses to forgive Luis until Alicia promises to marry him. Ignored by everyone in town, Refugio becomes convinced he is doomed to travel the earth as a wandering soul without home or friends. With sudden insight, Senor Refugio pardons Luis and makes amends for all the trouble he's caused. Luis and Alicia are married in a resplendent wedding ceremony which ends with a startling and inspirational revelation.
