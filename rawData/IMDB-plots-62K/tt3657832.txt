Far away from all civilization, Hinterdupfing is a rather dull Bavarian village which lives quite behind times. Smart phones are not known here and sporadically D-Mark is still used as a currency. By accident, tourists end up in Hinterdupfing and turn the village louts' heads. Hias, Schmei, Spoita and Vroni take up a trip to the nearest city and get to know a world completely new to them. Soon they decide to introduce this strange but exciting lifestyle to their home. By means of tourism they attempt to change Hinterdupfing into an attractive home. The plan succeeds more and more strangers come into the village. Nevertheless, the more tourists the bigger the problems that Hinterdupfing has to face. All hell is breaking loose...
