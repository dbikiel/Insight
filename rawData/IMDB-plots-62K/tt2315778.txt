The little Bunny did not obey his Hare mother and ate very badly. All the food that his mother was cooking for him, he secretly threw out the window, thereby fattening a big, fat, greedy Fly. The harmful Fly kidnapped him in order to blackmail his mother with the help of him. Having tied the little Bunny to the high tree, the Fly flies to his mother and makes her condition that the mother should feed the Fly like a little Bunny.
