Fifteen years ago, a group of men's lives were forever changed by a strange occurrence. Now, the same group of men will spend a night together ... in terror.
After a chance encounter at the ages of fifteen with a terrifying alien race, Wyatt, Cody, Duke and Otis are scarred by the death of their friend. Released from experimentation by the creatures, they go their separate ways. Fifteen years later, Cody, Duke and Otis have re-united; ardent in that revenge is the path to take. Wyatt, however, has ultimately decided to live with the past and has chosen a normal life with his wife Hope. Entwined to the fate of Duke, Cody and Otis when they manage to track down and capture a lone alien, Wyatt and Hope are now thrust into a new world of terror as the horrifying abilities of the creature become known. From hypnotizing Hope with a mere glance into her eyes to infecting Cody with a seemingly transmogrification-bound alien virus, the creature is out to wreak havoc upon its captors in any and all of its devious and insidious means. With no more than a few hours to decide between releasing the creature and forfeiting their lives, and killing the creature condemning the human race, Wyatt may just be the only hope for his friends and his species alike.
Fifteen years ago, five men were abducted by aliens. Only four returned. Now, these same four men have managed to capture one of the creatures who killed their friend and ruined their lives. It's time for payback but payback swings both ways.
