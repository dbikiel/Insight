A young couple's dream home turns into a house of horrors when the disturbing, violent acts of three generations of doomed families is reawakened for them to witness.
Newlyweds, Mike and Marisol, are given the tour of their potential dream home by a perky real estate Agent. They soon find out that their perfect house might just have a past. The ugly horrors of this house are revealed through three original tales of terror: "THE STORM" A Hitchcock inspired, dark shadow filled tale of an abusive family taking shelter in their basement from a violent, fast approaching storm. Soon we learn that the weather isn't the only thing threatening to tear this family apart.... "CHIC-KEN" Jason, Michael Myers and Freddy Krueger are all mythological perfect killing machines that still to this day terrorize our subconscious. But could the perfect serial killer truly exist? Maybe he's already been operating undetected for years. Maybe he's someone's next-door neighbor. Maybe even yours...... "DINNER GUEST" Overseas tourists and malcontents have been tortured and dismembered by sick sociopaths in puzzling ways many times over. These days you never know what can be the trigger that unleashes a brutal murderous attack. Infidelity? Revenge? Greed? Power? Maybe something as simple as forgetting to return that borrowed lawn tool can set someone off. You'll be sure to have all your affairs in order the next time you accept an invitation to be a "Dinner Guest"
