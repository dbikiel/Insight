Story of a friendship between an eccentric journalist and a daredevil barnstorming pilot.
In the 1930's, a First World War flying ace named Roger Schumann is reduced to making appearances on the crash-and-burn circuit of stunt aerobatics. His family are forced to live like dogs while Shumann pursues his only true love, the airplane. When Burke Devlin, a reporter, shows up on the scene to do a "whatever happened to" story on Shumann, he is repulsed by the war hero's diminished circumstances and, conversely, drawn to his stunning wife, LaVerne.
1932. The Flying Schumanns entourage - decorated Great War fighter pilot Roger Schumann, his daredevil parachutist wife LaVerne Schumman, mechanic Jiggs, and the Schumanns' now nine year old son Jack Schumann - travel the air show circuit, largely living off prize money won in air races. At their latest stop at the Delta Field Air Show in New Orleans, they are befriended by New Orleans Picayune reporter Burke Devlin, who, due to their tight finances, offers them accommodations in his small one bedroom apartment with him. Burke, covering the air show, wants to do a story on the nomadic lives of the pilots and their entourages traveling the air circuit, especially when he learns of the complex relationship between Roger, LaVerne and Jiggs, which is not always harmonious due to a long held issue, and despite LaVerne and Jack idolizing imperfect Roger. Burke, in getting involved personally with the Schumanns, adds an extra level of complexity to their already troubled family life, which is made even more complex with the involvement of businessman Matt Ord into their livelihood. What happens within this collective makes Burke further examine his work as a reporter, which he sees as not just stating the facts.
