A strange man owns a self-storage facility and lives in a reality of his own, until reality comes crashing down.
Jonathan Younger, a slick, cool and flashy owner of a self-storage business loves two things the most. His job - and female customers. His hardworking common-looking wife and business partner Penny does not approve of this at all and even fantasizes about killing him. One day, after flirting with a pretty customer, Jonathan hits a huge Wurlitzer organ (musical instrument) which releases a thundering sound that terrifies unsuspecting Penny and she instantly dies from a heart attack. Jonathan and his son Winston must now run their business together. Winston wants things to work, but series of quirky and annoying customers brings him to the edge of sanity. Meanwhile, Jonathan starts seeing Penny's ghost, but the more he sees her, the hotter and younger she looks. She is also as flirtatious as ever, so he falls in love with her all over again. Will Winston manage to save their business or will he completely lose it? Is Jonathan really seeing Penny or is he losing his mind completely?
