A teenager girl intrudes a quite couple's life.
Anna (Agnès Delachair), a young and adventurous teenage girl pretends to have a scooter breakdown to get into the life of Tristan (Jean-François Garreaud), a grizzled and austere lawyer, married to a still austere woman, Rachel (Guillemette Barioz). But the adulterous joke that pulls the Swiss man of fifty from his monotonous life turns short on the return of the deceived wife. Pale figure and drawn features, she strangely accommodates the presence of Anna, deeply hurt but fascinated by the young woman. The story takes a disconcerting slope by discovering the secret links that unite these three characters far from the creaky vaudevilles.
