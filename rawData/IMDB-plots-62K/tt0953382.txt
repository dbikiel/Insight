The children of a small European mountain village end up being its only residents, soon after the adults cannot take their behavior any longer.
Welcome to Timpelbach, a small, serene village. Well, not really that serene... Indeed, for several weeks, the children have been playing multiple practical jokes and nasty tricks. The victims are, of course, other children... but also, and most of all, the parents. Overwrought, they decide to leave the village for what they think will only be one day. But nothing happens as planned: on the way back, they are taken prisoner by a group of soldiers. In Timpelbach, the news of a village without parents makes Oscar and his gang of thugs happy! But that isn't the case of a few daredevils who decide to side with Manfred and Marianne to regain control of the village.
In small (German or Alsatian) town Timpelbach, the school kids are prone to pranks, addresses at each-other (especially forming two gangs), family, the incompetent village school staff and even animals. Feeling unable to regain control, the adults force the mayor to declare the state of emergency and collectively leave town, declaring by note the youth must indefinitely see to themselves, and are unable to return as rogue general Igor captures the self-exiled column. Thus bully gang leader Oscar is delighted to be rid of his abusive father and expects to install a reign of terror over all, but gets unexpectedly efficient opposition from Manfred and fellow animal lovers.
