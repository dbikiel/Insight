Two journalists are on the trail of a demented serial killer who may be much closer than they think.
After being accused of crimes he did not commit, a lonely circus performer exacts his revenge on those who unjustly condemned him. The act sparks something inside of him which he cannot stop and now, years later, his inner-demons have truly surfaced. Part urban legend, part tabloid sensationalism... he is now an unstoppable murderous juggernaut, fueled only by hate.
When ambitious investigative reporters Mark Webb (Joe Davison) and Jennifer Stevenson (Georgia Chris) get a hot tip about the identity of a serial killer, they see it as their big break and set their sights on infiltrating a community of carnival performers to get the scoop. Unfortunately for them, their search lands them in the hands of the bloodthirsty psychopath, and soon, they find themselves at the center of their own horrifying story.
