Reluctantly, a sulky adolescent returns to her parents' house for yet another boring summer vacation, dabbling in desire and the art of desirability, eventually mixing reality with vision, caged fantasies with the fierce female sexuality.
Reluctantly, only child Alice Bonnard, a sulky and curious adolescent, returns to her parents' provincial farm house for yet another boring and endless end-of term vacation from boarding school, in the summer of 1963. Sadly, what awaits her there is a farce of a happy family, a strenuous generation gap, lonely outings with her bicycle and an awkward and clumsy transcendental stage between a girl's puberty and a young woman's adolescence. Nevertheless, as if by instinct, Alice the unripe explorer of her budding sexuality, she will find herself infatuated with Jim, a masculine pouting workman in her father's saw mill, dabbling in desire and the art of desirability, self-exploration and autoeroticism as an antidote to boredom. Eventually, young Alice mixing reality with vision, sexual fantasies and the fierce caged female sexuality with every visceral fluid possible, the undefined boundaries of the unfathomable realm of sex become ever so slightly clear, under an immature life's bubbly French Pop soundtrack.
August, 1963; Alice, 14, an only child, and physically well developed, is home for vacation. She's moody, silent, keeps a diary, and explores tactile sensations with broken eggs, candle wax, ear wax, vomit, urine, blood, and, perhaps, if the summer goes in one very possible direction, semen. Without her underpants, she walks about, rides her bike, and sits on the shore as the tide comes in. She drifts to her father's sawmill and makes eyes at Jim, a 20-something hand with a lean body and a model's face. What will Jim do, and does Alice want to do more than stare and fantasize? Meanwhile, pop music fills the air and the TV screen, and Alice's parents have their own drama.
