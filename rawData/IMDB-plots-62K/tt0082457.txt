When his father - who owned a circus - dies, Foster inherits 5 million dollars - and 3 orangutans. However there's a condition connected to the money: if he gives away the orangutans or just one gets sick or dies during the next 3 years, the zoological society will get all the money. So he not only has to deal with 3 apes and an annoyed girlfriend, but also with Laszlo, a kooky new roommate who came from the circus to help with the apes, a greedy zoological society's president, 3 bumbling henchmen and a cranky landlord.
