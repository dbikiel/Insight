Both entertaining and educational, "How Not to Make a Movie" chronicles how the Red Letter Media guys all met and started making movies together, which lead to the disasterous production of the 2003 feature film collaboration Gorilla Interrupted (2003). "How Not to Make a Movie" also shows the restoration process of remastering this ancient schlock no budget flop.
