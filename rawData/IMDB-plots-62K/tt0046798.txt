Francois Roques, a power-and-money-mad editor of a Paris newspaper (who justifies his actions by calling attention to his poverty-stricken childhood), invites four women to a housewarming at his penthouse apartment. He plans on one of them to meet death by means of a loose railing on the balcony. The invitees are: Constance, Francois' first wife, whose love and integrity also stood in the way of his schemes; Vera Volpone, his second wife, from whom he is seeking a divorce, and who, with the aid of her lover, is blackmailing Ffancois; Maggy, his mistress who aids him in his illegal transactions; and Cecile, his fianc√©e, who is pregnant by another man. The women arrive, tension overwhelms them and the host, three of the women depart...and Francois is alone with his intended victim. Despite a misleading Review/Comment on this site-page, the keyword is "intended."
