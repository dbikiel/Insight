Non-linearly follows two kids, rejected by their peers, who become friends. They separate later in life and dedicate to their careers. Still, they feel as if something is missing.
Alice and Mattia, two exceptional personalities but inadequate, synthesis of two lives in pain, two special people who travel on the same track, but are two worlds imploded, unable to open up to the world. One fully understands the feelings of the other, but is never able to express them out loud, in short, they are two prime numbers. Prime numbers are divisible only by 1 and themselves.
