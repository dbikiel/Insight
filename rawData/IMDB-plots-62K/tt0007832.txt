An alcoholic checks into a health spa and his antics promptly throw the establishment into chaos.
Charlie goes to a spa to dry out, but he takes a trunk of liquor with him. He tangles with another's gouty foot in a revolving door. Later he thinks the gouty man is making love signs to him (he doesn't Edna, the real object of the man's efforts), so he signs back. He interpets a massage to be a wrestling match. When management throws his liquor into the fountain, when flow the healthful waters, everyone gets drunk.
Charlie goes to a health resort to overcome his liking for liquor. His baggage consists of a trunk full of booze, a collar, toothbrush and shirt. He meets Edna and falls in love with her. The hotel proprietor discovers the trunk full of booze and throws it out of the window, the contents landing in the well. Chaplin finds all of the hotel patrons at the well, drinking freely of the water and feeling very gay. He and Edna join the crowd and the result is that all of the hotel guests become intoxicated and a fine time ensues.
Charlot is an alcoholic and gets a suitcase full of alcohol in a sanatorium. The director discovers alcohol, which makes throwing out but ending up in water, which has strange effects: patients dance in the sanatorium until they stagger. The following day he reveals to Charlot that the water is full of alcohol and Charlot falls into the pool.
Chaplin is a wealthy inebriate drying out at a sanitarium when his secret liquor stash gets dumped in the mineral spring. Among many outstanding scenes is Charlie's effort to avoid the joint-wrenching massage therapy of his long-time sidekick, Henry Bergman.
