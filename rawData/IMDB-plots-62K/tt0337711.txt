The Rugrats get tangled in an exotic adventure, where they're helped by the Thornberrys, a family that travels the world making nature documentaries.
The Rugrats and family become stranded on an island, and Stu Pickles (Jack Riley) is blamed. The kids wander off into the jungle, and Spike (Bruce Willis) loses his sense of smell due to sneezing. This becomes a problem when a clouded leopard named Siri (Chrissie Hynde) finds out about the babies and goes after them, and the situation only gets worse when the kids become trapped underwater with an amnesic Nigel Thornberry (Tim Curry), losing oxygen fast.
