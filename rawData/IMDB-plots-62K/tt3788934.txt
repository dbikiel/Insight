A sociopolitical metaphor of the world as a formal dinner that takes an unexpected turn when there's no more food to be served.
During dinner the system is working like a well-oiled machine. It constantly and solely feeds the few that foolishly consume all the resources while the rest survive on what little falls off the table. Inevitably when the supply is depleted the struggle for what's left leads to a catastrophic change. Sadly the offspring of this profound transition turns out to be not a sign of hope but the spitting image of the parents. The film is a sociopolitical allegory of our society.
In a ramshackle building (suggesting a capitalist country), there live a herd of pigs: judges, capitalists, journalists, etc. They are having dinner, and a strong man turns different furniture into delicious food through a machine. (Suggesting that social law converts social resources into capital for the elite) There is a group of cats below (grassroots people) .Begging for food from the pigs. As time went on, the furnishings in the room were exhausted. The pigs began to rob the food. (When the social resources are exhausted, the elite begins to rob the resources.) When the cat is noisy under the table, he accidentally enters the bottom of the table and finds that several cables have locked the pigs, and no one can escape! Finally, when the resources were exhausted, the cats ran out of food and began to resent, so the cats began to gather their strength and become a tiger! (popular revolution) tigers kill and eat pigs. Blood streamed everywhere. When the tiger was full and began to nap, the man who fed the pig killed the tiger and took the cat out. The cats went into another room, some of them turned into pigs, distributing tableware with joy. The cat is begging for food on the ground again. (New society arises, new classes emerge)
