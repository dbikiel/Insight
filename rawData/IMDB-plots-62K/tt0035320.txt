Miss Winters is a dancer with the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra and is asked to secretly transport a prototype magnetic mine to Puerto Rico. She thinks that she is working for the US Government, but fails to see why she would be involved. The enemy agents got the plan from a pulp novel written by Kibble, who is also on the ship and falls for her. But then she overhears his new novel and believes that he is talking about her. So when they leave the boat, she ignores him, but somehow, the bags get switched and he gets the magnetic mine - which she must later retrieve. It is mainly a Tommy Dorsey showcase with Sinatra singing - Powell dancing - and a small plot.
Writer Merton K. Kibble (Red Skelton), on the verge of a nervous breakdown, decides to take a cruise. His Man Friday, Skip (Bert Lahr), gets the tickets, picking Puerto Rico because that's the destination of a troupe of pretty girls. Hypochondrfiac Merton is shaken out of his doldrums when he meets Tallulah Winters (Eleanor Powell), star of the dance troupe. She has little time for Merton, as she is carrying a government secret. Or at least thinks she is. Actually she is the dupe of spies and is delivering a magnetic mine to the enemy agents. She slips it into Merton's suitcase and recovers it ashore. At a show on the ship, Tallulah realizes she has been duped. While trying to reach U.S. agents, the spies have cornered them.
