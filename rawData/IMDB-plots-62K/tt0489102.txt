A young boy named Hikora enters the ruins of a forbidden city with a group of other children to play "Otokoyo" (a game of hide-and-seek where the players are said to be kidnapped by ghosts and demons) to find his missing sister.
In a street where no one lives, there is a rumor saying that if you play the game 'Otokoyo', or hide and seek after dark, demons will come and take you away. One night, 8 children play the game, each for their own reasons. A boy named Hikora has joined in search of his missing sister who played the game last. But when the game does begin, it becomes apparent that the rumors were true, and that children do get taken away, and Hikora discovers the fate of the one who is "it".
