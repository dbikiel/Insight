With the police hot on their trail, Stan and Ollie attempt to change clothes in their getaway car, only to find themselves struggling to balance atop the girders of an unfinished skyscraper. Will they return to ground level in one piece?
Two escaped convicts (Laurel &amp; Hardy) change clothes in the getaway car, but wind up wearing each other's pants. The rest of the film involves their trying to exchange pants, in alleys, in cabs and finally high above the street on the girders of a construction site.
With the police hot on their trail, the jail-breaking duo, Stan and Ollie, attempt a rushed change of clothes in the confined space of their getaway car, only to find themselves in yet another fine mess, wearing each other's pants. As a result--to escape from the unbearable humiliation of having to swap trousers in public--the fresh prison escapees will soon wind up twenty stories high, struggling to balance atop the narrow girders of an unfinished skyscraper. However, they are not alone, as a furious adversary is bent on taking his revenge. Will the boys return to ground level in one piece?
