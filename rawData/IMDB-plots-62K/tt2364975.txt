Three girls in 1980s Stockholm decide to form a punk band -- despite not having any instruments and being told by everyone that punk is dead.
In early-80s' Stockholm, Bobo, an ordinary thirteen-year-old schoolgirl who lives with her divorced mother, takes inspiration from bands like KSMB and Ebba Gr√∂n, refusing to accept what others say about Punk being dead. Sharing the same taste in music with her classmate, Klara, and with the help of the talented but introverted eighth-grader, Hedvig, the girls decide to put a band together, getting their hands on musical instruments for the very first time. But, surprisingly, what started as a joke, will soon become a reality--and with a song already in their hands--this aspiring Punk band fuelled by youthful rebellion, will aim for the stars without any concern about what others say, simply because THEY ARE THE BEST.
