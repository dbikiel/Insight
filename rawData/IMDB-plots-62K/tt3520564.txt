The film recounts the story of a young couple on their way to Melbourne to continue their studies. However, just a few hours before the departure of their flight, they are unintentionally involved in a tragic event.
Amir and Sara are a young couple from Tehran about to leave for Australia to continue their studies in Melbourne. But a few hours before their plane leaves they find themselves in an unforeseen drama. They neighbors' babysitter is gone and she has left the baby at their charge. In the hustle of preparing for the trip they don't realize that the baby is not actually sleeping on their bed but that it's not breathing because it's dead. What was to be a simple favor becomes a never ending nightmare. Amir and Sara's actual trip starts far from their airport, at their own place. Their apartment, half empty and without personal touches, becomes a claustrophobic purgatory, an actual existential crossroad.
Hours before leaving Tehran for a three-year stay in Melbourne, young couple Amir (Peyman Moaadi) and Sara (Negar Javaherian) find themselves looking after a neighbour's newborn, left to them by the nanny. However, this well-meaning favour soon turns tragic and threatens to derail more than just their plans to move abroad. Unfolding in real-time and almost entirely within a Tehran apartment, this psychological drama patiently burrows to the heart of its moral dilemma, where doing the right thing may in fact be the very worst choice for this well-meaning couple. Assisted by excellent performances, intimate cinematography and expert editing, 'Melbourne' is a compellingly universal and thoroughly engrossing movie. A very tense thriller not to be missed.
