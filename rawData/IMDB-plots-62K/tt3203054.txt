Forty-seven brief but vivid vignettes about the paradoxical nature of our world, seamlessly intertwine perplexing scenes of poetical absurdism with the ironic, the grotesque, and the beautiful. Is this the symphony of life?
The film applies an unconventional narrative. It presents a subjective world through 47 scenes. The small events, interlaced by associations, express the irrational coherence of our surroundings. The surreal situations are based on the interactions of humans and nature.
The film presents 47 observations in the irrational connections between human and nature. The film applies an unconventional narrative. It presents a subjective world through 47 scenes. Small events, interlaced by associations, express the irrational coherence of our surroundings. The surreal situations are based on the interactions of humans and nature. Differences between human and animal diminish, everyone is doing their jobs and leaving traces. Every small movement affects another, building an unpredictable, irrational system.
Integrating forty-seven brief but vivid vignettes with the paradoxical nature of our world, the Hungarian filmmaker, RÃ©ka Bucsi, intertwines perplexing scenes of poetical absurdism with the ironic, the grotesque, and the beautiful. With this in mind--and always pivoting around man's intense and catalytic link with the natural world--the complex vulpine drama of a sad being seamlessly coexists with Selkie intimacy, as the frozen in time tiger shark from Damien Hirst's 1991 masterpiece, "The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living" is in the making. Is this the symphony of life?
