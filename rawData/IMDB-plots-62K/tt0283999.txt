Two professional solo climbers form an uneasy partnership after a successful rescue mission grants them the gift of a lifetime.
In this intense ice-and-snow mountain drama, two climbers temporarily forced together for a rescue mission find themselves as uneasy partners in the adventure of a lifetime. Derrick Williams (Jason George) is a hotshot climber who wants to prove to the world he can do it himself. Teamed up with Christian "Safety-Man" Michael Harris (Ned Vaughn), another stunning professional world-class climber, they are given a fully funded ascent up one of the most deadly mountains in the world; the monstrous Mt. Chicanagua in the Chilean Andes. The battle doesn't begin on the slopes however, it is a test of wills, a question of faith and beliefs that begins immediately and doesn't stop until the stunning conclusion.
