Roscoe and Buster operate a combination garage and fire station. In the first half they destroy a car left for them to clean. In the second half they go off on a false alarm and return to find their own building on fire.
In this Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle and Buster Keaton's fourteenth and last film together, Fatty, and his willing assistant, Buster, work as automotive mechanics who double as fearless volunteer firemen. During one fateful day--as a neglectful customer discovers the virtue of tipping, and Buster gets to know better Luke the Dog's mighty mandible--an ambitious Casanova who dreams of dating the boss' daughter, Molly, finds himself in an awful predicament. All of a sudden, a frantic fire starts devouring the fire station. Who is behind the firehouse's inexplicable arson?
