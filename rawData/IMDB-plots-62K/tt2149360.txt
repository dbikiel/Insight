A horror-obsessed boy discovers his older brother is a serial killer.
Based on the novel by Todd Rigney, "Found" centers around Marty, a shy, bullied fifth-grader who takes refuge in horror films... until his life turns into one. After finding a human head in his brother's closet, Marty fears for the safety of his family while making a desperate effort to reconnect with Steve, the big brother whose homicidal cravings threaten to destroy life as Marty knows it.
Marty is the ideal fifth grader. He gets good grades, listens to his teachers, and doesn't start trouble in class. But a darkness is beginning to fall over Marty's life. The kids at school won't stop picking on him, his parents just don't seem to understand him, and now Marty must grapple with a terrible secret that threatens to destroy life as he knows it -- his big brother is a serial killer. Brotherly love is put to the ultimate test in this emotional coming-of-age story that descends into unspeakable horror.
As if his life wasn't complicated enough, the bullied twelve-year-old horror-movie aficionado, Marty, makes a horrifying discovery: undeniably, his big brother, Steve, is a real-life serial killer. Now, Marty not only has to endure the relentless bullying at school and his neglectful parents, but also he has to deal with Steve's horrible secret--a terrible discovery that threatens to alter, irreparably, his already messed-up life. For his young age, Marty has seen many horror movies; however, none of them matches the raw brutality of the film called Headless (2015) in his violently protective brother's hidden VHS collection. Does this astounding revelation explain Steve's motives?
