Two American brothers chased by a posse cross into Canada and join the Canadian North-West Mounted Police at the height of the Sioux-American war.
Brothers Dick and Carey Ross, eluding the law because of Carey's disregard for laws,cross over the Canadian border from Montana, and join the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. They react in different ways with Dick becoming an honest and standout member of the Mounties while Carey resorts to his old ways. The attempt by Chief Sitting Bull to incite the Canadian Indians to war is also woven into the threadbare version - number-231 good brother vs. bad brother plot.
