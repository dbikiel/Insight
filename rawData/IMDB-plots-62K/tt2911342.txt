Lambert joins the Dragon Slayers' League to save Altera from the Black Dragon.
The land of Altera has observed an uneasy peace for years among Humans, Elves and Evil beasts who are loyal to the legendary Black Dragon. But the Black Dragon begins to stir from its hibernation, sending the Beasts marching across Altera. With a beast conquest perilously close, a small group of Humans and Elves unite to try to find a secret hidden road to the Black Dragon's cave and destroy it. But the fate of all of them may be in the hands of the young warrior Lambert, who must summon the confidence and skill to face the Black Dragon himself just when all may be lost.
50 years ago, Black Dragon appeared in the once peaceful land of Lagendia. Under the order of the King, the young Geraint, Argenta, Velskud and other legendary heroes assembled various forces to form the Dragon Slaying Alliance. This incident was widely referred as the First Dragon Invasion by the generations to come. However, what exactly happened during this incident? Where are these heroes after the dragon invasion? The movie will reveal the story and mysteries behind this epic historical event.
