When God created man, his first try at it wasn't very successful... Fantozzi was born, and right from the beginning of time he was doomed to be humiliated and laughed at. In a number of episodes we follow the unlucky adventures of the various descendants of Fantozzi through time, from the moment they are thrown out of the Garden of Eden to the Space Age of the future.
