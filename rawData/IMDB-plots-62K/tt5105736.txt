As pioneers of the Dirty South music movement, Organized Noize is responsible for Outkast, CeeLo, the Goodie Mob and the Dungeon Family. Their production shaped the landscape of hip-hop with their own distinctive sound, created in the confines of a dungeon. Featuring interviews with Andre 3000, Big Boi, Puff Daddy, Future, Ludacris, L.A. Reid, 2 Chainz, CeeLo and more, this is the story of the rise and fall of music's most prolific unsung heroes. From Flavor Unit and the producers of Lil Wayne's "The Carter" documentary, this is the Art of Organized Noize.
