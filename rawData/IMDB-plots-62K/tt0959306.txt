A self-help book changes the lives of different people in the LA area. Who is the reclusive writer?
A motivational book written by a mysterious man quickly gains popularity, inspiring a group of people that includes a journalist, his editor, a former inmate, a hip-hop mogul, an actor and an undercover cop to re-evaluate their choices and decisions by confronting their fears in hopes of creating more positive lives.
An uplifting, feel-good movie, GLAD ALL OVER is an ensemble piece that centers around a new motivational book called Reach, and its reclusive Californian author who refuses to come out of hiding. The slim paperback is gaining momentum on the Internet and is affecting an odd cross-section of rough-edged characters who come in contact with it and each other. Among them: an undercover cop addicted to shooting bad guys - the Priest who counsels him who has his own demons - the dim-witted mobster trying to convince his partner to quit the business - the woman just released from prison for burning down her ex-husbands house and the online tabloid journalist determined to locate the secluded author and write an expose that will jump-start his own stalled writing career.At the end of GLAD ALL OVER every one of these characters and more collide on the Santa Monica pier at a rally for the author of Reach, Teddy Raymond. Teddy comes out, and after all hell breaks loose, everyones lives have been changed for the better.
