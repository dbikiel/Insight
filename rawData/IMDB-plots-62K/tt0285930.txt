January 13, 2001. Times war photographer Harvey Jacobs is wounded while witnessing a massacre at Nuevo Colon by terrorists. In a desperate effort, the United Nations sends a vehicle to get him out, a BMW driven by the mysterious Driver.
This gritty, action short opens with a shot of people being massacred in a cornfield by Columbian terrorists. Harold Jacobs, (Stellan Skarsg√•rd) escapes death, but is wounded by a bullet to the gut. He is next seen in the home of locals who tend to his wound and put him into a car that will take him across the border. A car follows. While traveling the countryside, Harvey reveals to the driver that he is a war photographer who has photographed the atrocities of 15 wars. He laments that people always ask him for help, but all he can do is take their picture. He senses his impending death, unloads the film from his camera and gives the film and his dog tags to the driver (Clive Owens) with a request to get the film to his boss at the New York Times and the dogtags to his mother. At the border, a dispute between border patrol and Harvey takes place, and the driver makes a successful run for the border through a field. Shots are fired with the result that Harvey is killed. The driver fulfills his duty and the film ends with the driver delivering the braille dog tags to Harvey's blind mother.
