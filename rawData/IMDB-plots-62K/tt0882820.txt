The story of Camila, a young woman intent on becoming a writer.
Camila (Leandra Leal) has a great passion; writing . Intense and courageous, she seeks to create for herself an existence complex enough that she can write about it. She writes compulsively on a blog, but this also makes her isolated and can only see two options in life: to kill or find the great love - whichever comes first.
