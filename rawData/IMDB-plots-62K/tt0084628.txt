A woman narrates the contemplative writings of a seasoned world traveler, focusing on contemporary Japan.
"He wrote me...." A woman narrates the thoughts of a world traveler, meditations on time and memory expressed in words and images from places as far-flung as Japan, Guinea-Bissau, Iceland, and San Francisco.
Director Chris Marker takes the viewer on a world tour of sorts where he is able to talk about his own world view. Part travelogue and part philosophical discourse, the footage was short mostly in Japan. Interesting imagery complements the views he presents and there is a memorable trip to San Francisco where he visits many of sites found in his favorite film, Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958).
