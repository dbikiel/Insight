Mba Angono, narrates his experience on the expedition (1944-1946) with H.Sanjuan, film director through the spanish colonial Guinea in search of 10,000 elephants.
Spanish filmmaker Manuel Hernández Sanjuán was drawn to colonial Africa by rumours of a mysterious lake where it was said lived 10,000 elephants. He hired a young guide, Guinean Angono Mba. 70 years later Angono relives their journey. Carefully crafted through animation, photographs, and Manuel's footage, One Day I Saw 10,000 Elephants is both a magical tale of the power of myths and a raw account of the realities of life under colonialism.
