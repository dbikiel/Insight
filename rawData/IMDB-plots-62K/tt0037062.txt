A idealistic shipyard worker interests a beautiful Hollywood star in staging a musical tribute to the war industry, but they disagree on some important issues.
Shipyard worker Bill Swanson writes a wartime play celebrating the American spirit. He meets theatre actress Julie Hampton, visiting the shipyard on a bond drive, and convinces her to read his patriotic opus. Enthusiastic at its potential, Julie is able to get the show produced, but Bill is dismayed when he discovers that its being turned into a musical. Withdrawing his option, he returns to his day job, but Julie isn't to be put off so easily.
