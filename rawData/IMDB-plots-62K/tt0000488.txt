A young boy, opressed by his mother, goes on an outing in the country with a social welfare group where he dares to dream of a land where the cares of his ordinary life fade.
Thanks to the Fresh Air Fund, a slum child escapes his drunken mother for a day's outing in the country. Upon arriving, he and the other children are told a story about a mythical land of no pain. Rather then return to the slum at day's end, the lad seeks to journey to that beautiful land beyond the sunset.
Little Joe's grandmother, a drunken old hag, beats and abuses him when he fails to bring her sufficient money with which to replenish her supply of liquor. A settlement worker has given Joe a free ticket to a seaside excursion and picnic given by the Fresh Air Fund. What a day it was. Joe actually walked upon the grass without being driven off. He romped and played with the hundred other waifs until they were called to lunch. And then the fairy story, the first he had ever heard. The soft voice of his pretty chaperon added greatly to the story and Joe's imagination began to work. But alas. The setting sun proclaimed it time to return to the city; the glorious day was at an end but not for little Joe. His chaperon had laid the book down at his very feet and now bustled about getting her charges ready for departure. Joe picked it up; the story all came back. He walked along the beach toward the setting sun. He found a boat without oars and not a soul in sight. A look at the book and the thought of his hovel called "home" helped him to make up his mind. His fairies had guided him to the shore and sent him a boat into which he climbed; he needed no oars because his fairy friends guided the boat and so he sailed out to sea, along the path of shining light to the land beyond the sunset.
