A German high school kid has his dick talking to him. Its advice keeps getting Flo into trouble. His friend has plans on how Flo can get his dream girl.
After the eye-opening events in Harte Jungs (2000), Florian is only one week away from graduation. Once more, the talkative part of his teenage anatomy gets him neck-deep into trouble, rendering Flo unable to control neither his ever-growing attraction to the opposite sex nor to stop embarrassing himself. As a result, Flo's best friend, Red Bull, comes to the rescue, and he has a brilliant plan to help his love-smitten companion get the girl of his dreams: the beautiful, Maja. Will Florian get Maja's attention? Will his "best friend" stop trying to help?
