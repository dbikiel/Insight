After an Algerian informant is murdered, two female investigators are sent to investigate.
Farid, an Algerian turned informant for the French police, is found murdered in a small French town. Two offbeat and unethical female investigators (a fercely authoritarian Isabelle Huppert paired with an inquisitive and voyeuristic Sandrine Kimberlain) are brought in to investigate the possibility of police involvement with the murder. Meanwhile the seemingly degenerate cop with a heart of gold, Mendes, acquires an eager, albeit naive Algerian informant, Younes, who quickly gets into trouble. Serge Bozon's TIP TOP is a sharp and witty absurdist political farce that will leave audiences with more questions about modern day France than answers.
