For the chance of seeing their teacher's "oppai". They took the challenge to win the volleyball tournament.
What induces a bunch of unmotivated and lazy loaf-about students to step up their game and begin competing? Why, the teacher's breasts of course. When the ultra-cute Terashima Mikako (Haruka Ayase) is assigned as the advisor for the Boys' Volleyball Club she finds a group of boys who not only don't have sufficient numbers to form a volleyball team to even begin practicing, but also that they have neither played a match nor even care to. What would make the difference to these young men? Giving them what they want to see.
