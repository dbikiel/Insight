The true story about an eccentric chicken farmer (Shane Jacobson) who, with the help of his granddaughter, trains his mischievous dog Oddball to protect a wild penguin sanctuary from fox attacks and in the process tries to reunite his family and save their seaside town.
In the early 2000's there was a thriving Little Penguin colony on Middle Island. Over a number of years foxes began to swim over and kill the penguins. So the Warnambool Coastcare Landcare Group took charge, hence The Middle Island Maremma Project began in 2006. Little Penguins on Middle Island where declining due to fox predation. Maremma Guardian dogs were trained and placed on Middle Island to protect the penguins from foxes. Hence this is where Oddball comes into it and saves the penguin's where he is a very mysterious and naughty dog back on land so this is his second chance to prove that he is a good dog.
