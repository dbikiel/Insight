Five years after throwing a killer party and stealing Muffin away from alpha-male Zeta frat member Bud, head party nerd Ritchie is married (to Muffin!) and runs a detective agency.
ASSAULT OF THE PARTY NERDS 2: THE HEAVY PETTING DETECTIVE picks up the story five years later when the Party Nerds are out of college. It's bigger, better and faster, with even more Partynerdum than the original! Back this time are Linnea Quigley, Michelle Bauer and Richard Gabai, joined this time by Burt Ward (TV's BATMAN), Arte Johnson (LAUGH-IN), Rhonda Shear (UP ALL NIGHT), and legendary sexy siren Tane McClure.
