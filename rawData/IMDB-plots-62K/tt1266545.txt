A traumatized child becomes a Naxalite, and upon being captured must agree to become a police-assassin.
After witnessing his entire Bhagpur, Bihar-based family being killed by Thakur Mahendra Pratap Singh, a traumatized and injured Chandrama Singh wakes up in a hospital, is adopted by Naxal leader, Baba, and grows up to become one himself. Years later, after killing Ramji Mahto, the police kill Baba, while Chandrama is hospitalized after being shot. When he recovers, he is told by Officer Vijayraj Kapur that he must agree to become a police-assassin or be killed in an 'encounter'. Chandrama agrees and undergoes vigorous training in all combat aspects along with 29 others for over 3 years. He then re-locates to Mumbai, and lives with another assassin, Arjun Tiwari, his mother, and falls in love with a school-teacher, Shubhi, while carrying out a wide variety of assassinations against 'anti-nationals'. Chandrama's only goal is to locate and kill Mahendra while Arjun wants to retire and re-locate to his home-town in Sultanpur. With increasing pressure of marriage from a pregnant Shubhi, Chandrama will find his life changing even more after Arjun gets killed by the police, and he is instructed that he cannot kill Mahendra - who is very influential - and is all set to become a Member of Parliament.
Chandrama Singh alias Chamku is raised by Baba, a Naxal leader, in the southern interiors of Bihar, after his family was brutally murdered. He later gets picked up under a covert Governmental program jointly conceived by RAW and Intelligence Bureau to carry out political assassinations. He falls in love with Shubhi, a kindergarten teacher and decides to lead a reformed life but a chanced encounter entangles him in the world of crime once again.
