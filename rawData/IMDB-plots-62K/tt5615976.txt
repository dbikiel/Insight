When a small-town boy's video Promposal goes viral, it scores him a Prom date with his celebrity crush. Complications arise when the celebrity falls for the boy's teacher.
David Rogers, a senior at J.W. Hughes High School in Arlington Heights, Illinois, does not run among the popular kids but aspires to do so, he wanting to make a name for himself before graduation. Exhausting all the popular girls as potential prom dates, most who don't even know who he is, he comes across the idea to make a prom-posal video to ask his favorite Hollywood actress, Alex Allen, to be his date. Using the stolen words from a published book of poetry by his English teacher Vincent Walsh, David is able to secure that prom date with Alex. In reality, Alex was convinced by her friend and publicist Paige Sumner, as Alex needs some positive publicity after a recent incident on the red carpet which not only led to the break-up with her leading man and boyfriend Colin Hartling - she coming to the conclusion that he was just the latest to use her to get ahead in the business - but movie producers now not wanting to hire her. Alex and Paige find that David unwittingly has his own people who will make sure that Alex does not hurt him in the process, namely his younger sister Devyn Rogers who could be his publicist if she wanted, and David's best friend since the first grade, Heidi Watts, who is secretly hurt that she was the one girl David did not ask to the prom. In the process of the getting ready for the prom, Alex may find that she has her own idea of a new leading man in her life, namely Mr. Walsh, who had no idea who Alex was before her arrival into the midst of J.W. Hughes. However, some people may have their own motive in ensuring that Alex and Vincent do not become an item, at least in the lead-up to prom.
