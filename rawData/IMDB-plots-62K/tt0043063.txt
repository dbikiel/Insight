Donald's peaceful day in the forest gets rather disturbed by Chip and Dale.
Chip and Dale come across Donald's house trailer. They amuse themselves by jumping on his car horn, which wakes up Donald, who chases them off. Donald heads for the swimming hole, but Chip and Dale mess with the diving board and send him crashing into his trailer. Next, they bomb Donald with pine-cones through the hole in his roof. Donald goes after them, but ends up wrecking his car.
