In Paris, Maxime visits his wealthy industrialist father Alexandre and his beautiful young Canadian wife, Renée. Alexandre fathered him years ago in a prior marriage and he has come to stay with them after studying in England. Renée tells Maxime that she married Alexandre when she was pregnant following an unhappy love affair; the child was stillborn and the passion between the two has faded. They begin an affair and fall in love with each other. Renée, who came from a wealthy family, asks Alexandre for a divorce. He agrees, on the condition that she leaves the fortune she brought to their marriage invested in his business. Renée accepts this and goes to Switzerland for a divorce. But while she is away, Alexandre confronts his son with two alternatives: he can either run off with now penniless Renée or become engaged to Anne, the daughter of a wealthy banker whose support Alexandre needs for his business. Maxime agrees on the second course of action. Renée returns from Switzerland to find Alexandre holding a ball celebrating Maxime's engagement to Anne. Renée throws herself into the pool to kill herself - but then changes her mind and dripping wet enters the party. Alexandre escorts her to the gymnasium, where she sits and stares into an empty future.
