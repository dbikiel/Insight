On October 29th, 1999, The Who gave an awesome and historic concert at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas...one night only! Legendary founding members ROGER DALTREY, PETE TOWNSHEND and JOHN ENTWISTLE, along with ZAK STARKEY and JOHN "RABBIT" BUNDRICK, drove the audience wild, knocking off 14 of their greatest rock classics in grand style. The concert was meant to be seen by an audience of over one billion - via the Internet. But due to "technical difficulties," the broadcast failed, leaving only those lucky enough to be sitting in the audience to witness this awesome performance. Set List: " I Can't Explain " Substitute " Anyway Anyhow Anywhere " Pinball Wizard " See Me, Feel Me " Baba O'Riley " My Wife " 5:15 " Behind Blue Eyes " Who Are You " Magic Bus " Won't Get Fooled Again " The Kids Are Alright " My Generation
