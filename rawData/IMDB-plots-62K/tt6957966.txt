A young couple must navigate a blossoming romance, amidst a war between their families' competing pizza restaurants.
Young adults Nikki Angioli and Leo Campo were staunch competitors and best friends growing up in the Little Italy neighborhood of Toronto. Their respective fathers, friends Sal Angioli and Vince Campo, ran Pizza Napoli, which made the best pizza in the neighborhood due to the combination of Nikki's paternal nona Franca Angioli's secret marinara sauce, and Leo's paternal nono Carlo Campo's secret thin crust pizza dough recipe. While Leo has stayed in Toronto working part-time at his father's pizzeria with the secret hopes of one day opening his own pizzeria, Nikki, who loved Leo while they were growing up, ran off to London five years ago hoping never to return to Toronto to get away from her past, which includes Leo himself, who she believes has turned into a ladies man solely trying to put notches in his bedpost, and Sal and Vince now in a feud of an unspecified nature following they winning best pizza in Little Italy several years ago, each subsequently having opened competing pizzerias next door to each other, which would preclude Nikki and Leo getting together even if either wanted. Nikki is working toward being a chef in her own right of anything but pizza, she at the cooking school of famed Michelin starred chef, Corinne, who seemingly has nothing nice to say about anyone, especially her students. Nikki learns that it is between her and another student, Gareth, who Corinne will choose to work at her new London restaurant, the two who will compete to produce the best menu. First, Nikki further learns that she has to deal with a visa issue, meaning that, whether or not she likes it, she has to return to Toronto for a few weeks. In inevitably running in Leo, she finds that there is still a sexual tension that exists between the two. They will have the many existing hurdles to overcome to get together, they each having to realize that they are hurdles worth overcoming, while learning some of those issues are truly non-existent.
