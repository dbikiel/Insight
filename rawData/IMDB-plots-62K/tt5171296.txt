Dr. Steve Brule directs himself in the title role of a rejected sitcom pilot about a Myer's Super Foods bagboy who must decide whether or not to report a shoplifter.
Socially awkward and mentally slow Steve Brule works as a bag boy and general clean-up guy at Myer's Super Foods. His main goal in life is to date and marry the pretty check-out girl, Daisy, although he believes that stock clerk Chip has the upper hand with her in that department, Chip who Steve hates because of it. When store owner, Pablo Myers, via his right hand flunky Scott Clam reports to all staff that there has been rash of shoplifting thefts and that he is offering a reward of ten free canned goods - and non-damaged ones at that - for anyone catching a shoplifter, Steve goes on a mission to catch a shoplifter as that would put him ahead of Chip for Daisy's heart as he would have ten more canned goods than Chip. Steve has to decide how far he will go to catch those shoplifters, especially as in doing so may ultimately put him behind in the race for Daisy's heart. Steve gets some advice from his trusted confidante, Dog and the guy with his hand up Dog's back.
