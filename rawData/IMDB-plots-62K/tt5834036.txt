Tim, a shy 16 years old athlete, is both brilliant and talented. But the pressure he undergoes pushes him to the edge, where human limits reach the point of no return.
Tim is a grade 11 student dealing with loss of his mother several years ago and his own sexuality at 16 going on 17. He was a star runner as a 12 year old with his mother as his coach. With his mother's death he gave up running and him and his friend are chemistry nerds who are bullied and harassed by the jocks at school. Tim eventually returns to running and expands his group of friends. HIs main competitor on the track, Jeff, continues his harassment and resorts to blackmail to hurt Tim's performance on the track with disastrous results.
