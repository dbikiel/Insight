Two friends from a small Greek town travel to Bulgaria and Switzerland, hoping they can gain money from the difference in foreign exchange rates.
In dire straits, two childhood friends who struggle to eke out a living somewhere in a sleepy village of Northern Greece--the unassuming bar owner, Stavros, and his impulsive partner, Fotis--summon up the nerve to change their lives once and for all. With their risky but seemingly infallible plan pivoting around the simple notion of exchanging American dollars to Bulgarian levs and then profiting from the difference between the currency exchange rates, the desperate and inexperienced opportunists set out on a mission across the late-1990s Balkans. Now, as East meets West aboard a rickety and completely unreliable Peugeot 404, the heist that promises to set Fotis and Stavros up for life begins; however, are they prepared to accept what awaits them at the end of this long road trip?
