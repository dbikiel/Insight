Donald Duck battles with those mischievous chipmunks Chip and Dale who are intent on raiding his nut butter shop.
Donald has a walnut-shaped shop where he makes nut butters. When his supply runs out, he taps the tree where Chip and Dale have been storing nuts. The chipmunks discover Donald's shop and think it's a giant walnut. When they finally break in, they start filching the finished product from Donald, and it takes him some time to notice.
