A policeman tries to protect a young woman against a hit man, when she flees New York after witnessing a mob killing.
Witness to a mob killing and afraid to testify, young Louise Graham flees to Montana where she hopes to disappear working in the gift shop at Glacier National Park. Staying at the park are vacationers Matt Hallett, ex-marine, and Paul Adams, amateur photographer, both obviously very interested in Louise and both vying for her attention. Louise is unaware that one is a mob hitman, hired to kill her to prevent her from testifying, and the other is a cop working for the New York D.A.'s office, sent to protect her.
Currently out on bail, Johnny Yonkers has been charged with the murder of a man named Battaglia. Johnny, who admits to the killing, states that it was in self defense. It was in reality a cold blooded mob hit. Johnny and his attorney know that there is an unknown female who witnessed him shoot Battaglia. The New York District Attorney's office also believes there is a witness. Both sides know that the case against Johnny is flimsy without that witness. As such, both sides dispatch undercover men to where they believe the witness has fled on her own volition: Glacier National Park in Montana. Johnny's men's task is to kill the witness, making it look like an accident. The DA's men's task is to bring the witness in and place her in protective custody so that she can testify at the trial. Complicating matters at Glacier National Park are: a native fugitive, Katoonai Tiller, also suspected of murder, his innocent and well respected daughter, Mary Tiller, who has to deal with the innuendo; the natural hazards of the park; and romance between some of the players which could cloud their judgment.
