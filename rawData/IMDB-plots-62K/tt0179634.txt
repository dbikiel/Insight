The frustration of an unkept promise and an insuppressible youthful rebellion lead to an unprecedented act of love, as the daughter of the Hellenic Naval Academy's commander and a fourth-year cadet meet again in the strangest of places.
Aliki is in love with someone who serves his duty in the greek navy. Wanting to see him, she disguises as a navy soldier and gets aboard her lover's ship. Things get more complicated when she comes accross the ship's captain; her father!
An amusing and succulently thrilling incident between two lively groups of enthusiastic excursionists in the sun-kissed island of Poros will prepare the ground for a brief but promising romantic interlude, as Aliki, the vibrant daughter of the Hellenic Naval Academy's commander, and Kostas, a fourth-year naval cadet, are clearly meant for each other. However, one thing leads to another, and the frustration of an unkept promise paired with an insuppressible youthful rebellion will give rise to an unprecedented act of love, as the well-armed Greek destroyer, Aetos, receives an uninvited and highly unlikely new sailor. But, is a sleek and powerful warship the ideal place to nurture a dangerous clandestine romance? Only a severe case of high-degree myopia may do the trick--either way--this is definitely a chance worth taking.
