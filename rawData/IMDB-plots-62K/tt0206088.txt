A girlie stranger to a small village seduces some men and causes real chaos in the lives of some straight citizens.
Meschede, Sauerland, Germany. In this little village, which is practically off any map, life goes at a slow pace. No issues of the wide world are much of a matter here. Until that one day, when Ina gets off the bus. She's a blonde, cute elf, just like one from a fairytale. After seducing several men from the village and blackmailing them all with her (fake) pregnancy, she's about to be shown how things are handled in Meschede. The victims of her play plan to kidnap her and beat her up a little, just to make sure. The plan goes terribly wrong and the former friends now face each other in mistrust. Also, Ina's attraction doesn't decrease at all.
