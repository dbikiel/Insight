After a massive power outage, two sisters learn to survive on their own in their isolated woodland home.
In a world that is increasingly dependent on electricity, a power outage seems like an awful predicament, as we can't imagine ourselves living in a world deprived of electricity. With this in mind, after a lingering power outage, a father and his two daughters will find themselves trapped in a completely different reality; one that will change their lives forever. But, is this outage regional, or does it affect the entire country? In the end--as these, and other, more crucial questions require an answer--no one can tell if the family has what it takes to survive; nonetheless, they will still have to put to the test their skills, their adaptability and endurance, but above all, find the courage to challenge the integrity of their familial bonds.
