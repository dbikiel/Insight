A boy finds a strange creature on a beach, and decides to find a home for it in a world where everyone believes there are far more important things to pay attention to.
In a not-so-distant future, somewhere in Australia's sandy beaches, a young boy while collecting bottle tops for his collection, makes an amazing discovery: a humongous and strange, yet friendly creature. Unable to classify this being, the boy soon realises that, in reality, the poor creature is actually lost and it has nowhere to go. But how could someone fail to notice such a magnificent living organism, moreover, how can a little boy find where it belongs?
