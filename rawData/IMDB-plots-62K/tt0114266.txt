Three stories of love and coincidence around the theme of dates in Paris.
Different stories of young women and men coming together and coming apart in Paris' romantic settings, are organized in four distinct chapters: (1) Le rendez-vous de 7 heures / The 7 p.m. rendezvous; (2) Le lendemain... / The next morning; (3) Les bancs de Paris / The seats of Paris' parcs; (4) MÃ¨re et Enfant, 1907 / Mother and Child, 1907.
Two street musicians alert us that a rendezvous can be surprising. In the first of the triptych, Esther learns her boyfriend may be cheating on her, so she arranges to meet a flirtatious stranger at a cafe. When she goes, surprises abound. In "The Benches of Paris," a couple meets in parks to stroll, kiss and talk. She already has a boyfriend, so while he's away, they plan to spend two days in a hotel, pretending to be tourists. Surprises alter their plans. In part three, a painter arranges to meet a Swedish tourist at a cafe. Then he sees a passing stranger, pursues her, and forgets the Swede. Alas, she's married, but advises him about his love life. Her advice gets mixed results.
