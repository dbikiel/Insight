An unethical lawyer, with an older brother he wants to help, becomes a partner with a client in the numbers racket.
Lawyer Joe Morse wants to consolidate all the small-time numbers racket operators into one big powerful operation. But his elder brother Leo is one of these small-time operators who wants to stay that way, preferring not to deal with the gangsters who dominate the big-time.
Joe Morse's a lawyer who crosses the line with his gangster client, Ben Tucker. Together, they've got a scheme to shut down all the illegal numbers banks in the city, and buy up the ones they want. Joe has an older brother, Leo, a man with heart trouble; and also runs an illegal numbers bank. Joe wants to do something good for Leo, to force his brother out of his penny-ante racket and come work for the big boys. Trouble is, Leo's happy with the way things are . His employees are like family to him. His secretary, Doris Lowry, is like a daughter. He wants nothing to do with his little brother's scheme and nothing to do with gangsters. But Joe won't give him a choice. Joe has a strong will - strong enough to make the sweet and innocent Doris fall in love with him. But he's still too weak to turn straight and save himself, and everyone connected to him, from disaster.
