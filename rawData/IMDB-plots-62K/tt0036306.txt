Beverly Ross moderates an 5:30 am radio show with swing music, dedicated to the local servicemen. Two buddies of her brother have a chance to meet her and both fall in love. One of them is a wealthy sponser, the other used to be his chauffeur, but before she can decide, which of them she likes more, the soldiers have their marching orders and are away to their destination.
Beverly Ross (Ann Miller), the switchboard operator at a local radio station, jumps at the chance to be the emcee of a recorded program at an early morning hour before the soldiers at a nearby army camp assemble for reveille. Beverly, sensing what bands and singers are favorites of the soldiers, plays recordings she knows they will like, and intersperses then with chatter and camp bulletins. Beverly's younger brother is a soldier at the camp, and two of his buddies, one rich and the other one poor, vie for Beverly's attentions.
