A clarinet player goes on a search for his real father, teaming up with an eccentric nightclub singer.
Hüseyin (Ata Demirer) is a young man who lives with his grandfather and grandmother in a village in Thracian Turkey.
The two great loves of his life are his clarinet and Müjgan, a nurse. Hüseyin is perfectly content with his music and his fantasies of Müjgan when an unexpected event causes him to leave the village. He ends up in Istanbul, where he is supported first by his clarinet and then by the singer Firuzan (Demet Akba).
A wildly popular nightclub performer who is eagerly working on an album, Firuzan leads a life that is as colorful as it is complicated. When Firuzan meets Hüseyin, the adventures and laughs begin.
