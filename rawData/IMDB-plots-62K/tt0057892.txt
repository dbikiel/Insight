In Greece, in the early part of the 20th century, two brothers from a wealthy landowning family have opposite views on how the poor workers who work on their land should be treated.
Under the scorching sun of June in turn-of-the-twentieth-century Thessaly, Odysseas Chormovas--the untamed and proud son of a powerful squire--returns to his birthplace to reunite with his father and older brother, Rigas, after a four-year-long imprisonment in Nafplio. Against the backdrop of a bitterly silent social turmoil, it is a common secret that, once more, an irrepressible rebellion followed by a violent confrontation for the equal sharing of the land boils over--a dangerously tense and volatile situation fanned by the preaching of a single man: the defiant intellectual, Marinos Andipas. But, this blessed soil is nourished by the sweat, the tears, and the innocent blood of the long-suffering field workers, men and women, and no power on this earth can suppress their voice. Can the furious blood spilled on the land appease the dead?
