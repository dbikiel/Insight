Nobody Walks in LA is the story of two old friends who, faced with decisions that cannot wait, put their lives on pause for a day and do the unthinkable.... walk around Los Angeles. Putting aside a failing engagement on the one hand and a cross country move on the other - Miles and Becca rediscover not just the streets of Los Angeles, but one another.
