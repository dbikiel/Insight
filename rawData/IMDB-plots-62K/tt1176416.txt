Losing his son Tom in a hit and run triggers violent emotions in Anthony, whose body begins to transform. When the driver who killed Tom reappears, Anthony mutates into a mass of metal - a human weapon fuelled by an uncontrollable rage.
Two long decades after the archetype flesh/metal mutation in Tetsuo (1989), and seventeen years after Taniguchi Tomoo's equally majestic transformation in Tetsuo II: Body Hammer (1992), another fine specimen--the American-Japanese white collar worker, Anthony--embraces the catalytic power of pain and rage, when a mysterious driver runs over and kills his only son, Tom. Unable to come to terms with his loss, the pained father allows a magnificent bio-mechanic transmutation elevate his malleable flesh to a higher form of existence, as cold metal protrusions and sophisticated weaponry enhance his body. Now, Machine-Anthony is invulnerable. Who can confront the all-powerful Bullet Man?
