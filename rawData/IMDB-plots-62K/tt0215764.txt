"The famous parade ground of Metropolitan fashion. Exquisitely gowned women, club men, actresses, millionaires pass by on their afternoon stroll." - from the Edison Catalog
Fifth Avenue in New York City is known for its 'parade of fashion', since many wealthy pedestrians in expensive clothes can usually be seen there. The camera first shows a stretch of sidewalk where a crowd has gathered, and then shows a different location where numerous persons are walking by, with some of them stopping to converse with one another.
