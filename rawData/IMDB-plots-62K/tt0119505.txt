A man buys a house on Manhattan, uninhabited for decades - except the ghosts of the previous owner and his wife. They meddle in his love life.
A bachelor afraid of marriage angers his long-time girlfriend by buying a splendid townhouse just for himself, only to find it haunted by the ghosts of a famous theatrical couple, who teach him about love and commitment.
Executive Stevenson Lowe (James Spader) moves to New York City to work in the publishing house that has belonged to his family for generations. He buys an old townhouse to live alone, disappointing his girlfriend Julia (Polly Walker) that believed they would move in together. Soon he discovers that the house is haunted by two amicable ghosts, the former theater stars from the 1920s, Max Gale (Sir Michael Caine) and Lily Marlowe (Dame Maggie Smith). Further, they are married and argue most of the time. Meanwhile, Senator Will Dodge (Sam Shepard) woos Julia, and she breaks up with Stevenson. His professional and private life turns upside-down, since the publishing house decides to accept to publish commercial and shallow books; his former lover Michelle Tippet (Marcia Gay Harden) hits on him; Julia travels to Washington, D.C. to meet the Senator; and the two ghosts quarrel all the time. But he learns how much he loves Julia. Will he succeed to have her back?
