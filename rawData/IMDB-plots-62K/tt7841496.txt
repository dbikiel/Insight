A policewoman, whose childhood friend disappeared in Patagonia years ago, starts a new search to find answers and soon finds her own life in danger.
It is based on the novel by Florencia Etcheves "Cornelia", in which a teacher from a prestigious school in Buenos Aires makes a study trip with five of her students, but only returns with four because one of them disappears mysteriously. It is Cornelia Villalba, who escapes with her companions to go dancing and gets lost in the middle of the Patagonian forests.
