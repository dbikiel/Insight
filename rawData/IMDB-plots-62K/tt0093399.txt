A tranquil forest and all of its residents must face the destruction of man. A squirrel, born and raised in the forrest, fights to defend his home and faces trials and adversities along the way. Designed as a tribute to the animation of Disney, the artwork and music evolve through a progression of styles from oldest to newest (at the time).
