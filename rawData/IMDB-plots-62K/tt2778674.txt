Badri (Vijay) is the youngest son of a family and a careless guy, always going around girls and enjoying with them. His womanizing habits are a source of heartburn for his father (Kitty). However, his elder brother, Vetri (Riyaz Khan), a kick-boxer and his father's favorite son, is very fond of him. Janu (Bhumika Chawla), Badri's neighbor, is in love with him, but it is just one sided as Badri considers her a good friend and a source of money and cars to impress girls (Janu's father is a garage owner). He falls in love with Mamathi (Monal), a rich girl, and poses as a rich guy to impress her. However, she soon finds out Badri has lied to her. Mamathi dumps Badri and insults him in front of his father. Badri's father, tired of his son's antics, disowns him. Later Vetri is attacked by his enemies and is bedridden, unable to take part in the kick boxing championship. Badri decides to fight in his brother's place to redeem his family name as his father always wanted his son to win the kick boxing championship. So he trains hard and fights against Rohit, who happens to be Mamathi's new boyfriend. He defeats Rohit, redeems himself in front of his father's eyes and finally accepts Janu's love.
