When a devastating illness threatens to end Evan Lake's career in the C.I.A., he goes rogue to hunt down a terrorist who tortured him during a mission gone awry years ago.
Veteran CIA agent Evan Lake has been ordered to retire. But when his protégé uncovers evidence that Lake's nemesis, the terrorist Banir, has resurfaced, Lake goes rogue, embarking on a perilous, intercontinental mission to eliminate his sworn enemy.
Rescued in the nick of time, the seasoned CIA field agent, Evan Lake, escapes certain death by the hand of his sadistic torturer and Islamic terrorist, Muhammad Banir. Now, twenty-two long and hard years later, disquieting rumours paired with sparse evidence that Banir is still alive, send a grizzled and ailing Lake along with his young protégé, Milton, to Bucharest, on a dangerous quest for retribution. More than anything, the battle-scarred operative needs closure. However, will Banir's death quiet down the noisy echoes of the past?
