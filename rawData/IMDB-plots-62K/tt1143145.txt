When the driver manages to crash the car on the road in the middle of nowhere the four-man-passenger-team (well, 1 girl and 3 guys, actually) have no other choice than to walk through the dark woods to the nearest hostel. Combine this scenario with zombies, a hockey-mask wearing giant and an annoying doll who demands popcorn, and you'll have "H3: Halloween Horror Hostel".
