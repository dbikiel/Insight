Tarzan acts as a guide for two British government agents recently arrived in Africa to secure a great cache of diamonds for the English military. However, the agents are not what they seem.
Tarzan's cousin comes to Africa in hopes that Tarzan will help him secure a fortune in diamonds essential to England's military security. The cousin is immediately killed off by his guide Rokov who persuades Edwards to impersonate the cousin. Joey (Boy's substitute) was used by natives as crocodile bate until Tarzan rescued him.
When two men arrive at Tarzan and Jane's jungle home, one of them claims to be Tarzan's cousin, Greystoke. He and his traveling companion Roskov have the diary belonging to Tarzan's father and it tells of a great cache of diamonds belonging to a remote tribe. They convince Jane that they need to get control of those diamonds for industrial use and for the future of England. They travel over mountains and across an arid desert and have to battle the natives who control the diamonds. Unbeknown to them however is the fact that the man claiming to be Tarzan's cousin is an impostor and he and Roskov want the diamonds for their own personal gain.
