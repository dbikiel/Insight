A lawyer's fianc√©e leaves him after he defends a racketeer accused of murder, but she needs his help when her new beau is accused of killing an old flame.
Racketeer Tony Gazotti is thankful that lawyer Jackson Durant helps him beat a murder rap, but Durant just does it for the thrill of it and refuses payment. Durant's defense of mobsters causes his firm to disown him and his girlfriend Sue to leave him. But when young Tom Siddall, Sue's new boyfriend, is framed for a murder, she is the first to come asking for Durant's help. Durant uses Gazotti's information network and the help of new girlfriend Gertie Waxted to find that rival gangster Jim Crelliman is involved in the framing of Siddall. When Durant sends Gertie to Crelliman's apartment in a bid to blow open the case, she is walking on thin ice.
