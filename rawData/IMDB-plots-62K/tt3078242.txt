An unnerving story about a horrid family drama kept behind closed doors, and an elaborate facade where appearances can be deceiving, and nothing is as it seems.
To celebrate Aggeliki's eleventh birthday, a well-organised party is held in her honour. Everything is in order, and all the ingredients of a usual birthday gathering are here: a nice and big sugar-glazed cake, happy music, a caring grandfather's embrace--a truly loving family environment. However, is any of this real, or is this an elaborate facade? Little by little, as a devastating act of despair unfolds before a stunned family, wolves and lambs slowly get lured into a web of hideous secrets, and a frantic downward spiral of lies and deceptive appearances. But, in the end, as one unwillingly unravels the sinners' blood-curdling mysteries kept behind closed doors, the plunge into the depths of the human soul and the unfathomable secrets within is inevitable.
