Spoof of romantic comedies which focuses on a man, his crush, his parents, and her father.
Julia Jones is unhappy. She's overweight, spends forever working at her fathers diner, and believes she will always be lonely. This is until she meets Grant Fockyerdoder. Before they can have their dream wedding, they must meet each others parents and survive the scheming Andy.
Julia Jones has found the perfect guy, the very-British and very-unfortunately-named Grant Fockyerdoder. But before they can have their Big Fat Greek Wedding, they must Meet the Parents, hook up with The Wedding Planner, and contend with Grant's friend Andy who wants to put an end to her Best Friend's Wedding.
Julia Jones is a lonely, overweight 30-something woman of Greek, Indian, Japanese, and Jewish decent. After looking for love in several wrong places, and receiving as many rejections, she gets pimped out and is thus better equipped to find and court the man of her dreams, Grant Fockyerdoder. Before she can do so, however, she must overcome a dozen or so obstacles that shamelessly spoof several popular romantic comedies, such as My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Meet the Parents, The Bachelor, My Best Friend's Wedding, Kill Bill, Pretty Woman, Napoleon Dynamite, When Harry Met Sally, Wedding Crashers, Say Anything, Hitch, Sleepless in Seattle, The Wedding Planner, King Kong, and a few others. Will she get her man in the end? If you don't know the answer, you need to see a few more Date Movies.
