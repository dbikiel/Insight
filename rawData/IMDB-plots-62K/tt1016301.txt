4 mathematicians are invited to solve an enigma. Once there, they're locked in a mechanically shrinking room and given 1 minute to solve each puzzle via cellphone while also figuring out why they're there.
Four mathematicians who do not know each other are invited by a mysterious host on the pretext of resolving a great enigma. The room in which they find themselves turns out to be a shrinking room that will crush them if they do not discover in time what connects them all and why someone might wish to murder them.
After resolving a test with a sequence of numbers, four mathematicians are challenged by a mysterious man called Fermat to meet in an isolated place to resolve the greatest enigma ever. Each one receives a code name - Hilbert, Pascal, Galois and Oliva - and heads to a barn on an island. Inside the barn, they find a comfortable room, and soon their host arrives. They have dinner together and Fermat receives a phone call from the hospital, where his daughter in interned in coma. He asks to leave the place for one hour; however after his departure, the quartet finds that they are locked in the room. They receive a phone call with a mathematical riddle and given one minute to reply; soon they find that if they do not find the answer to the questions, the walls move and the room shrinks, pressed in by four Poseidon hydraulic presses. While responding the questions, they try to find Fermat's motive - why they have been gathered together to be killed.
