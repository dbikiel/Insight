Mother-in-law has been presented with a new set of false teeth, the gift of her son-in-law. The teeth are much admired by the family, but unfortunately their acquisition enables mother-in-law to chatter even more volubly than before. She gets into a quarrel with a neighbor on the street. In the argument she drops her teeth and loses them. A man passing by finds them. While examining them closely the "jaws" close with a snap on his nose. Another person coming along helps him to get rid of the biting teeth and places them on a bench. A gentleman of leisure coming along takes a seat on the bench, but instead of getting the rest and comfort he anticipated, he finds himself in the same predicament as if he had sat on a sharp jawed rat-trap. His screams of anguish bring two policemen to the rescue, who gingerly remove the dental apparatus. They take it to the police station, but when they get there, in explaining to the chief how the teeth work, they themselves are cruelly bitten. At last the chief of police, with the assistance of a pair of tongs from the stove, succeeds in securing the teeth and throws them out of the window beyond the possibility of creating further trouble.
