A drama revolving around a group of strangers brought together by a common occurrence as well as listening to the same radio station.
A serial killer is on the prowl in the badlands of Ozona, Oklahoma, and the travelers who intersect at a roadside cafeteria somewhere between Texas and New Mexico are destined to cross his path. They include a circus clown and his stripper girlfriend, grieving sisters, a trucker, and a woman who is taking her mother to see the ocean before she dies. Tying everything together even tighter is the presence of the local radio station, whose DJ and boss don't seem to be getting along too well.
A serial killer is stalking the roads between New Mexico and Texas and the passengers that we meet are destined to become his victims. We meet our parties at a cafeteria where a trucker stops for coffee. In the restaurant are a woman who has run out of gas and is trying to get her grandmother to the coast one last time before she dies, a fired and broke circus clown trying to get to Vegas with his stripper girl friend, and sisters who are going to their father's funeral. The killer is easy to spot. While all of the mayhem is ongoing, all motorists are tuned into a local DJ who is feuding with his station manager.
