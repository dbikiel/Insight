Seasoned grifter Dolly Crandall returns to the 'badger game' but has a change of heart when she falls in love with a young man she believes is a rich Southerner.
Dolly, alias "Angel Face," meets a naive young man at a hotel who appears to be rich. Thinking she's found an easy mark, she marries him, only to find out that the plantation he was bragging about belongs to a neighbor, and his fortune is more speculative than real. In spite of herself, she falls in love with him.
