Winter came, and everything around was covered with snow: such a grace for games, pranks and sports, and the Bear is sleeping. The Pup, the Bunny and the Squirrel decided to wake up their friend from hibernation. Finally, with great difficulty they did succeed, and the Bear gets out to the rink. Despite the fact that his grandfather does not like his winter games, the little Bear still ventured to skate and quickly became involved in the life of the forest sports school. And when came the day for the demonstration of performances of young figure skaters, the grandfather still got up.
