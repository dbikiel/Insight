Without ambition, unmotivated, and broke, the twenty-something slacker, Niko Fischer, suddenly, finds his carefully disordered life crumbling into pieces. Before he even starts his day, Niko breaks up with his girlfriend; is deemed unfit to drive by a sarcastic psychiatrist--and if that isn't enough--his father cuts his allowance after unearthing an embarrassing secret. Under those circumstances, having a large cup of fresh coffee is of vital importance; however, even this simple task proves filled with disappointment. Where will Niko's endless wandering in the bustling streets of Berlin lead?
