True story of a daring Israeli commando assault on the Entebbe Airport in Uganda to free hostages of a terrorist hijacking.
Based on a true military operation by Israeli commandos. An Air France flight is hijacked by the P.F.L.P. The plane has about one hundred Jewish passengers. The plane is grounded in Uganda. Israelis would not negotiate. This movie then shows how less than five hundred soldiers actually flew so far and rescued the passengers in one of the most successful military operations in history. The only casualty for Israeli soldiers was Lieutenant Colonel Yonatan "Yonni" Netanyahu.
