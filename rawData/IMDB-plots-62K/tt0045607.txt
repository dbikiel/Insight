The Captain of a ferry boat between the restricted British colony in Gibraltar and Spanish Morocco has a woman of differing appeal and temperament in each port.
Mediterranean ferryboat Captain Henry St. James has things well organized, a loving and very English wife Maud in Gibraltar, and the loving, if rather more hot-blooded Mistress, Nita in Tangiers. A perfect life. As long as neither woman decides to follow him to the other port.
Henry St. James, Captain of a large ferry that shuttles between the British colony in Gibraltar and the Spanish-ruled peninsula of Ceuta in northern Morocco, is a man who covertly maintains a wife at one port, and a mistress at another. For security reasons, access to Gibraltar is restricted and the only member of the Golden Fleece's crew eligible for shore leave is St. James, so the likelihood of St. James' women meeting is remote despite their relatively close proximity. Each woman represents a different aspect of womanhood that the Captain finds attractive. Maud in Gibraltar is a dutiful wife and housekeeper, a good cook, and a faithful homebody, while Nita in Morocco is a voluptuously sexy siren who appeals to his more hedonistic nature, which loves dancing and drinking until dawn. Trouble in Paradise begins when Maud begins to crave a more carefree existence, and Nita longs to develop her domestic skills.
