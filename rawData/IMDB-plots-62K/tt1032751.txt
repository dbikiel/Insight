A warrior-assassin is forced to hide in a small town in the American Badlands after refusing a mission.
Yang, the world's finest swordsman, packs it in and leaves Japan to find an old friend in the Wild West rather than kill the infant queen of a rival clan. He carries the baby to his friend's desolate, broken-down town; the friend has died, so Yang reopens a laundry and settles down, hanging wet clothes, growing flowers, raising the infant, and finding himself attracted to Lynne, a red-haired woman with a tragic past. As long as Yang keeps his sword sheathed, his rivals won't find him, but a band of reprobate gunmen terrorize the town and threaten Lynne. Showdowns are inevitable, but once the sword is drawn, can Yang find rest, a home, and a family?
Master Yang's latest sword duel victory allows him to achieve his family's goal, exterminating the rival samurai gang, but he spares an enemy infant 'heiress'. Knowing this exposes him to bloody revenge from his own clan, led by his mentor, who mobilizes for that purpose, Yang flees Asia to a friend in the Wild West. Arrived in the petty Badlands town, he finds his mate deceased, laving no heir but him for his meager income, the only launderette., among a freak population of stranded circus people. Yang decides to stay in that hideout, growing flowers and forming a laundry partnership with shameless red-hair Lynne, who helps raise the baby and is sort of trained for battle. He takes charge, despite considering to leave quietly rather then risk attracting his nemesis's attention, when the region's black band of reprobate gunmen returns, threatening to kill and plunder massively once more.
