A female FBI agent comes to a distrustful Amish community to investigate a multiple building arson incident.
In a small Amish community, three barns are burnt down almost simultaneously. FBI agent Sally Russwell is sent in to investigate this possible hate crime. What she finds however is a community that little trust for outsiders or "The English" as they call them. However, in her investigations, Agent Russell makes friends with one entrepreneurial widow, Annie Beiler who has her own curiosity about this stranger. Together, Annie introduces Russell in-depth to this close knit community bearing many appealing attributes. However, as Sally's investigations continue, she discovers secrets that reveal uncomfortable truths about the religious community that are linked to the arson attacks.
When an arsonist brings violence and destruction to a peaceful Amish sect, FBI agent Sally Russell is sent to investigate. She is immediately branded as one of "The English" - the Amish term for "outsider," and they will not trust her. Amish widow Annie Beiler, however, is curious about the women of the outside world, and is willing to let Sally earn her trust. If these women from different worlds can work together, they may be able to bring the criminal to justice, and form a friendship in the process. Originally broadcast as part of the Hallmark Hall of Fame.
