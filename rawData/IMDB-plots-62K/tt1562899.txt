In the Beginning, Three were Created...Man made of Clay.Angels made of Light.And a Third...made of Fire.From the beginning, stories of angels and men have captured our imaginations and have been etched into our history crossing all boundaries of culture, religion, and time. These two races have dominated the landscape of modern mythology for countless centuries, almost washing away the evidence that a third ever existed. This third race, born of smokeless fire, was called the jinn. Similar to humans in many ways, the jinn lived invisibly among us and only under dire or unusual circumstances were our paths ever meant to cross.As humans became the dominant force on Earth, contact between man and jinn steadily decreased.Modern man has all but forgotten the jinn.
