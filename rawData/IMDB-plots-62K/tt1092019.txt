A man convicted of killing his own father and sister escapes from a criminal hospital to track down his mother and prove his innocence.
Johan, convicted for the murder of his father and sister, has been locked up in a TBS clinic (a hospital for criminals with a psychical disorder) for years. When he hears he will be transfered to a Long Stay ward - where nobody has ever been released from - he hopes his mother, who he hasn't spoken for years, will come to his hearing so she can tell the judge he didn't murder his sister, that his father abused him and was about to abuse his sister and that Johan therefore killed his father. However, his mother doesn't turn up. Realizing he's out of options, he escapes, determined to find his mother, so she can write a statement saying what really happened. Pretty soon however, he gets pursued by the police and in a rather desperate attempt to stay out of their hands, he kidnaps a 13-year old girl, Tessa. Together they drive through the Netherlands and Belgium to find his mother.
