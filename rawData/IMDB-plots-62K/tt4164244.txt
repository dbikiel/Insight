Mary's mistake was to ignore a group of performance artists (The Crows) in the street. Tormented and alone in her home, Mary quickly learns that The Crows' art is crafted in blood and terror.
Bad things happen to bad people. That's what Ursula, the ring leader of a deranged group of street performers called "The Crows", always says. For no apparent reason, the gang starts to torment Mary and Judy: a young car driver and her dog. Her only crime was not paying attention to the annoying street performers. For Mary, the curtains of the most insane and dangerous show will rise - and fall. The Crows' show is not just about blood. We proudly assure you it will be the scariest, most uncomfortable and grotesque performance you will ever see.
Unfortunately for young Mary, she was in the wrong place at the wrong time. When, unwisely, she treated with contempt Ursula--the intimidating leader of a wandering team of clown-themed street performers known as the Crows--her life took a turn for the worse. Now, as Mary faces strange incidences in her house, she has become a helpless prisoner within her home's overestimated safety, tormented by invisible assailants and pitiless intruders who want to destroy her. Under those circumstances, a petrified woman home alone, a ravenous pack of deranged blood-thirsty clowns, and an enigmatic spike crate drenched in blood can only mean one thing: shortly, Mary is about to have her very own private show to the bloody end.
