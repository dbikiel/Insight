"The Spike Jones Story" is the first documentary made about this innovative, musical humorist. Now, Jones is best remembered as the creator of surreal musical numbers which topped the charts in America for over a decade. These classics are popular because of their inspired and complex lunacy. Jones was an inspiration to dozens like him, such as Monty Python's Flying Circus and Ernie Kovacs.
