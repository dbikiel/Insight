A criminal starts questioning his violent way of life when he searches for the unknown assailant who almost shot him to death.
A criminal from Amsterdam barely surviving a liquidation.
An old Frisian farmer bent on revenge.
An illegal immigrant with uncertain prospects.
Eventually, they meet under an ancient oak tree.
Beyond the last town.
