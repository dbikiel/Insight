A city cop is sent out to the country to go undercover and bust up a ring of moonshiners run by a woman and her three hot teenage daughters.
In Barefoot County, hot mama Mary Ann Hogan runs successfully the family's burgeoning moonshine business much to Sheriff Bull Tatum's annoyance who has been trying for months to shut it down. Under those circumstances and without further delay, the police headquarters decide to send the handsome officer Jeff Wilson as an undercover agent down to Barefoot County to make an investigation. But before long, Jeff will meet mama Stella Holcomb's curvaceous and sensational daughters who don't plan to surrender easily.
