At the suggestion of a straight friend, gay man Leo joins a men's group, where he causes some upsets by declaring his attraction to one of its members.
Keith runs a male bonding group, which was meant to be macho fun, but acts as therapist as dreaded-unmanly emotional and even relational problems prove unavoidable.

Things risk ending ugly as it turns out Brendan's girlfriend is Leo's school ex and still able to seduce him.
A man enters therapy after many failed relationships and is disconsolate about having any social life. In the group session, he comes clean about his feelings for another group member which leads to a homosexual affair. Then the situation is complicated by the re-union with his original high school sweetheart and the whole thing transcends into sexual ambiguity.
