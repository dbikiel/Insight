When El Mono dies, his three longtime friends try to recover from the loss and want to secure his little girl's future. But for Fernando, Mauricio and El Ruso this will not be easy. They decide to recover a big investment El Mono had made when he had bought a soccer player who was supposed to become a star.
When Alejandro "Mono" dies, his brother and two closest friends, a tight-knit group since childhood, are left to figure out how to take care of his young daughter, Guadalupe. They want to give her all the love they felt for Mono and secure her future, but there isn't a single peso left in the bank. Mono invested all of his money in a promising soccer player whose promise hasn't panned out, and the three hundred thousand dollars Mono spent on his transfer is soon to be lost for good. How do you sell a forward who can't score a goal? How do you maintain relationships when repeated failures create fissures in lifelong loyalties? Fernando, Mauricio, and "Ruso" pool the few resources in their arsenal to come up with strategies in their desperate attempt to recoup Mono's investment for Guadalupe. Papers in the Wind is a tribute to friendship and proof that love and humor can triumph over sadness.
