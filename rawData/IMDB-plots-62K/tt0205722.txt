In the year 2011, the prison system is run by the private sector. Business tycoon R.D. Crowley (Robert Davi) has created a Virtual Reality prison. The prisoner's bodies are locked in suspended animation while their mind traverses the lethal labyrinth of games Crowley has designed for them. Crowley allows wealthy sportsmen to participate, for a price, in deadly VR combat with the prisoners.
