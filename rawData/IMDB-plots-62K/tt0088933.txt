When a group of trespassing seniors swim in a pool containing alien cocoons, they find themselves energized with youthful vigor.
A group of aliens return to earth to retrieve cocoons containing the people they'd left behind from an earlier trip. These cocoons had been resting at the bottom of the ocean. Once retrieved, they stored these recovered cocoons in the swimming pool of a house they'd rented in a small Florida town. Their mission is hampered by a number of elderly people from a nearby retirement community who had been secretly using the pool, and who discover unusual powers from within these cocoons.
Oscar-winning fantasy in which the residents of a Florida rest home get a new lease of life when they stumble across an alien "fountain of youth" in a disused holiday home. Unbeknown to them, aliens have been using the swimming pool in the house to store their cocooned brethren, giving the waters a powerful, rejuvenating quality.
Meet Art, Ben and Joe. Three simple, aging senior citizens who like to swim in an unguarded swimming pool next door from the old folks home they live in. So one day while they are swimming, they feel energized and "ready to take on the world!" What they don't know is that the pool was recently rented by four alien Antareans living incognito as humans. Art, Ben, Joe and their friends soon discover this and offer to help the Antareans return the cocoons back to Antarea; and as a reward, they are offered something unusually magnificent.
