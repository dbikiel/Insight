A resident of a suburban dystopia tries to reassemble his fragmented memories of life as a teen.
Directed by Spike Jonze, Scenes from the Suburbs is a half-hour short film inspired by Arcade Fire's Grammy(r) award-winning album The Suburbs. Hailed as "absolutely f--king gorgeous" by INDIEWIRE at its U.S. premiere at 2011's SXSW festival, this collaborative effort between Spike and the band is a part of Arcade Fire's The Suburbs Deluxe release.
