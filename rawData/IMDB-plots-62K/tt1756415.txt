Now back in Milan, Alberto has accepted to manage a program for efficiency improvement in the Italian Post. He devotes all his time and energy to this noble task and neglects his wife Silvia, which of course annoys her beyond limits. Things don't go much better in Castellabate where it is rather Maria, Matta's wife, who gets on his nerves by always blaming him for his lack of ambition. One day, due to a misunderstanding, Mattia is transferred to... Milan. And on whose doorstep does he land? Alberto's, of course!
