A small town is terrorized by "The Banana Killer", which turns out to be the missing link between man and ape.
A monkey-type monster falls in love with a blind girl, which thinks that he's a giant dog. After kidnapping the girl and fleeing king-kong-like onto the roof of a gym, he gets involved with the army.
Schlock is a fun twist on an old tale. Schlock - and ape man frozen/preserved is accidentally released and goes on a rampage. Mayhem follows with typical over the top slash and gore in the same vein as "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes". Played fully with tongue in cheek - like a television competition to "Guess how many people these body part will make". John Landis plays the part of Schlock and although expressing emotions through a monkey suit is not easy - he gets the point across.
