Maddened by grief over his late queen, king Tobald decides to wed their only daughter Lotte, the only female resembling her. Having failed to put him off by exorbitant demands, she puts on the unique cloak made of all fur types in the realm and flees over the border, carrying only her mother's three-party golden seduction kit and the king's miniaturized gifts while posing as a poor girl. Hunting, king Jacob finds her and orders her into court chef Mathis's scullery. He appreciates her zeal and culinary talents, helping him put the best dishes ever before the king, who is determined to find out about the gastronomic phenomenon, yet she makes that difficult.
