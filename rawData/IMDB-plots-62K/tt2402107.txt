Trapped behind the Boundary Fence, Freya dreams of escape and pursues a dangerous outsider who can free her.
A dysfunctional family in a dystopian, no, appocalyptic, world between a Poisoned sea and a fence patrolled by 'riders' on horseback. A 'rider' with a history and a conscience. A woman with questions. What has happened to get here? To say much more is a travesty. If you want something different, this is it. To my wife, this my 2001 moment but instead of being pissed off, I am - Thrilled.
