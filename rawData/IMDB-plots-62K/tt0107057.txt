A female lawyer takes an accused wife-murderer as a client, but finds herself morally compelled to betray him one way or another.
A man accused of murdering his wife approaches a hotshot female criminal attorney to take his case. The man is a self-professed womaniser, and his alleged motive would be the large sum of money his wife left him. The attorney begins to have second thoughts about representing him when he starts making it look like they're having an affair and tells her things she can't reveal because of lawyer/client privilege, so she starts her own investigation of him, which threatens her career and the safety of her friends and herself.
In Chicago, after winning another important case, the prominent lawyer Jennifer "Jenny" Haines is approached by the cynical David Edgar Greenhill, who is accused of murdering his wife. Greenhill is an arrogant self-confident womanizer that explores wealthy women and Jenny declines the case. However she finds Greenhill an intriguing blunt man and she decides to accept the challenge of defending him in court seeking the promotion of the trial by the press and the chance to prove how good she is again. But soon she regrets since her friend and veteran investigator Moe Plimpton finds that Greenhill has a suspicious past with other wealthy women that died and her boyfriend Phil Garson has problems with him. But the manipulative Greenhill creates a situation and Judge D. Tompkins forces Jenny and her firm to defend Greenhill. Soon Greenhill confidentially discloses other murders to Jenny using the lawyer-client privilege. Trapped to a criminal, what will Jenny do?
