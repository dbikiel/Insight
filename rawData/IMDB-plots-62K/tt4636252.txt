Marja is a blogger. Olavi is one of the richest men in the country. She might be able to save her blog if she dates him, but what if she falls for him for real?
Fashion and lifestyle blogger Marja gives Olavi a fake name and number after rear-ending him, but when she takes a job with her sister's catering company to make ends meet, and by coincidence works an event that Olavi attends, she learns he owns a share in his affluent family's successful paper company. A relationship with one of the country's wealthiest men might just be what her blog needs to get sponsorship, but she finds herself conflicted when she starts to fall for him for real.
