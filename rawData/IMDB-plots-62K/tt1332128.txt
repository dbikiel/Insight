Zeitgeist: Addendum attempts to locate the root causes of the pervasive social corruption, while also offering a solution.
Zeitgeist: Addendum attempts to locate the root causes of the pervasive social corruption, while also offering a solution. This solution is not based on politics, morality, laws, or any other "establishment" notions of human affairs, but rather on a modern, non-superstitious based understanding of what we are and how we align with nature, to which we are a part of. The work advocates a new social system which is updated to present day knowledge, highly influenced by the life long work of Jacque Fresco and The Venus Project.
