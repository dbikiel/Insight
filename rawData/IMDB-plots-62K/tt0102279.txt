Two young men evading the police for a crime they didn't commit are cryogenically frozen in the early 1960s. The next thing they know is that they are in a strange new world (thirty years on).
Two young men, one in need of medical attention, are cryogenically frozen in the early 1960s. The two are preoccupied with the fact that the police are pursuing them to realise what they are doing. The next thing they know is that they are in a strange new world (thirty years on).
In the early 60s, two best friends and brothers-in-law, Willie, who's being pursuit by the police after a shooting because they don't know it was in self-defense, and Frank, whose kidneys are failing, agree to take part in an experiment where they would be cryogenically frozen for a while. Unfortunately, things don't go as planned and they are left frozen and forgotten. Eventually they awake by accident in 1991. Now they must come to terms with their predicament and find and reconnect with the people they love.
