In an utopian, futuristic world, where humanity has acquired eternal life, a young high ranked agent of the world's leading health company investigates a wave of suicides.
In an idyllic future, a group of terrorists trigger a mass suicide that shocks the globe. Government agent Tuan Kirie, can't help but think their message sounds familiar-almost identical to the ideals held by a friend who'd supposedly killed herself years earlier. Will chasing a ghost from her past be the key to unlocking a brighter future?
Mankind has finally achieved Utopia due advancements in medical nanotechnology and a powerful ethic of social welfare and mutual consideration. However, this world isn't as perfect as it appears. 3 girls attempt to stand against the totalitarian kindness and super-medicine, and attempt to commit suicide by starvation. They fail, but one of them grows up to become a World Health Organization member. When a crisis threatens the Utopian harmony, she gets back in touch with one of the other girls, so they can save the planet...from itself.
