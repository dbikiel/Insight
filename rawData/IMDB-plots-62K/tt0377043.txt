When Zoe Tripp a striking beautiful folk singer, joins Olive's cause, Gavin gets thrown for a loop, falling hard for the striking young woman with the golden voice. Caught between Olive's righteousness and Gavin's affection, the idealistic and innocent Zoe, coached by her parents and a maternal environmentalist must choose between a cause she's grown up supporting, or the affections of a man who stands for everything she believes is wrong.
