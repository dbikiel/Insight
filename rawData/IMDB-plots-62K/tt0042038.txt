Dr. I.C. Spots is an African witch doctor about to prepare a potion which needs as one of its ingredient a rabbit.
An African witch doctor is cooking up a potion in his big black pot. He has the lizard tongue, fish eyes, gnats' eyebrows, jigger of xxx, bee-stingers, leopard spots and frogs' legs. But he throws a screaming tantrum when he discovers that he's out of rabbit. Meanwhile, Bugs Bunny decides to go to Kuka Munga (one mile) instead of Hubba Hubba (also one mile). He made a bad choice. He meets the witch doctor, who captures him and throws him into his pot. Bugs at first thinks the doc is offering him a hot bath. But when he smells himself cooking, he realizes the horrible truth. Bugs will have to disguise himself as a native female and battle an alligator before his latest adventure is over.
