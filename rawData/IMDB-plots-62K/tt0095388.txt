A Scotland Yard police inspector, battling the booze, investigates the Jack the Ripper murders and discovers a conspiracy that leads all the way up to the Queen.
During the latter half of 1888, a notorious serial killer nicknamed Jack the Ripper terrorises the East End of London by murdering prostitutes in a terribly violent way. Public outrage follows. Chief Inspector Frederick Abberline is assigned to the case, but finds that it is not just a simple murder enquiry. Based on a real-life event, this movie claims to have had access to top secret Home Office files and believe that their ending is the correct solution to the age old mystery.
