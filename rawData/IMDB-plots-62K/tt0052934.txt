A U.S. sergeant serving in Spain creates envy among his Air Force superiors and the Spanish locals when his brand new futuristic sports car and pretty wife arrive at the base.
Air Force Sgt. Joe Fitzpatrick meets and marries a beautiful model, Maggie Putnam, on the eve of being shipped off to Spain. When the new Mrs. Fitzpatrick waits to join her husband, she promises him in a letter "the most wonderful surprise that could happen to two people." Joe naturally assumes that she's pregnant, but the surprise turns out to be a fabulous new car that he won in a raffle. His new bride and car win him the scorn and jealousy of Spain's most famous toreador, not to mention the suspicions of his commanding officer.
