An experimental short film that variously features singing and storytelling, touching upon topics such as nations, death, religion, sex, and evil.
A man fondles objects, looks at himself in the mirror, poses in different clothes, smiles and makes faces at the camera while his voice on the soundtrack speaks of his despair, makes impressionistic statements and little songs, quotes Greta Garbo and Maria Montez, tells the story of a lonely little boy and (in drag) tells the story of a woman (Madame Nescience) who dreams of herself as the mother superior of a convent of sexual perversion.
From the school of pretentious nonsense, this short film is made up of a pastiche of scenes without any sense or sequence. Bad musical numbers and improvised dialogue that is for the most part nonsensical. The point of the film is unknown and cannot be explained.
