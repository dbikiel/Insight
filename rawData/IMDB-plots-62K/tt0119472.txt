Two terminally ill patients escape from a hospital, steal a car and rush towards the sea.
Two young men, Martin and Rudi, both suffering from terminal cancer, get to know each other in a hospital room. They drown their desperation in Tequila and decide to take one last trip to the sea. Drunk and still in pajamas they steal the first fancy car they find, a 60's Mercedes convertible. The car happens to belong to a bunch of gangsters, which immediately start to chase it, since it contains more than the pistol Martin finds in the glove box.
Two unlike, 30s, German men at the hospital's "death row" get drunk. They steal a mob car with a gun and DEM1,000,000 in it and use them on their road trip to see the sea before dying. The Mob wants its car and money back and chase them as do the police.
