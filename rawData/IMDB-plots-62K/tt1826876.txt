Alberto, a divorced father, takes his two children for a vacation at a thermal resort in Salto. Things don't turn out as planned as the non-stop rain forces them to stay indoors, away from the pools and with no TV. Alberto's efforts to entertain his children are met with indifference by Federico, his youngest son, and Luc√≠a, his teenage daughter.
