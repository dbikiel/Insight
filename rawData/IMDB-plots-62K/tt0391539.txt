Several of Korea's most acclaimed filmmakers, including Park Chan-wook (OLDBOY), explore the nature of discrimination in this provocative anthology.
Its an obvious truism that portmanteau features are always mixed bags, but this anthology of shorts by six leading Korean directors is more coherent than most largely because it was made for the National Human Rights Commission, and so all but one of its episodes deals with a human rights issue. (The exception is Park Kwang-Sus neat little car-park ghost story, made before the project picked up its focus.) Park Chan-Wook (of Sympathy for Mr Vengeance) tackles racial prejudice and the economic exploitation of immigrant workers through the real-life story of a Nepalese woman in Korea. Jeong Jae-Eun (of Take Care of My Cat) tackles the plight of a paedophile released into the community. Yeo Gyun-Dong invites disabled actor Kim Moon-Joo to re-enact his most famous protest. And, in the two best episodes, Im Soon-Rye (of Waikiki Brothers) goes for the engrained sexism of Korean men with superb wit and Park Jin-Pyo (of Too Young to Die) confronts the horror of children forced into oral surgery to improve their English-speaking ability
