A rich rocket scientist organizes an expedition to the moon, which they discover is inhabited by nude women.
Dr. Huntley and Professor Nichols are able to complete their work on a moon rocket because of an unexpected inheritance. They travel to the moon, but find a lush garden paradise rather than a barren wasteland. They are captured by virtually naked telepathic humanoids and taken in front of the Great Council. The Moon Goddess decides they should be allowed to continue their experiments, and Dr. Huntley begins falling in love with her. Professor Nichols worries about getting Huntley to return to earth.
Two men pilot their own rocket to the moon. They find it inhabited by people wearing briefs. (The people are actually semi-nude on the moon.) The first 25 minutes is dedicated to the two men planning the trip. The next 35 minutes is a type of musical voyeurism. They go home but forget to take the evidence, and no proof that they went anywhere.
