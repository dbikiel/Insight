Johnny Knoxville and company return for the third installment of their TV show spin-off, where dangerous stunts and explicit public displays rule.
'Jackass 3D' opens with the entire cast all lined up, each wearing a different color of the rainbow, in front of a rainbow colored background, each in turn being attacked in various ways. Some of the footage is slowed down for maximal effect. This is repeated again at the end of the movie with additional explosions mixed in with gallons of water to wash away the cast- chaos is resumed. Throughout the movie the team are subjected to the usual foray of physical abuse from team members or perform hilarious stunts (including some of the more stomach turning stunts such as the Sweat suit cocktail, Toy Train Eruption and Poo Cocktail Supreme - not for the weak stomached!).
Some of the stunts included are:-Electric Avenue: the guys, dressed as convicts, try to negotiate a narrow hallway filled with tires while tasers hang from various parts.-Tee Ball: Dunn and Steve-O play a different kind of tee ball game.-Helicockter: Knoxville ties a radio-controlled helicopter to Pontius' penis and flies it.-The Blue Room: The guys play a prank on Dunn as he uses a porta-potty.-Pin the Tail on the Donkey: Danger Ehren plays a literal game of pin the tail on the donkey.
