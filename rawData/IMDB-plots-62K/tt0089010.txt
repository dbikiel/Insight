Carl Monroe and 'Joker' Johnson share some things: They are both in jail and they both hate each other. After a fist fight the are going to be put into an other jailhouse by car. They come to blows so wild that their transport has an accident. They manage to escape chained to each other, still hating each other and the sheriff hunting them.
