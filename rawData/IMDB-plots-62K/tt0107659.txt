A spoof on Lethal Weapon (1987), other movies, TV commercials etc. 2 unlike LA cops investigate a cocaine in girl scout cookies case.
A Los Angeles detective is murdered because she has microfilm with the recipe to make cocaine cookies. A "Lethal Weapon"-style cop team tries to find and stop the fiends before they can dope the nation by distributing their wares via the "Wilderness Girls" cookie drive.
In this parody of buddy-cop comedies, General Curtis Mortars (William Shatner) and Mr. Jigsaw (Tim Curry) are lacing Wilderness Girls cookies with cocaine. It's up to Sergeants Jack Colt (Emilio Estevez) and Wes Luger (Samuel L. Jackson), as well as Sergeant Billy York (Whoopi Goldberg) informant Tim Becker (Jon Lovitz), to put a stop to this.
