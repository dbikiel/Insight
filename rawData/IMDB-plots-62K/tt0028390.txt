Max Hare is boxing Toby Tortoise, and beating him severely in round one. Between rounds, a Mae West lookalike tells Toby she "likes a man who takes his time", which seems to reinvigorate him. Come round two, Toby pulls into his shell to avoid the fists, wears a diving helmet to survive the water Max pours in, and when Max fills his shell with fireworks, manages to turn them back against Max.
