The spirits of dead Indians are haunting a couple's house, and they call in an exorcist, whose trademark is a black whip, to get rid of them.
After an Indian medicine man dies, his house, which was built over the graves of four Indian sorcerers becomes a sorority home for a group of girls. Once the four Indians are awakened and terror ensues, a park ranger learns of the Indian's evil and plans to stop them.
