Lisa Templeton begins a new job as a cleaner at High Hopes Hospital, a mental institution in Amityville, Long Island. Initially delighted to get the job, Lisa soon realises that all is not as it seems. Intimidated by staff and the psychotic ramblings of the patients, she is further unnerved by apparent supernatural occurrences on the night shift. To preserve her sanity Lisa must uncover the mysterious history of the institution and it's inmates. But the truth is far more terrifying than she could ever imagine.
For decades, the evil energy of the grisly DeFeo murders in Amityville has driven people crazy, forcing them to commit atrocious acts of violence. Now--as the young unemployed woman, Lisa Templeton, takes on a job as a janitor at the High Hopes psychiatric hospital--disturbing paranormal incidents within the institution's thick walls start to affect the newly hired employee. More and more, an ancient dark force grows in strength; however, no one seems to believe Lisa. Will the innocent janitor get out of the infernal ward in one piece? Has anyone ever escaped from the hellish Amityville Asylum?
