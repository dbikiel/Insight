Brazil's history during the 20th Century serves as a background to Luiz Carlos Prestes's curious course. The Knight of Hope, as he was known, took part in the epic march of rebellious soldiers in the '20s, when he could testify Brazilian people's misery. After that, he became a communist and started to fight for more justice in his country.
