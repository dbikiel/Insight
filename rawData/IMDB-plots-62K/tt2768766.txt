His cinematic writing narrates encounters with remarkable people of mind and meditation; a runaway kid, a Sadhu, a mother who has lost her son, a Yoga Guru who found an abandoned baby, and a Ganja (cannabis) supplying Holy man. A meditation on time and faith expressed in words and images, "Faith Connections" tries to explore the power of devotion.
Filmmaker Pan Nalin travels to Kumbh Mela, one of the world's most extraordinary religious events. There, he encounters remarkable men of mind and meditation, some facing an inextricable dilemma; to embrace the world or to renounce it. FAITH CONNECTIONS explores such diverse and deeply moving stories as a young runaway kid, a Sadhu, a mother desperately looking for her lost son, a yogi who is raising an abandoned baby, and an ascetic who keeps his calm by smoking cannabis - all connected by one faith against the spectacular display of devotion.
