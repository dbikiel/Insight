When the mother of his infant son unexpectedly passes away, struggling actor Mark grapples with fatherhood and his inability to grow up. And when he sparks with a single mother, he learns how his choices have real-life consequences.
Mark is an actor, recently widowed and the father of two year old Isaac. Beyond Mark's time with Isaac who he truly loves, Mark's life is a mess. He is struggling as an actor, always hoping but somewhat delusional about his chances at getting the acting jobs for which he's auditioned. He makes no attempt at earning a living in any other manner. As such, he often needs to borrow money from his friends, always saying that the money will be returned soon. They share an apartment with Tim and Ray - it being Tim's apartment - and are behind in paying Tim rent, their share which Tim has to cover in the meantime. Mark wants to lead the Hollywood actor life, which is made all the more difficult in being Isaac's sole caregiver. Mark has intimacy issues stemming solely from the last encounter he had with his wife before her tragic accidental death. All these issues combined lead to Mark not being able to provide Isaac with much of a life, again beyond the time that they are able to spend together. Mark's life may take a turn when he and Isaac meet Lydia, the owner/operator of a children's playspace. Lydia is a single mother herself of adolescent Bebel. Mark and Lydia are attracted to each other. Lydia's life is more put together than Mark's, and their relationship may have that hurdle of Mark's intimacy issue to survive.
