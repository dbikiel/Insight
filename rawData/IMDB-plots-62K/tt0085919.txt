An English teacher and struggling single mother has her life disrupted when the father who abandoned her as a child comes back into her life.
Nora is a single mother who lives with her son Michael in a small house. They don't have much money but at least they have each other. Out of the blue comes Nora's father Max Dugan, who left her and her mother when Nora was nine years old. He brings a suitcase with dollar bills and showers her and Michael with gifts, trying to make up for lost time, knowing that he has a fatal heart ailment. The money comes from his shady career in Las Vegas and Nora is dating a policeman who is very interested in meeting him.
A down-on-her luck single mom gets a new lease on life when her long-lost father returns with some shady money with the hopes of spending some time with the grandson he's never met.
