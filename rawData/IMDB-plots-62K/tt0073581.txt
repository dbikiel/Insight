Uuno is unemployed and his friends try to arrange a job for him. With his imagination and the help of HÃ¤rski Hartikainen, he somehow manages to avoid all work, until he becomes what he has always dreamed of being: a film star. Uuno's father-in-law has other plans for his occupation, though: since Uuno knows the Dandelion, he has potential for a professor of botany.
