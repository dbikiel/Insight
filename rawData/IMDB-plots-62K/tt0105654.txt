A songwriter in love with his demanding boss's secretary enters an alternate, wacky world where a much-needed hit tune may be created from his heart.
Del is a song writer for the obnoxious Mr. Mega, and in love with Didi, Mega's secretary. His quest to write a hit tune brings him to the wacky world of Flooby Nooby, where he just might learn to write songs from the heart.
A songwriter is given 47 minutes to write a hit or lose his job and his sweetheart in Bill Plympton's critically acclaimed full-length feature film "THE TUNE." Written by Plympton and P. C. Vey (author of "If Cats Could Talk'), along with songwriter Maureen McElheron (who also scored "Your Face"), the film was released nationwide and is currently being featured on the Bravo Channel. Featuring ten songs that each pay homage to different forms of American popular music, "THE TUNE" follows the adventures of Del, a nerdy carrot-topped songwriter, after he takes a wrong exit from a cloverleaf and finds himself stranded in Flooby Nooby, a strange and unfamiliar farming town. He is led around by the town's mayor and learns from the townspeople how to write songs from the heart and not from a rhyming dictionary. Along the way he meets an astonishing array of characters, including a psycho-babbling guru and even a hip-swiveling canine Elvis impersonator.
