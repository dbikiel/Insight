A rich but unscrupulous old woman plots with a scientist to have her brain implanted in the skull of a sexy young woman.
Somehow, atomic power is harnessed to transplant brains. An old woman uses this power to hire two sexy (and one homely) foreign housekeepers with the idea of transplanting her old brain into a sexy woman's.
Mrs. March, sadistic, selfish, and wealthy, uses her aging gigolo boyfriend and renegade scientist Otto Frank, whose illegal experiments she is subsidizing in her Gothic mansion, in a plan to transplant her brain into the body of a young woman. Three foreign domestics: Mexican Anita, British Bea, and Austrian Nina, are hired. Frank's mysterious and unexplained use of radiation can inexplicably transplant brains without surgery. After he puts a cat's brain into Anita, and she literally scratches out Bea's eye, Nina becomes the prospective receptacle for Mrs. March's aging but still active libido.
