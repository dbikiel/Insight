Fast-talking con-man and grifter Candy Johnson rises to be the corrupt boss of Yellow Creek, but his wife's alcoholic father tries to set things right.
"Candy" Johnson, a great crook of the Wild West, decides to find a town where he could become a big boss. To achieve this, he will need to conceal his true identity and not only pretend to be an honest man, but lead the struggle against the corrupt sheriff. No one in town realizes that the anti-corruption hero is just a greater crook himself. And there is only one person who is stronger than Johnson - a girl he is in love with.
