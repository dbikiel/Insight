Fake documentary about a fictional Hollywood film studio.
Satirical mockumentary that celebrates the history of Adequate Pictures, a fictitious prolific low-budget Hollywood movie studio that delivered some of the most adequate films out there during its 60 years long run. The host, Tony Randall, and TV personality, Joe Franklin, interview several key people behind the studio including the owner, Max Roebling, who's more than willing to give the dirt on everyone he worked with. The clips from his movies, such as "Einstein on the Bounty," "Little Elroy Meets Baby Frankenstein," and "Slut of the South" are also shown. The movie features various celebrity cameos ranging from Robert Downey Jr. and Bruce Willis to Robert Vaughan, who played Hitler in one of Max's movies.
