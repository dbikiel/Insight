When the patriarch of the family passes away, the teenage children must take responsibility for the family chores: the preparation of the rituals, the hunting and putting the all-important meat on the table. These newfound responsibilities are even more daunting, however, when you live in the city and happen to be a family of cannibals.
In Mexico, the patriarch of a family of cannibals dies in a shopping mall. He is a watchmaker that supports his family and his sons Alfredo and Julián go to the street market to work in his booth. However the manager evicts them from the market since their father owes three-week rental to her. When they return home, their sister Sabina informs that their father has died in the mall. While the three siblings discuss who will be the family provider for their rituals, their mother Patricia locks herself in a room. Alfredo and Julián initially assume the responsibility but they are clumsy and soon two corrupt police detectives track them down.
