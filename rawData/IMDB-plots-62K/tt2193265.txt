A company retreat on a tropical island goes terribly awry.
Eager to climb the corporate ladder, the nice guy and low-level office drone, Chris, sees his hard work go down the drain when an arrogant and conniving co-worker steals his brilliant idea and lands an important client. Under those circumstances, the tough ex-Marine and determined team-building coach, Storm Rothschild, leads the mismatched office team to a remote tropical island for a mandatory two-day character-building course. However, there, on the secluded haven, whatever can go wrong will go wrong, as ravenous ambition, unpunished rebellion, frail allegiances, and even a ferocious man-eating tiger get in the way of the stranded employees' safe return to civilisation. Does the team have what it takes to survive?
