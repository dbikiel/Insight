Elliot heads for the sexual fantasy island, Eden. He takes some photos of diamond smugglers. They and undercover cops want the photos and follow him to Eden.
Elliot is going to the island of Eden to live out his submissive fantasies, but inadvertently photographs diamond smugglers at work. Smugglers, and detectives, follow him to the island, where they try to retrieve the film. Elliot begins falling in love with Lisa, the head mistress of the island, and Lisa must evaluate her feelings about Elliot and her own motivations.
Troubled by his own repressed sexuality, Elliot embarks on a trip to an island of libertinage and sexual release, not realising he has become the target for a criminal's vendetta. Two cops are close behind, and have to go deep undercover to discover what's going on amongst the submission and bondage - and Elliot's growing love for Mistress Lisa.
