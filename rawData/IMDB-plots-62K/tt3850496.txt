A home care nurse works with terminally ill patients.
David is an in-home nurse who works with terminally ill patients. Efficient and dedicated to his profession, David develops strong, even intimate, relationships with each person he cares for. But outside of his work, David is ineffectual, awkward, and reserved-effects of his chronic depression-and he needs each patient as much as they need him. Having long carried a burden of guilt and remorse, David must face his past in order to heal.
