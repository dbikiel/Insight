After the murder of his wife, vegetarian restaurant chef and critic Matt pursues an online relationship with Callie who owns a guest house on an island. Problems occur when he arrives on the isolated island, to the surprise of Callie, to find she lives there with her strange sisters Lydia and Tess. Guests begin to disappear one by one and when Matt's friend and fellow chef, Ryan, turns up after receiving a strange text message, it soon becomes clear that all is not what it seems and he can't trust ANYONE on the island.
