The Accident, The Image, The Obsession.
What drives someone to pursue scenes of death and suffering? From the age of nine, avid cinephile Enrique Metinides was photographing corpses in the street. Despite his age, this passion soon landed him a job in the tabloids, where he was given license to follow his morbid obsession. Through his work we explore Mexico City, as seen through the prism of its crime scenes, and delve into the human fascination with the macabre.
