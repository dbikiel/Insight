The tragic accident of an Italian laborer ,working on the Mont Blanc tunnel.
A TV journalist and his assistant come to interview a sociologist whose books deal with world hunger (and one may wonder what he is doing here in a rather cozy house whereas other people go out on the field,nursing ,helping ,teaching?).We are given a small lecture on that crucial problem. In parallel,we are told the tragic accident of an Italian laborer ,Mario Ricci,working on the Mont Blanc tunnel.A garage owner seems to be responsible for his death ,but in the hotel where the journalists are staying,another side of the story is slowly spreading. .
