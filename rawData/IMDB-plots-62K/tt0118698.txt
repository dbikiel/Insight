In 1930s Berlin, a gay Jew is sent to a concentration camp under the Nazi regime.
Max is gay and as such is sent to Dachau concentration camp under the Nazi regime. He tries to deny he is gay, and gets a yellow label (the one for Jews) instead of pink (the one for gays). In camp, he falls in love with fellow prisoner Horst, who wears his pink label with pride.
Max is a promiscuous gay man living in 1930s Berlin. He is at odds with his wealthy family because of his homosexuality. One evening, much to the resentment of his boyfriend, Rudy, Max brings home a handsome Sturmabteilung (S.A.) man. Unfortunately, he does so on the Night of the Long Knives, when Hitler ordered the assassination of upper echelon S.A. corps. The Sturmabteilung man is discovered and killed by S.S. men in Max and Rudy's apartment, and the two have to flee Berlin. Max's Uncle Freddie has organized new papers for Max, but Max refuses to leave his boyfriend behind. As a result, Max and Rudy are found and arrested by the Gestapo and put on a train headed for Dachau. On the train, Rudy is brutally beaten to death by the guards. As Rudy calls out to Max when he is taken away, Max lies to the guards, denying he is gay. In the camp, Max falls in love with Horst, who shows him the dignity that lies in acknowledging one's beliefs.
