An ex-felon discovers a live baby left in a dumpster.
About a convict -Russ Millings - who has just been released from prison after serving 20 years for possessing an ounce of marijuana. The world outside, changed beyond his recognition, seems like seen through a glass pane and moves at a different pace. He diligently fulfills his tasks, but human contact is a forgotten and scary concept to him. Still on parole and working in a burger joint, one night he finds an abandoned baby in a dumpster. Unsure of what to do, and caught between being overwhelmed by affection and panic, Russ starts to 'thaw'. He finally finds connection to another human - and himself, through this baby which is lost, cast out and ignorant of the world around her- like him. He dares to come out of his emotional shell and go on the journey to retrace his past persona from that distant time 'before' , when he was Russky: A person, a son, a man and not a subject.
