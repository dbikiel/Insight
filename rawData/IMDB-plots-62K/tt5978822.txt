Chaos prevails when a family prepares for a lavish wedding.
What happens when you throw in an insecure virgin bride, a reformed playboy groom, two overbearing mothers who can't stand each other, one philandering husband, a high-strung wedding planner, the invasion of unruly village gate- crashes, a thief on the loose, a best man with a flashdrive full of secrets, a sexy EX with vengeance on her mind, two loyal bridesmaids ready to go to war, and a brother seeking his father's approval? A HILARIOUS melting pot of potential disaster. Will it all be too much? Or will true love stand even the most chaotic of wedding celebrations as offered in The Wedding Party?
