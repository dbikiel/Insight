Exploring the somewhat darker and more mysterious side of Lewis Carroll's classic book, the movie follows Alice Liddell Hargreaves (Coral Browne) (the book's inspiration) as an old woman who is haunted by the characters, by whom she was once so amused. As she thinks back on it, she starts to see her relationship with Reverend Charles L. Dodgson/Lewis Carroll (Sir Ian Holm) in a new way, and realizes the vast change between the young Alice and the old.
In 1932, Alice Liddell Hargreaves (Coral Browne), age eighty, travels to New York City to attend a celebration of Reverend Charles L. Dodgson's/Lewis Carroll's (Sir Ian Holm's) centenary. Confused by American culture and unable to understand the huge popularity of the Alice books, Mrs. Hargreaves begins to remember details of the childhood events that led to the writing of the stories. Was shy Carroll actually in love with her?
