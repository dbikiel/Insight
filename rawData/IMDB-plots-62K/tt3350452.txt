A trip through the diversity of black and native Peruvian music.
A film about characters, characters who are part of a country. Although the film talks about music and musicians, it is not strictly a musical but rather a reflection on personal stories apparently very far apart, stories that look for one another in a country also immersed in the struggle to find itself and create its own identity: Peru.
