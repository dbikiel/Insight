After discovering the truth about being stolen by the woman he thought was his mother as a child, Pierre (AKA Felipe) must deal with the consequences of his mother's actions and must try to cope with his biological family.
Pierre is seventeen and in the middle of puberty. He plays in a band, has sex at parties and secretly tries on women's clothing and lipstick in front of a mirror. Ever since his father's death, his mother Aracy has looked after him and his younger sister Jacqueline, spoiling them both. But when he discovers that she stole him from a hospital when he was a new born baby, Pierre's life changes dramatically.
