A Dutch woman escapes her family life in search for happiness in the Portuguese Algarve.
Julia has a dull job, lives in a Vinex district, has two children with the incredibly decent Paul and takes antidepressants. Not exactly the adventurous life she once promised her dying young brother Jimmy to live. They parted tragically twenty years ago, but it still hurts. After an argument with Paul, Julia decides to radically alter the course of her life. She departs in Jimmys spirit for the Portuguese Algarve; the end of the world. She makes new friends and takes on a new look, but soon discovers escaping is not the same as becoming happy. When she meets the mysterious gigolo Romeo, her past comes closer than ever.
