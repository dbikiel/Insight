Leigh has lived a reclusive existence in a secluded old home on the outskirts of town for her entire adult life. You see, Leigh has excreted extremely potent pheromones ever since puberty, so anyone with the ability to smell is affected by Leighs presence. Guy is a wandering handyman who ends up on Leigh's property. When he doesn't act maniacally attracted to her at first sight, Leigh realizes that there is something special about this Guy. As it turns out, Guy has no sense of smell.
