Thanks to his irresponsible father, teenager Young-jae spent most of his childhood in a group home called 'Issac's House'. After years at the group home, he is almost at the age where he has to leave. Knowing that he cannot possibly go back to his father, he lies to the principal that he will become a priest and devote himself to God in order to continue living there. Meanwhile, he also shuns his only friend Beom-tae when his drastic action puts both of them in a dire position. All gets worse when one day out of the blue, his father visits and checks his little brother Min-jae into the home as well, which only fuels him with rage and despair.
