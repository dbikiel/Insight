A time capsule of teenage life in the 1980s.
In 1984--before cell phones, the web, and reality TV, a young filmmaker set out to document a year in the life of a typical California high school. The result was "All American High", an unusually honest and humorous look at 80's teen life. Told through the eyes of a visiting exchange student, the film presents an uncensored view of senior year in the era of big hair, punks, and parachute pants. Thirty years after they lived it, the film's original subjects return in "All American High Revisited" to look back at one of the most memorable chapters of their lives.
