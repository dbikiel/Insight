Thrown out of the Riviera, a family of grifters meets a lonely, vulnerable rich old woman and insinuate themselves into her life while they sponge off her.
The Carletons make a living as card sharps and finding new suckers to mooch off of. When their latest scam backfires, they are asked to leave Monte Carlo. At the train station, they meet a kind old woman named Miss Fortune. The elderly lady is very wealthy and very lonely. As a reward for saving her life after the train derails, Miss Fortune invites the Carletons to come live with her. The family hopes that by winning her affection, they can eventually be named sole beneficiaries in her will. But will a change of heart soften their mercenary feelings before that time comes?
Actor Thomas Higgins has taken on the persona of one of his well-to-do stage characters, ex-Bengal Lancer Colonel Anthony 'Sahib' Carleton. His family has too followed and are now known as the Carletons. They are doing this in an effort to live off the rich and wealthy who are willing to flaunt their riches on the Carletons. On the train to London from the French Riviera from where they were thrown out by the local authorities for their grifting ways, the Carletons meet Ellen Fortune, a lonely elderly woman who has recently come into a fortune. Miss Fortune invites the Carletons to stay with her. The Carleton's daughter, George-Anne, sees this situation as the permanent answer to their life: they lead a straight life with Miss Fortune, including getting jobs, in the probability that she will deed her entire estate to them. In their time with Miss Fortune, the elderly woman may have more of an effect on the Carletons than the other way around.
