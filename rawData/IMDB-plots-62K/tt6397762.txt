A pregnant 17-year-old decides to keep her condition to herself, enjoying a calm life in Puerto Vallarta. But, why on earth hadn't the inexperienced mother-to-be sought for assistance earlier? Can a mere child raise a kid on her own?
Valeria is 17 and pregnant. She lives in Puerto Vallarta with Clara, her half sister. Valeria has not wanted her long-absent mother, April, to find out about her pregnancy, but due to the economic strain and the overwhelming responsibility of having a baby in the house, Clara decides to call their mother. April arrives, willing to her daughters, but we soon understand why Valeria had wanted her to stay away.
For fear of the reaction of her absent and distant mother, April, the outgoing and happily-pregnant seventeen-year-old, Valeria, decides to keep her condition to herself, living under the same roof with her polar-opposite half-sister, Clara, in a cosy beach house in sunny Puerto Vallarta. However, the underage mother-to-be's carefree life will be abruptly interrupted, when a caring, non-judgemental, and totally supportive April arrives to check in on her girls. But, why on earth hadn't the inexperienced Valeria sought for April's precious assistance earlier? After all, how can a mere child raise a kid on her own?
