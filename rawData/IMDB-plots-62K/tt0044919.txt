In Oklahoma, outlaw Belle Starr joins the Dalton gang but she causes a romantic rivalry and a rift between the gang members, especially on the eve of the planned robbery of a bank where a posse is secretly waiting in ambush.
In a fictionalized biography, Oklahoma outlaw Belle Starr meets the Dalton gang when rescued from lynching by Bob Dalton, who falls for her. So do gang member Mac and wealthy saloon owner Tom Bradfield, who's enlisted in a bankers' scheme to trap the Daltons. Dissension among the gang and Bradfield's ambivalence complicate the plot, as Belle demonstrates her prowess with shootin' irons, horses, and as a surprisingly racy saloon entertainer.
