Korengal picks up where Restrepo left off; the same men, the same valley, the same commanders, but a very different look at the experience of war.
Picks up where Restrepo left off. Once again we meet the men of Battle Company, 2nd Battalion, 503nd Infantry Regiment, 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team in 2007-8. They are deployed at one of the most dangerous places on earth - certainly the most dangerous place, at the time, for US forces: the Korengal Valley in Afghanistan. Journalist Sebastian Junger and photojournalist Tim Hetherington were embedded with the 2nd Platoon of B Company and captured their daily lives.
