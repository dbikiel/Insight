A Cape Town couple, Katherine and Hugh, are headed to their mountain getaway, when they pick up a young woman hitchhiker, Liza, who carries a gun and may or may not be the devil herself.
Quarrelling Cape Town lovers Hugh, and Kate, are on their way to their weekend "love shack" nestled high in the Cederberg when they pass a young young girl hitchhiking by the roadside. Katherine is suspicious of this beautiful stranger wearing tight denim "Daisy Duke" shorts but gives in to Hugh and they stop and give her a lift. Liza becomes quite reticent when asked about her personal affairs, but she does tell them that she's from "an alien planet" in "nowhere" enroute to their mountain getaway. Seeing she's hungry when they give her an apple, they invite her back to Katherine's home for lunch oblivious to the danger that they've brought into their lives. bcarruthers-76500
The number 1 rule for driving on South African roads is never pick up a hitchhiker because you never know who or what you're "guest" is going to be. In a country where 49 people are murdered every day. Someone should have reminded Hugh and Katherine about that. NEVER PICK UP A HITCHHIKER!!!!
