An aging cowboy finds to his embarrassment that the successful business he has inherited from his brother is actually a house of prostitution.
Out of the blue, the grizzled farm hand, John O'Hanlan, receives an unexpected letter from an unknown solicitor in the far off town of Cheyenne, Wyoming, informing him that he is the proud owner of the Cheyenne Social Club, now that his estranged brother, D.J., has passed away. Eager to trade in the dusty landscapes of 1867 Texas for an easy life as a businessman--and at the same time intrigued--John sets out on a long trip along with his best friend, Harley Sullivan, to create a better future for himself. Somehow, John's newest and only acquisition has both a good and a bad reputation; either way, the establishment's inexperienced manager now holds the fates of its loyal staff in his hands: a beautiful sextet of dedicated, and above all, popular female employees. However, is John cut out for business?
John is working as a cow poke for very little money with his friend Harley when he gets word his brother DJ has died and bequeathed him the Cheyenne Social Club. He and Harley ride for nearly a thousand miles to his inheritance and discover it's a high class brothel.
