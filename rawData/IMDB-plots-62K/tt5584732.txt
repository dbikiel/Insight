A vicious serial killer is targeting prostitutes in Vienna, Austria. A tough young woman from Turkey, who works as a taxi driver, witnesses one of the murders and becomes a target. The police are of no help, so she must stop him herself.
Özge Dogruol is a young woman who left Turkey to find a better life for herself in Austria. She finds work as a cab driver in its capital, Vienna, but frequently faces hostility and intolerance from both her customers and the local police. In order to vent, she takes kickboxing classes and never backs down from a fight, even with police officers, if necessary, to make things right. Meanwhile, the city is plagued by a sadistic serial killer with seemingly religious motives, who targets, tortures and murders a very specific kind of prostitutes. On her way from work one day, Özge witnesses the murder of her next door neighbor, the serial killer's latest victim, and sees the killers face. Unfortunately, he notices Özge as well and tries to kill her. Özge turns to the police, where she's met only with skepticism. Failing to kill her, the killer goes after her extended family in Vienna next, which forces Özge to find a way to stop him herself, and her only ally is a lone police detective who's seemingly ready to bent the rules in order to help her in her mission.
