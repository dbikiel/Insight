The grandson of the world's first and foremost consulting detective and his bumbling, bionic sidekick attempt to catch the only living descendant of Professor Moriarty.
The grandchild of Professor James Moriarty had promised the world that it has only five days left to live. Moriarty is a master of disguise, a crack shot, and is very patient. Several government figures are shot to death, and it seems that it truly is the end of civilization as we know it- until the President learns that the grandson of Sherlock Holmes is living at 221B Baker Street, and send the Police Commisioner of Scotland Yard to employ him. Unfortunately, Arthur Sherlock Holmes is a quick-tempered, ranting, violent bungler, and his assistant, Dr. William Watson (grandson of Dr. John H. Watson) is one of the most moronic creatures ever to walk the earth, although he is invaluable because he has "bionic bits". Holmes has inherited a drug habit from his grandfather, one which his housekeeper, Mrs. Hudson, is less than discreet about, and the sleek Moriarty is also one step ahead of him, eventually murdering the police commisioner. Finally, Holmes decides to hold a party, inviting the world's most distinguished detectives, hoping to flush Moriarty out of hiding. However, it does not go as planned.
