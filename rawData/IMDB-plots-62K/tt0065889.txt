A chief of detectives, homicide section, kills his mistress and deliberately leaves clues to prove his own responsibility for the crime.
In a time of internal political disturbance, Roman police inspector Gian Maria Volontè gets that plum assignment: crack down on political dissidents; then proceeds to slash the throat of married mistress Florinda Bolkan ("a beautiful, kinky masochist" - Vincent Canby). But as homicide cops swarm over the murder scene, guess who gets tapped to head the investigation? And, as every clue unearthed - most perversely planted by Volontè himself - leads right back to... is anybody going to do anything about it? Investigation becomes a biting critique of Italian police methods and authoritarian repression, a psychological study of a budding crypto-fascist, a probing why-dun nit, and a buildup to a question-stamped finale.
