An elite commando unit must rescue a captured peacekeeping force from a ruthless international arms dealer.
An international peace-keeping force is trying to keep relations between two Middle-Eastern nations from exploding into open warfare. When one of the patrols disappears in the desert, a group of soldiers from different nations is thrown together to go look for them. After being fired upon by some Arab soldiers, the patrol discovers that one of the sides has smuggled a nuclear weapon and is planning to use it to bring the fighting to its ultimate end.
