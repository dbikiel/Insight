When twins Sarah and Julie feel like their mom is tired of them, they take off on an exciting adventure to their great-grandmother's house and encounter a pair of villains along the way.
Delivery-truck driver Eddie Popko, a dreamy wannabe-cowboy, always flirts with convenience-store clerk Rhonda Thompson, but his enthusiasm dims when he meets her hostile 5-year-old twins, Sarah and Julie. When they hear her wish for a holiday without her handfuls, they sneak off to Great-Grandma Mimi's house; unable to find her or the right bus, they sneak into Eddie's truck. He takes to babysitting during his round, but when he delivers them home, he's knocked unconscious by dumb Harvey and mean Shirley, senior robbers who steal his truck, including the Christmas parcels and the twins--who have possession of the lottery tickets he bought in hopes of winning $1.3 million. He decides to help Rhonda and police detective Gremp with the search and even raises a 'borrowed' ransom.
Shortly before Christmas, rambunctious five-year-old twin sisters Julie and Sarah overhear their overworked mother Rhonda tell a friend that they're sometimes a handful and she wishes she could have a vacation. Feeling guilty about giving her such a hard time by frequenting fighting and competing with each other, the sister decide to give her a vacation by spending the holidays with Great-Grandma Mimi. They pack a bag and sneak out; now, she lives far away and they don't know how to get there. They soon run into Eddie, a delivery guy who has a crush on their mom, but before he can drive them back to her, two middle-aged robbers steal his truck, not knowing that the twins are inside. Now the police are looking for missing twins, a missing truck, and two robbers. With Eddie's help Rhonda sets out to get her girls back herself, but she might end up just making things worse.
