An angel disguises himself as a crusty old rancher in order to visit Earth and help an unborn child find suitable parents.
Two angels, Charles and Arthur, are sent down to retrieve a young girl who has selected the couple she wishes to be borne to but who are so involved in their theatrical lives that procreation doesn't get a look in. To try and ginger things up Charles materialises and poses as a rich potential backer for their next show, only to discover that life on earth can be quite fun.
