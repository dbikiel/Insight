Elephants disrupt the lives of a family deep in the jungles of Northern Siam, and an entire village.
Kru is a pioneer, living deeper in the jungle of northern Siam than any of his predecessors. He solves the problems caused by leopards and tigers attacking his stock by setting traps and killing those beasts. A baby chang (the Siamese word for elephant) is caught in his trap, and thinking he would tame it so it will work for him one day, he tethers it to a post under his house, which is on stilts. Its mother comes and destroys his house. Kru and his family flee to the village, where a mammoth herd of elephants suddenly appear and decimates the buildings in the village. But the villagers fight back.
