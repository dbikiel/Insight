The first part of the Lee Rock trilogy which chronicles the rise and fall of the corrupt police force that Lee Rock becomes a part of. Rock enters Hong Kong as an immigrant from the mainland. Despising poverty, Rock becomes a police officer. Being a clean officer made him little money so he decides to be like the other officers and become a crooked but fair officer. He's about to marry the woman of his dreams when tragedy strikes. But not even that can keep Lee Rock from rising to the top.
