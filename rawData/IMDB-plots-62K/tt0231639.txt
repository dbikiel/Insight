A woman being fitted for shoes exposes her ankle to the shoe clerk, who is intrigued. He kisses her, but her chaperone hits him with her umbrella.
A clerk looks over the bank of stacked shoe boxes on the wall behind him. Two women enter, perhaps a mother and her grown daughter, one in white and one in black, both wearing large hats. The younger of the two asks to see shoes while the older one, sitting on the far side of the clerk, reads. He shows the younger woman a sample, then another. She selects the second, and he puts it on her foot, taking his time with the buttons and buckles. She slowly raises her skirt to display her ankle and then her calf. He looks up at her. Wait a second - is he a heel or is this a planned assignation?
Interior of shoe-store. Young lady and chaperon enter. While a fresh young clerk is trying a pair of high-heeled slippers on the young lady, the chaperon seats herself and gets interested in a paper. The scene changes to a close view, showing the lady's foot and the clerk's hands tying the slipper. Her dress is slightly raised, showing a shapely ankle, and the clerk's hands begin to tremble, making it difficult for him to tie the slipper. The picture returns to the previous scene. The clerk makes rapid progress with his fair customer, and while he is in the act of kissing her the chaperon looks up and proceeds to beat the clerk with an umbrella. Then she takes the young lady by the arm, and leads her from the store.
