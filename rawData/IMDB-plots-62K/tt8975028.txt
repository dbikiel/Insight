2 men are chained up in a basement. The captor has cameras aimed at them and is streaming it on the internet - turning it into a "trial" on the held, retired judge's last court case. The viewers become the jurors.
An unidentified man posts a live feed on social media showing that he has kidnapped two strangers and intends to kill one before the day is out. His intention is to hold a capital "trial" online. As the authorities recognize what's happening, it becomes apparent that the online public is going to act as judge and jury.
