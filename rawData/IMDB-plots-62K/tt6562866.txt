Trevor Noah's Netflix one hour standup special. Amazing comedy covering race in America, immigration politics, international relations and more.
South African comedian Trevor Noah became famous as one of the correspondents for The Daily Show with John Stewart on Comedy Central. After Stewart retired in 2015, Noah became host of that program. But before appearing on that show, Trevor was a stand-up comedian. This film was recorded at the Beacon Theater in New York. He had been doing stand-up in other countries. Those experiences formed the basis of much of his comedy. Because he speaks many languages, much of his humor comes from observations he made while traveling around the world. He relies on humor using different accents and uses those accents commenting on problems both political and casual. His political humor goes from Brexit in Europe (England voting to withdraw from the European Union) to Barack Obama in the U. S. (coolest president ever). His casual humor goes from having a 'wee-little' drink in Scotland to the power of the vagina compared to the powerlessness of the penis. It isn't until almost an hour into the stage routing that he brings up the topic of being 'afraid of the dark'. Here again he uses accent humor to explain how he combats the fear: us a Russian accent. You will be in control and everybody else will be afraid.
