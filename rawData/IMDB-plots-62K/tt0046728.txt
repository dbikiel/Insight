Attorney, Purdom, and singer, Damone, romance two sisters, Reynolds and Powell, who live with and are strongly influenced by eccentric, health oriented and star gazing grandparents.
Athena Mulvain has attorney Adam Shaw reeling, and she knows he will marry her because the stars say so. The same goes for her sister Minerva and the idol of the bobbysoxers Johnny Nyle. But winning the girls also involves their weight-lifting grandfather, star-gazing grandmother and their five beautiful, gymnastic sisters. Adam and Johnny accept the health diet of molasses and yogurt and try to please the rest of the physical culture family, but trouble looms when Adam humiliates Grandpa's "Mr. America" protégé in a fight.
