A man and woman must face the tension that builds between them during a long-distance relationship.
The film recounts a long-distance relationship between two people, Mattie and James who are in love -one of whom lives in Chicago, the other in New York City. But too many mornings and too many miles apart have taken a toll on them. As they struggle with the distance, their visits become reminders of the difficulties, not the pleasures, of their relationship.
Mattie and James are in love and living in separate cities. But too many mornings and too many miles apart have taken a toll on them. As they both struggle with the distance between New York and Chicago, their visits become reminders of the difficulties rather than the pleasures of their relationship. Joe Swanberg and Greta Gerwig follow their collaborations on Hannah Takes The Stairs and LOL with an intimate portrayal of coupling, longing and raw emotional vulnerability. This time Swanberg co-stars with Gerwig, and Gerwig co-directs with Swanberg, creating a startlingly honest adult drama that Salon.com hails as "...erotic and electrifying. This is a new-school independent film with old-school integrity. Nights And Weekends is a knockout!" [D-Man2010]
