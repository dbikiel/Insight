When the launch of a mission to Mars goes awry due to sabotage, International Rescue is requested to assist in the mission's second attempt.
Zero-X, a manned exploration mission crashes during lift-off on its maiden flight. Two years later an investigative committee finally concludes sabotage, and decides to call on the services of International Rescue to oversee security at the impending second launch. The second Zero-X successfully reaches its destination, but encounters unexpected hazards, ultimately leading to another call for assistance on its return to Earth. International Rescue respond, and once again Thunderbirds are GO!
Sometime in the late twenty-first century, the space craft Zero-X is embarking on a manned mission to Mars, the first mission of its kind. Almost immediately after launching, Zero-X faces technical difficulties, forcing its crew to abort the mission and eject from the craft before it crashes back down to Earth into the sea. Two years later, a redesigned and reconstructed Zero-X is ready for a second manned attempt to reach Mars, which coincides with the Space Exploration Center's finding that the first mission was sabotaged. As such, they recruit the Thunderbirds - ex-astronaut Jeff Tracy and his four sons Scott Tracy, Virgil Tracy, Alan Tracy and Gordon Tracy, each in his own Thunderbird air craft - to oversee security. By their side in the Fab1 mobile center on Earth is the beautiful Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward. The Thunderbirds not only have to prevent possible sabotage a second time around, but also deal with any other possible technical difficulties that may arise that requires on hands support. Through the Thunderbirds' mission, Alan begins to feel under-appreciated in his role, which culminates with a life and death task for both himself and the crew of Zero-X.
