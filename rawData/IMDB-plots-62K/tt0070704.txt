Everybody is after the money stolen by Hook (Jim Brown) before he ended up in prison including the villainous head guard Capt. Stambell.
After a murderous heist Curtis Hook (Jim Brown) is caught by the police. The police, prisoners and guards want to know where he stashed the $1.5 million. When the place where he stashed the money is scheduled to be demolished Hook makes plans to get out of jail promptly.
Of the three perpetrators of the crime, only Curtis Hook makes it out alive from the heist of $1.5 million and large shipment of heroin from organized crime. Hook is caught by the police, but not before he is able to hide the money, and dispose of the drugs. Hook knows the authorities only have evidence for a couple of minor offenses and he believes he will be out of prison in a few years. But the authorities also know that he was behind the heist and the murder of his two associates. He also learns the drug syndicate, whose boss he is in jail with, has a bounty on his head. The authorities try to plea bargain with him to give up the money and the drugs in return for protection from the drug syndicate. Hook continues to maintain that he knows nothing about money or drugs. In prison he gets caught in the middle of a race war with Glover leading the white inmates and Macey the black inmates. Glover and his men are secretly controlled by an older inmate named Capiello, who wants to discover the whereabouts of the money and drugs. The corrupt head security guard, Captain Otis Stambell, also wants the money and drugs. Hook then learns that the place where he hid the money will soon be demolished, meaning that he has to find a way out of the prison sooner than expected.
