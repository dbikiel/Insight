A Latino comic's near-death experience forces him to revisit his personal and professional highs and lows.
JESSE SANCHEZ, an artist/comedian gives the performance of his life. During a New Year's party, Jesse fakes a suicide attempt wrapping a retractable dog leash around his neck, accidentally knocks himself out, and sinks into the waters of his bathtub. Jesse gets the chance to reflect, possibly for the last time, upon his life and love. Known for his envelope pushing performances, Jesse's near death experience bends reality to stage and back again. He takes the audience across the universe of his life's greatest love stories, his quest for fame and the connection both play in understanding who he is underneath it all. With a bump on his head and a bruise on his heart, Jesse finds his way, reconciling with the fates, emerging from the tub to return to the stage a new man...well, at least a man with one hell of a story to tell.
