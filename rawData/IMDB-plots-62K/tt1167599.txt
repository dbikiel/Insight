The story of a young Viking boy who accompanies his father, the chief of their village, and his men on their adventures -- and often is the person who uses his wit and instincts to help the men in their times of need.
Vicky is a viking-boy who lives with his parents Halvar and Ylva in the small village Flake. He is a typical viking boy, but rather fearful. He is also not very strong but smart. One day he sails with the grown up vikings out to the sea and to experience a great and funny adventure.
Village Flake's headman and drakar captain Halver fears his son Wickie, not typically muscular and daring but cautious and resourceful, may never prove a 'real Viking man'. Wickie proves brains can triumph even over father's muscle. The real test comes after all other village children are abducted in a rival chief's raid. Wickie joins the desperate rescue expedition and proves invaluable in escaping Sven the terrible's superior forces and, after bumping into a Chinese 'gost ship', at his destination, mythical Thule island's treasure-house tower.
