Joy can't let go of her ex, but doesn't seem to be able to fall for the new guy. In the meantime she keeps having casual sex with strangers.
Joy is a young woman living in Tel Aviv. She has a love-hate relationship with its casual sex scene. Her whole world is her apartment and the street where it's located. The same street in which her ex lives, the one who refuses to get in touch with her. Joy tried desperately to get him back and will not let him go. That, until she runs into Nir, a chatty intellectual type, who says and does whatever he wants. Nir inspires Joy. In her attempt to be free, like him, she will be cruel to others and develop an obsessive hunger for touch. The movie deals with urban loneliness within the Y generation. The young people of Tel Aviv who yearn for intimacy and are also terrified by it; who talk endlessly, but never say anything authentic.
