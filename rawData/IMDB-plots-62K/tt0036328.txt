Wallace Beery stars in this patriotic World War II drama about a tough retired Marine who is caught in the middle of the Philippines campaign, experiencing action, heroics, and tragedy. Gruff Sergeant Bailey has never actually been in combat, but when the Japanese invade, the untested leader finally sees battle, ironically as a civilian in charge of organizing the citizens' withdrawal.
