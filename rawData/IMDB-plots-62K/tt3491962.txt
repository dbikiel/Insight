After a bloody bank robbery in New Mexico, Henry's gang heads to the borders for a safe split of the loot, while a competent bounty hunter, Josiah, is after them. Soon, the bandits will find the perfect hideout to spend the night, unfortunately, however, there lives the family of pastor George Tildon, a religious man who lives by the word of God.
