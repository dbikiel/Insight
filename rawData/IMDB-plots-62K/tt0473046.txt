What if the moon never had existed?
The documentary starts with an imaginary disaster: Venus hitting the Earth and destroying both. A fantasy? Perhaps, but many astronomers, scientists and other experts believe that if the Moon didn't exist that would have happened already. With the help of some of these scientists, the documentary explores the benefits to our planet of its sole satellite by speculating on what Earth would have been like if it had not been there.
Without the moon, humans wouldn't exist. Life, if it had started at all, would be in its earliest stages of evolution. Days would last four hours, winds would blow at hurricane force and there would be a dense and toxic atmosphere resembling that of Venus. Around 50 million years after the formation of the solar system, a Mars-sized planet called Orpheus hit the newly formed Proto-Earth. The blast sent planetary material from the pair into orbit around earth which eventually formed the Moon. In this one-hour special, viewers learn what Earth was like before the moon creating impact, and what Earth would have been like if the moon had never existed.
