A Chicago cop quits the force and finds himself threatened by the Mafia.
Set along the highways of the U.S. heartland, the story follows the journey of an ex-cop who is inadvertently thrust into a fierce struggle between the FBI and the Chicago underworld, both of which are searching for a missing federal agent who holds the key to the syndicate's demise.
Boomer, a special agent in Chicago, is asked to infiltrate in a gang. But something goes horribly wrong and his colleague Carlos is murdered right in front of his eyes. Boomer decides to leave the police force and reunite with the love of his life, Kelly. She hated his work and moved to Cedar Falls. On his way, he gets robbed of his car and is picked up by a guy who calls himself Flash. He seems friendly at first, but then mentions he is on the run for assassins. Boomer answers his phone in the car. A woman recognizes his voice as that of a certain Harry James. It's a name Boomer will not forget. James is a special agent who is sought for by both mob and authorities. Soon both groups will think Boomer's the one they're looking for.
