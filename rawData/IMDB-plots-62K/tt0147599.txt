A free-lancing gangster starts a one-man revenge war, battling a crime boss and his corrupt police partners - then the Mafia steps in to settle the score. With Rebecca De Mornay, Andre Braugher.
On loan from Chicago mafia to Detroit underworld, a thief gets double-crossed by the Detroit boss, and, after barely escaping, vows to take revenge. Aided by two of his close friends, and, pursued by a dogged detective, the thief proceeds to burn Detroit underworld to the ground.
Two master thieves go at odds with one another as one sets the other up for a crime. The first, a suave pro who does his job and then hides in his own privacy, listening to old jazz records and caring for his ailing dog, Wally. The other is a local gangster with a taste for the finer life, who decides to eliminate the competition. This ignites a war between the two men and their aides. An angry mob boss and a female police officer try to sort the mess before things get too out of hand.
