A young college co-ed tries joining the elite, all-male, secret society, the Skulls, and in so doing, she uncovers some unscrupulous methods used by some of the members to get what they want.
Taylor Brooks is a young, overachieving coed at a posh New England college who decides to pledge The Skulls, the secret society of which her father and many of the faculty are members, and for which her older brother died years earlier during an initiation rite. Her resolve to break the all-male Skulls' taboo against female membership by aggressively campaigning to be its first female entrant puts her at odds with most other pledges and alumni members. When she finally succeeds in fulfilling her goal, despite interference from a few Skull members, she finds herself in hot water, with her boyfriend murdered and herself accused of the crime. Taylor must find a way to prove her innocence and find the real killer despite the fact that no one around her can be trusted.
