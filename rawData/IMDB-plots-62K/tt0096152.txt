A young lawyer, after falling in love with a beautiful woman, finds that she has an extremely mysterious past.
Across a dark street in Los Angeles, a beautiful young woman is being brutally assaulted by an abusive boyfriend. Young lawyer Jeff Mills rushes to the woman's defense - and crosses into a world of unimaginable evil. On the surface, the young woman, Miranda Reed, is a dream come true, the perfect lover, a miracle healer and a soulmate. Before two days have passed, Jeff lives a real-life nightmare, an encounter so intense, death is almost merciful. Because Jeff learns that Miranda is a fugitive from the witches coven (to which she belongs) and they want her back. Back in time for a human sacrifice by the Unholy Night of the Winter Solstice.
In Los Angeles, the successful lawyer Jeff Mills plays a game after hour with his colleagues. When he comes to the parking area with his friend Derek Clayton, they see a stranger hitting a young woman and Jeff and Derek protect her. Then she explains that her name is Miranda Reed and she lives with the man named Aldys. Jeff brings her home and they have one night stand; but she moves to Jeff's apartment and they start living together. When Aldys finds Jeff, Miranda vanishes and he seeks the police department to report the disappearance of Miranda. Lieutenant Lee sees the photo of Miranda and asks him about her necklace. Soon Jeff learns that it is the symbol of a satanic sect that worships the devil. Out of the blue, Miranda reappears and explains to Jeff that her mother is a witch that introduced her to her coven. She is trying to leave them and she needs to miss the next solstice, when they will gather at a beach to sacrifice a human being that will spontaneously participate of the meeting and take his heart. When Miranda is abducted by the worshipers, Jeff decides to seek her out.
