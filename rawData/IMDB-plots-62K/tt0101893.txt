After his murder attempt on a private detective was foiled, James vows to defeat the Flash as the costumed crook, The Trickster. With his insane genius making him seemingly the only villian who can counter the superhero's incredible speed with mundane materials, The Flash has a real fight on his hands.

Then he becomes The Trickster and is obsessed for Megan, but The Flash protects her. The Flash decides to challenge The Trickster and he finally arrests the criminal. However, during the trial he is helped by The Prank, who has a crush on him, and he escapes from the justice, promising revenge against The Flash, Megan and Central City. What will The Flash do?
