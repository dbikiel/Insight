Dr. Gillespie tries to teach Jimmy Kildare a lesson by tossing him into a street clinic. Only Kildare gets called to take a bullet out of a suspected murderer, and when the cops collar him for it, he has to try and prove his patient's innocence, especially for his sister Rosalie's sake.
Dr. James Kildare has now been at Blair General Hospital for three months and is still working for the crotchety old Dr. Leonard Gillespie. The elderly doctor still has hopes that Kildare has the makings of a diagnostician but thinks he needs some real-world experience. He has him assigned to a street clinic where he will have a great many patients. Gillespie also assigns a pretty nurse, Mary Lamont, to the same clinic to spy on him. Kildare is called out to treat someone who has been shot. It turns out that the victim, Nick Lewett, is wanted by the police for murder, but claims innocence. Kildare believes him and working with Nick's sister Rosalie, sets out to find the real killer.
