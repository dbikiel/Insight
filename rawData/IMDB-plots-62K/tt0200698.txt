The director Jos de Putter films his father during his last year as a farmer.
In 'Het is een schone dag geweest' Jos Putter shows us the last harvest year of his parents on their farm in Zeelandic Flanders. The four seasons are taken in 75 long, modest shots. Characteristic shots of acts, which has been executed on a comparable way for centuries and sometimes gain a ritual dimension; Hands counting the amount of grains per stalk. Hands counting the money after selling the cows. In silence, in the lack of voice-over or any kind of reporting style, in the few spoken dialogues, the characters, the parents, the land and all the traditions come to live.
