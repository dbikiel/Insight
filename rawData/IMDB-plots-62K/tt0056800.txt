During the 1900 Boxer Rebellion, U.S. marine, Maj. Matt Lewis, along with British consul, Sir Arthur Robertson, develop a plan to keep the rebels at bay until an international military relief force can arrive.
Diplomats, soldiers and other representatives of a dozen nations fend off the siege of the International Compound in Peking during the 1900 Boxer Rebellion. The disparate interests unite for survival despite competing factions, overwhelming odds, delayed relief and tacit support of the Boxers by the Empress of China and her generals.
In the early years of the 20th century, Peking (now Beijing) is an open city with the Chinese and several European countries vie for control. The Boxers, who oppose Christianity and the western powers who still exercised complete sovereignty over their compounds and their citizens. The head of the US garrison is Maj. Matt Lewis, an experienced China hand who knows local conditions well. He meets an exiled Russian Baroness, Natalie Ivanoff with whom he falls in love. The political situation is tension-filled with the Boxers having the tacit approval of the Dowager Empress. When the Boxers attack the foreigners, Maj. Lewis, working with the senior officer from the British Embassy, Sir Arthur Robinson, tries to keep them at bay pending the arrival of a relief force.
