Good news for Léon and Bruno, their (unworthy) father has just died! The two brothers, very different from each other, are reunited in some dead loss in the Savoie for the funeral. But at the crematorium, nobody, not even the corpse of their (hated) dad! Well not quite nobody: one girl, a certain Chloe is waiting for them. And there is one more surprise in store for the two brothers: Chloé introduces herself as... their sister!
