Ten years after his son went M.I.A. in Vietnam, U.S. Marine retired Colonel Jason Rhodes assembles a private rescue team to find Americans held in P.O.W. camps in Laos.
A group of Vietnam War veterans re-unite to rescue one of their own left behind and taken prisoner by the Vietnamese. Led by his father (a retired Marine Colonel) and supported by a rich businessman whose son is also a P.O.W., the group engages in a dangerous and violent adventure trying to rescue the P.O.W.s, and at the same time, re-direct their lives.
A Marine Colonel who was dismissed because he wouldn't give up on the notion that his son, who's an M.I.A. in Vietnam is still alive. Nearly ten years after his son went missing, he obtains evidence of where he might be, a P.O.W. camp. So with financial backing from the father of another P.O.W., he recruits some men who served with his son. With photos he obtained, he makes a replica of the camp and they work out a rescue operation. But the government tries to stop them, and when they are about to go, their weapons are confiscated. So they have to find other weapons.
