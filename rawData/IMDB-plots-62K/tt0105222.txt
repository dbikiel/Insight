The film is set in Wales and concerns itself with the aristocracy who are taxing to common people to ruin. Naturally, a certain member of said aristocracy decided that all this is not on, chiefly because most of the money collected by the taxes etc is being spent on keeping Lord Sarn drunk. So Anthony Raine dresses up as a woman, calls himself Rebecca, and leads the common people to victory over their masters.
