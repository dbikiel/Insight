Panoramic view of a resort town in the summer of 1930. In seventeen episodes we get a glimpse at the microcosm of its colourful inhabitants and visitors, Poles and Jews, the high society and the desperately poor.
The social portrait of a summer resort town of Kazimierz Dolny in 1930. Side by side, there are townspeople and summer visitors: Poles, Jews, the intelligentsia, artists, local residents of all classes, and the poor who respect every kind of work which is available. The title refers to the social class stratification: there's one moon for the privileged and the other moon for the poor.
