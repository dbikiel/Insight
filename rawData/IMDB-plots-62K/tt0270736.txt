"Great Hit. Two delinquent clerks are seated in a broker's office engaged in a game of cards. The boss suddenly appears walking through the corridor. The cards are thrown down in great haste and when the employer enters the office the clerks are apparently busily engaged in their work. The boss looks over the mail and then sits down behind an adjacent screen to enjoy the morning paper. A lady suddenly enters the office and upon inquiring for the broker, is shown behind the screen by one of the clerks. He immediately calls the attention of the stenographer and they post themselves upon the chairs and engage in looking over the top of the screen. One of the chairs is suddenly tipped over by the office boy and the clerks and screen fall upon the unsuspecting broker. He immediately becomes wrathful, throws off his coat and proceeds to clear out of the office. One of the clerks becomes frightened and jumps through the window into the corridor; the other is unceremoniously fired through the door. This is an extremely humorous picture."
