A Paris troupe puts on outlandish performances for a celebrated eighteenth-century British actor in order to convince him of their talents; the arrival of a countess complicates the plot.
The Great Garrick (Brian Aherne) is the most celebrated London theater actor of his day (eighteenth century) and is invited to Paris to star at the Comedie Francaise, the most important theatre in France. Before his departure for Paris he is mistakenly quoted as saying that he is 'going to France to teach the French how to act'. The Comedie Francaise actors and director hear about this and take this as a serious insult and thus plot to embarrass The Great Garrick when he gets to France with a great big prank. The Comedie Francaise troupe takes over an inn on Garrick's road to Paris where he spends the night. What the Comedie Francaise actors don't know is that The Great Garrick is in on the joke and just plays along. A wrench is thrown into the plot when lone, lovely countess shows up looking for a room at the inn. Garrick treats her as though she is one of the troupe but she falls in love with him. Edward Everett Horton plays The Great Garrick's valet.
