Francois Merlin is an espionnage-book writer. He likes to mix every-day character he can met in his book. In his book, he is Bob Saint Clar, his neighbour Christine appears as Tatiana and his editor Georges Charon as Colonel Karpoff.
Spy spoof about a Bond like super spy, who with the help of a beautiful woman battles an Albanian villain with a black Persian cat. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that this is the latest work in progress of a struggling author, whose characters are inspired by the people he meets in his mundane life.
