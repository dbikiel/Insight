A documentary around the world looking for young italians who had left the country. From Paris to London, from Bergen to Wien, from Tenerife to NY, six stories of ordinary separation, one question: what happened to Italy?
Emergency Exit is a documentary project about Italy and the consequences of the last 20 years of politics on the young generation: a lot of young Italian leave their country every year, more than 90% of them are graduates and professionally skilled. They move away for a lot of reasons, but nobody in Italy seems to have the desire to listen or care for them. So I decided to start a trip: I traveled around six (and more) European countries, from Paris to London, Berlin, Wien, Bergen and Tenerife, finding young italians who left Italy, looking for better opportunities of life and career.
Anna, Milena, Mauro, Marco, Nicola, Patrizia. They don't know each other, but there's a connection between them: they all left Italy to live and work abroad. Emergency Exit is a documentary trip of immigrant stories. Pushed out of Italy due to high unemployment rate (over 38% of the young population) and very precarious job conditions, in spite of their studies and merits, they chose to move to foreign countries, living in a deep contrast between the desire to seek better opportunities in the global scenario and to retain their homeland's roots and traditions.
Paris, Vienna, and many other cities have become centers of attraction for young Italians who are trying to build or rebuild their professional, personal, and cultural realities. But being an Italian abroad is not a choice without sadness. Far from home, uprooted, to look for a better future -- an emergency exit, in fact -- from a country blocked, mostly by its own doing. We will discover that Italian youth abroad are far from being a lost generation: they work hard, often speak several languages, are trained and often highly skilled. And they still have something to say to their country.
