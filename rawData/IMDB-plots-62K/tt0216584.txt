Tom Green stars as a bumbling buffoon, who lands at Butling after working his way through all other 'A' and 'B' jobs.
Goofy Canadian screwup Bob Tree goes trough the yellow pages alphabetically to pick jobs, applies and messes them up every time. In the B's, he arrived at butler and takes a wacky crash-course with the somewhat odd Mr. Butler. Bob gets hired, but really more as babysitter cum housekeeper for Jacques, his fuzzy lover Anne Jamieson and, most of all, her spoiled-rotten kids Bates and Tess, terrible handfuls which his unorthodox methods may at least take by surprise.
