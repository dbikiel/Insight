After leaving his U.S. Army job in Germany, a trucker takes a long-haul driver job in Britain where he runs into an organized-crime syndicate that controls the trucking industry.
Desperate to earn money, Harry hooks back up with Joe Easy. The best scene is when they make the final run to cash out a load of furs and they get lost on the way through the forest. The three drive the truck over the mountain to connect with the waiting ship in the harbor. The rocky terrain is a tense journey, until they try to cross the steam. Then it gets really good when they get stuck and have to remove a front tire in the middle of the stream. Harry's arm gets caught under the truck fender, they get loose but can't get up the embankment. There's an OK fist fight and then the truck's load slides off and crushes Joe Easy. That gets Harry and Lynn to the waiting ship. Harry then has guilty remorse and returns with Lynn to the wife and hospitalized son. They reconcile and the Police arrest Harry for all his crimes. Lynn heads back to her dead end life at "The Congo Club."
After being discharged from the U.S. Army in Germany, Harry reluctantly follows his wife to England where he lands a job as a truck driver. It is not long before his boss, Joe Easy, tries to involve the ex G.I. in a smuggling operation. Harry first resists but Joe throws Lynn, his own mistress, into his arms and he soon forsakes his scruples. After Lynn has become his lover Harry leaves his wife. When he feels he has made enough money, he considers getting back to the States with Lynn. But just then an accident happens to Butch, his young son...
