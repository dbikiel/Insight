The owner of a strip club decide to create a stripper academy, where anyone can enter and learn to dance like a pro, but only a few will be selected as strippers.
A group of ambitious strippers compete to reach the top of the pole when the owner of a popular strip club attempts to recruit more dancers by opening the first-ever Stripper Academy. A sexy boot camp that teaches inexperienced dancers how to move like the pros, the Stripper Academy holds open enrollment in hopes of recruiting as many beauties as possible. But this is the Ivy League of stripper schools, and students who don't possess the talent to titillate are quickly expelled.
