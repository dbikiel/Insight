Dracula has a great opportunity to try his brand new skills at the neighborhood Halloween party, where he realizes that self-confidence is enough to make him as scary as he ever was.
Sam is a monster movie buff who lives with his grandmother. He has a best friend in the girl next door, but he's always felt like an outsider. One day, when Sam asks his grandmother for a Dracula figurine, she suggests that he write to Santa to ask for one as a Christmas gift. Sam, however, has a better idea - since Halloween is around the corner, he's going to write to Dracula instead!
Dracula is so delighted to receive fan mail in his Transsylvanian castle that he takes it as an invitation for him and faithful servant Mirroe to visit the sender. It's Yankee schoolboy Sam, an orphan who lives with his feisty granny and has a Gothic taste, which combined with his pet tarantula makes him a 'weird' outcast, accepted only by Emma. The letter was a mix-up, but Sam is delighted to meet his favorite horror monster. They bond, and strike a deal: Dracula will teach Sam to shake off his unpopular spooky image, Sam helps him becoming fearful again despite Hollywoodian perversions.
