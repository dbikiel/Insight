Two idential twins, separated since infancy, meet after 30 years causing a series of mistaken identity and crisis for all involved.
Idential twins Philbert and Nathan are too much of a burden on their mother so she separates them by sending Nathan, the "bad seed", to an insane asylum where he grows up with multi personalities while Philbert becomes a well-known senator. On one typical day, Nathan escapes from the asylum to find his long-lost brother and somehow ends up at Philbert's mansion and since they both look alike, they cause some outrageously silly mishaps in which Philbert's long-suffering wife Diane and his mistress/housekeeper Miss Tress are fooled by the deception.
