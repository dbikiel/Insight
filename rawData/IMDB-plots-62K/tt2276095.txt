Rachel, shy little 9 year old, loved by her father and stifled by a possessive mother, meets Valérie, a fearless and shameless girl of her age. With her new friend, she engages to profanity, indecency and nonsense, and opens up to life.
Rachel Gladstein, a shy little nine year old girl, loved by her cynic father and stifled by a possessive Jewish mother, meets at the start of classes Valérie, a fearless and shameless girl of her age. Rachel, influenced by her new girl friend, engages in turn to profanity, indecent gestures and nonsense, and opens up to life. She sleeps with her satchel on her back on the eve of the new school year, and must consult with the psychologist Ms. Trebla who will enter her privacy. In parallel, a friendship develops between the parents of the two girls, particularly between Michael Gladstein and Catherine, the divorced mother of Valérie. The nascent jealousy of Rachel's mother in the face of this closeness will bring her to question her own couple, which suffers from routine and weariness.
Nine year old Rachel (Juliette Gombert) is the only child of the most doting, loving parents ever. Naturally she dreams of getting out from under all this suffocating adoration, even wishing she were an orphan. Her shrink offers no relief from the boredom and discontent. Luckily, she crosses paths with Valerie (Anna Lemarchand), a mischievous scamp with cheek to spare. And when Valerie's single mother meets Rachel's father, Rachel's loving parents are soon on the verge of a lovely mess.
