Living in exile after the death of their father, the grown children of a murdered and usurped king converge to exact eye-for-an-eye revenge.
A powerful rendering of the tragedy of Elektra by Euripides, second in a trilogy. The film begins with a summary treatment without dialogue of the action of the preceding play, The Agamemnon, in which the wicked Queen Clytemnestra and her lover Aesgisthes murder her husband Agamemnon upon his return from the Trojan War.
As Agamemnon bathes upon returning from the Trojan War, his wife and her lover kill him (in revenge for a daughter Agamemnon sacrificed to the gods years earlier). His two surviving children thereafter live in different kinds of exile, with son Orestis immediately taken far away so as to remain unharmed, and daughter Elektra left behind and made a virtual prisoner in the palace. She is latter forced into an undignified marriage to a middle-aged farmer and sent away, which isn't all that bad since the farmer has a generous and caring heart. Still, Electra wants vengeance, and when Orestis finally returns to her, grown up and accompanied by Pylades, plans are made and vengeance is carried out against their mother and her co-murdering lover.
