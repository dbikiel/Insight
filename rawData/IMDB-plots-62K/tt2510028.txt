A former Arizona sheriff's wife is killed while riding on their ranch property. It would appear a Mexican man illegally crossing into the US is at fault. As the former and the current sheriff search for answers, lives are changed forever.
Set in the tumultuous Border town area between Arizona and Mexico, Frontera follows the events that take place after the wife (Amy Madigan) of a former Arizona Sheriff (Ed Harris) is killed while riding on their Ranch property. It would appear a Mexican man (Michael Pena) crossing in to the US illegally is at fault. As the former Sheriff and current Sheriff (Aden Young) search for answers, lives are changed forever and the facts as to who is really at fault in this tragedy are nearly as complicated as the problems between these two neighboring countries.
