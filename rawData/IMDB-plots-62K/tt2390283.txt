A young boy attempts to reunite an abandoned polar bear cub with its mother in northern Canada.
Midnight Sun is both a family film as well as an action/adventure film, taking place in the ice fields of Northern Canada. When Luke discovers that a young polar bear cub has been separated from his mother, he sets out to find a way to reunite the two. Goran Visnjic joins the cast as Muktuk, a half Inuit and half Canadian, who knows the terrain where the polar bears live and who agrees to help the boy. When a floating iceberg divides the party, it is up to Luke to protect himself and the cub from both the dangers of the wild, and the elements to complete his mission.
