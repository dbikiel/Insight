Ging-Keung encounters sinister turns of fate where he works, and he becomes frightened enough to consult with a Taoist priest. The priest informs him that his workplace had been the site of murdering.
A horror movie about ghosts, possession, reincarnation. Ah Kan (Chan Chen) encounters sinister turns of fate where he works (a fellow security guard dies by choking on a bone, another is strangled by a wet newspaper), and he becomes frightened enough to consult with a Taoist priest. The priest informs him that his workplace had been the site of kidnappings and murders, his house is another source of unnatural influence, and he was born on a day that makes him vulnerable to wandering ghosts. These dark forces also threaten his pregnant wife and unborn child, leading Ah Kan on a harrowing journey into the unknown in order to protect himself and his family.
