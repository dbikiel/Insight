Allied prisoners of various nationalities pool their resources to plan numerous escapes from an "escape-proof" German P.O.W. camp housed in a Medieval castle.
Colditz castle was used by the Nazis to hold the "bad boys", (those who regularly tried to escape from other camps). At all times, the guards outnumbered the prisoners and, because some political prisoners were also held there, they were very strictly monitored. But if you put all those people in one place and they're all trying to escape, well, sh-t happens.
