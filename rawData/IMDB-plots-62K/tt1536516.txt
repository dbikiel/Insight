One hundred years ago, an angry mob, intent on justice for their murdered children, hung the woman they believed was the murderer. They branded her a witch, wraped her body in chains and buried it deep in the woods. Flash forward to the present - when Deb and her friends play a childhood game on the witch's wooded grave, they open the door to death. As her friends and family begin to change into something less than human, Deb struggles to stop the witch's curse. But her search for the truth will reveal an evil beyond her imagination.
