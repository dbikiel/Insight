Teresa, a fifty-year-old Austrian mother, travels to the paradise of the beaches of Kenya, seeking out love from African boys. But she must confront the hard truth that on the beaches of Kenya, love is a business.
On the beaches of Kenya they're known as "Sugar Mamas" -- European women who seek out African boys selling love to earn a living. Teresa, a fifty-year-old Austrian and mother of a daughter entering puberty, travels to this vacation paradise. She goes from one beach boy to the next, from one disappointment to the next and finally she must recognize: On the beaches of Kenya, love is a business.
This is a funny and sad black comedy of sorts about overweight, middle-aged European women traveling as a species of sex tourists to Kenya, where they can choose from beautiful, buff young Kenyan men. Shy and naive at first, Teresa can't believe so many handsome young men would want her. But what do they REALLY want? This becomes increasingly and painfully obvious as she tries out a few different suitors. In the end, we are left to wonder -- who is exploiting whom? Very unusual and thought-provoking on many levels, with surprising laughs and teeth-gritting moments.
Fat chicks need love too.
