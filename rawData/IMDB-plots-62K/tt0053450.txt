On a farm in the Canadian North-West, a young widow becomes the source of a jealous rivalry between her little son and her new husband.
After her husband dies in a fire, a woman is left to tend for her young son and the family farm on her own. Soon, she takes in a drifting handyman, they fall in love, and a resentment begins to build between the son and his new "step-father" who treats the boy harshly on purpose.
