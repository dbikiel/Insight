Starting with a small flock of carrier pigeons, nineteenth-century entrepreneur Julius Reuter turns his small company into Europe's most respected news wire service.
Somewhat fictionalized account of Julius Reuter who founded the worldwide news agency that still bears his name. His fist service involved the use of carrier pigeons to carry information between Aachen and Brussels. That came to an end when telegraph lines were finally built between the two cities. He relocates to London and decides there may a future for a news service, something that did not exist at the time. His delivery of Emperor Napoleon III's speech in record time establishes the agency. He faces stiff competition however and continually tries to find ways to be the first to report the news. When he is the first to report Lincoln's assassination, his reputation is called into question.
