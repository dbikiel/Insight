Vinni-Pukh is trying to help his friend donkey with huge depression which happened to be on his birthday
An old gray donkey Ia is standing on the shore of the lake and feels sad. Winnie the Pooh comes to him, to whom Ia admits that he has a birthday today, which no one remembered, besides, the donkey somewhere has lost its tail. Later, Winnie the Pooh meets with Piglet, and they decide to congratulate Ia: Winnie the Pooh will give him a pot of honey, and Piglet - a balloon. However, on the way Pooh ate honey and came to the donkey with an empty pot, and Piglet, wishing to give Ia a gift first, hurried so much that he fell and, as a result, became very upset and brought the burst ball to the donkey.
