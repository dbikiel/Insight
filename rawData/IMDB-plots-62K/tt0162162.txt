The story follows the sporadic reunions of six friends during the seven year period of their integration into society. The reunions take place on their ancestral island, the setting of their common past. Every time they return "home" they carry with them the results of their personal choices. They also carry with them the effects of modern Greek society, a society the slowly but surely changes them, weathering their relationships, until they gradually lose contact with each other. The end of this epoch, will find them dispersed, confronting the dawn of an era where the pursuit of individual ambitions reigns.
The film follows the sporadic get-togethers of six people in the course of a seven year period beginning with the summer of 1987 (Eurobasket) and ending with the summer of 1994 (Mundial). It seeks to depict the gradual loss of any possibility of communication among these six individuals who were once close friends (during their school years). As their lives follow paths that take them far from their island birthplace, their return visits bring them forcibly face to face with the past. These homecomings resemble an unconscious search for a point of departure. And a close scrutiny of the course each one of them has taken in the light of their initial intentions is unavoidable. So the differentiations, the divergences, the changes emerge in sharp relief as does the intention of each one of them to recognize them or not. As time goes by they drift continually further apart. The things they share become fewer. The farther they move Ã¡way from their starting-point, the greater the distance between them grows. Until the point when contact becomes impossible. The final break is unavoidable although it will take an event that serves as a catalyst to make them realise it and it is only then that the longing for what is irretrievably lost will prove romantic wishful thinking.
