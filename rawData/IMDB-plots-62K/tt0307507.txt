It's a quiet little town where nothing happens - until the day the bank is hit for half a million dollars of Indian casino money by a thief wearing a clowns mask. From here the story follows a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse between bank robber and former cop Parker (James Spader) and small-town police officer Ray DeCarlo (David Keith) determined to catch him. Parker doesn't help himself by holing up with a nurse who happens to be DeCarlo's former wife. Throw in a rookie FBI agent, Indians who want their money back, some former friends of Parker who are not so friendly anymore and his fate seems sealed.
