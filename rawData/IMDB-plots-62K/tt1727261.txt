A murderer, a priest, and a delinquent try to bring down a father-killing madman.
Ahab, a man obsessed with exacting a brutal, violent revenge on the man who murdered his dad, joins John, an eager priest, and Twink, a hot-headed street hustler, on an epic quest to find and defeat this mythical monster known as Chris Fuchman AKA The Father's Day Killer.
A sadist named Chris Fuchman has been raping and killing fathers for years. Ahab was a boy when Fuchman murdered his dad. He tries to take revenge, but he kills the wrong guy and is sent to prison. After Ahab gets out, he is brought back to society by a priest, Father John Sullivan. Twink, a young delinquent, has recently witnessed his father being killed. The three of them team up to hunt Fuchman, getting into some crazy situations as the murders continue.
