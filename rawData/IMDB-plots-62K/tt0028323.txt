A black man sneaks out of church and tries to steal a chicken, but gets a taste of hell when he's accidentally knocked unconscious.
It is Sunday and black families are getting ready for church. There are mammies who put shoeshine on their son's heads, and pappies who polish their head to be all shiny and new. On the way to church, a lady who has twin sons uses a brassier as a baby bonnet for them. Then a lady who is ready to go finds that her husband Nicodemus is busy shootin' craps. She pulls him by the ear and heads for church, but Nicodemus sneaks out and finds a chicken-yard. He chases a chicken and gets hit on the head by a fence. He finds himself in the devil's court.
