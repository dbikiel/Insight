A woman is preparing a romantic dinner for two for her and her husband to celebrate their wedding anniversary. Her husband is out running a series of errands, most of his stops to pick up anniversary gifts for his wife. But the anti-anniversary Gods seem to be working against him as Paris traffic and other problems at each stop seem to be holding him up from getting in and out and to home on time for dinner. Meanwhile, his wife has no idea what has happened to her husband. Will it still be a happy anniversary by the time he makes it home?
