A heart-broken teacher chaperones a group of high schoolers to a state drama competition.
When Miss Stevens chaperones three of her students - Billy, Margot and Sam - on a weekend trip to a drama competition, she discovers that coming of age stories aren't just for teenagers. Exploring the fine line between being a grown up and being a kid, MISS STEVENS looks at the moment you realize maybe you're the responsible adult in the room, and what comes after you find out you're not who you thought you'd be.
