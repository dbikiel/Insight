A man tries to get a good night's sleep, but is disturbed by a giant spider that leaps onto his bed, and a battle ensues in hilarious comic fashion.
After a hard day's work, an exhausted man can't wait to retire, and without delay, he lies in his soft and warm bed. However, much to his surprise, an enormous eight-legged adversary in the form of a frightful hairy spider crawls up on the foot of his bed, thwarting the man's plans for a good sleep. Suddenly, the broom next to him becomes the weapon of choice, but it seems that the persistent foe has already won. Who could sleep after such a fierce battle?
A bearded man, played by the director, blows out the candle by his nightstand and lays down for a good night's sleep. Just as he is dozing off, a huge bedbug/cockroach begins to clamber up his sheets, awakening him and causing the bug to fall to the floor. Now it begins to climb the wall, whilst the unfortunate man grabs a broom and engages the enormous insect in a fight. Finally, he disposes of it in a chamber pot which he places in the nightstand, and lays down for sleep once more; but the bugs having inhabited his berth, the man must now attack an entire army of these critters for possession of the bed.
