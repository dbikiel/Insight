After witnessing a murder, a young boy named Devon refuses to testify unless he is given the chance to be a policeman.
Devon Butler is an eight-year old who dreams of being a cop. He watches police TV shows, knows police procedures, and plays cops and robbers with his friend Ray. One day, while snooping around in a warehouse, he witnesses a murder. He goes to the police, who want the information, but won't get it until they make Devon a cop. The police then team him with veteran cop (and child hater) Nick McKenna, and the two team up in comic series of events to find the killer.
Nick McKeena is a tough, fearless, solitary and resentful Florida's cop. After an operation to apprehend drugs, his partner dies during a shooting, and McKeena takes the responsibility of the tragedy. Devon Butler is a little kid who is obsessed for cop-movies, and dreams of becoming a policeman, living the most dangerous adventures. After testifying on a murder practiced by an Italian crime boss, Devon decides to help the police arrest the criminal, with one condition - he is to be a cop for a few days, and solitary Nick ends up being chosen as Devon's partner. Together, the two will have great adventures and they will be hunted by the mafioso, at the same time in that a paternal relationship will be born between both.
When a pint-sized 8-year-old kid witnesses a murder he offers to help the police, if they make him a cop, too. Saddled with this streetwise sidekick, a hardboiled cop is forced to take his new partner seriously as they race the clock to bring the bad guys to justice.
