A young boy in the woods discovers a lovable alien...or is it?
One of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 faves. A little boy who has an extensive array of pets he likes to call "specimens" finds an alien egg to hatch, somewhat like Horton. The creature manages to use his snout to suck up peanuts and warp time and space with his fingers. Unfortunately, his brother who is found by poachers go on a killing spree.
