After a doctor commits suicide when his research into human embryos is terminated, his wife seduces and then executes revenge upon those she holds responsible.
A young doctor kills himself after a medical committee terminates his research into human embryos, considering it too inhumane. His wife then seeks revenge on those who drove her husband to his death by luring each member of the committee into compromising situations and then killing them one by one.
Dr. Johnson is happily married with his beloved wife Mrs. Johnson and is researching human embryos using animal cells. When he brings his findings to the Board of the prominent Dr. Franklin Houston, Prof. Jonathan Walker, Dr. Crawford and Dr. Donen, the committee rejects his researches and destroys his laboratory. Dr. Johnson has a nervous breakdown and commits suicide, and the disturbed Mrs. Johnson seeks revenge, seducing each member of the Board and killing one by one while having sex with his victims.
