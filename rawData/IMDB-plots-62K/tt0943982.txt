The 'has-been' Hollywood Western actors, Mel Torres and Fred Fletcher, hear Fritz Frobisher will attend a screening of one of his movies in Arizona. They decide to go exact revenge on him for terrorizing them and other kids with a whip on their first set. To this end Mel's unenthusiastic daughter, Delilah, is persuaded to provide her decent car, and comes along all the way from L.A. Endless discussions about movies, simple philosophy and morality are interlaced with accidental and purely scare-induced horror. When they arrive, neither the screening nor Frobisher are anything like they imagined.
