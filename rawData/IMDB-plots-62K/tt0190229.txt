Filmed two years before Predator, many have commented that Alien Outlaw could have been that film's inspiration -- An alien ship lands in a remote mountain location and its occupants go on a hunting party. And, yes, their prey is human! This science fiction adventure has been praised for its subtle social commentary and humankind's relationship with guns, friends and nature. Fashioned like an old comic book story, ALIEN OUTLAW is the second film that B-Western film star Lash La Rue did for Writer/Director Phil Smoot. Always starring in cowboy flicks that featured him with a whip, La Rue said, "They just won't let me put that thing down!" But in his last leading role, Lash La Rue breaks the mold in a film that features both guns and horses but allows him to put down his trademark weapon. Perhaps, as a result, this has been called La Rue's finest film performance.
