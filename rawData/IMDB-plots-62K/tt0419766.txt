This coming-of-age drama deals with a young man, realizing who he really is and which things he will never do. Loic, 18 years old, being annoyed by his work in a chocolate factory, cruises in the internet by night to have sex with older men. His life is turned upside down by a row of events such as his friendship to a man who is not just interested in his body and the suicide of his best friend...
Sex, love and obsession are thrown sharply into focus in this darkly sinister film. The so-called stupid boy of the title, Loic is a confused yet sexually liberated young man who divides his time between working in a factory and engaging in random, often paid, sexual encounters with an assortment of men he meets on the internet. However, a developing obsession with his best friend Marie, a non-sexual relationship with the enigmatic Lionel and a lust for a famous footballer whose star is falling, all conspire to drive Loic to the very edge of sanity.
