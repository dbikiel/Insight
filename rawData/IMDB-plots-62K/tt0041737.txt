Residents of a part of London declare independence when they discover an old treaty. This leads to the need for a "Passport to Pimlico".
When an unexploded World War II bomb is accidentally detonated in Pimlico, London, England, it reveals a treasure trove. They find documents proving that the region is, in fact, part of Burgundy, France, and thus foreign territory. The British government attempts to regain control by setting up border controls and cutting off services to the area. The "Burgundians" fight back.
