A high school hockey player forced to lead his sister's Girl Guide troop.
A likeable but full-of-himself high school hockey star winds up being the new den mother of his little sister's troupe of Bumble Bees. Though he soon starts using the girls as slave labor for personal gain, the experience eventually brings him out of himself when he sees how his selfish actions have hurt others and that his charm can't always get him through these situations, excuse his behavior, or repair the damage.
