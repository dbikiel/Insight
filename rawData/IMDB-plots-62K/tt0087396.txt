Chilling story of a farmhand who realizes his popular boss has been committing incest with his daughter for years.
Robert, a wealthy sheep farmer, uses power and domination to rule both his farm and his family. He covets three things in his possession; his stags, his guns and his daughter, Cathy. Itinerant shepherd, Peter, accepting employment on the farm, finds himself drawn into a sinister, domestic dilemma. What he doesn't know is that she is being sexually abused by her father and is powerless to escape. Torn with the confusion of guilt and fear, she remains in this destructive situation to nurse her paralyzed mother, the victim of a stroke. Peter's sensitivity and tenderness towards her poses an alternative to her father's brutish behavior. However, Robert does not appreciate Peter's interest in his daughter and sends the shepherd to a distant hut to muster sheep. The tension builds when she visits Peter's hut against her father's wishes. Robert, feeling threatened, orders the shepherd off his farm. She reveals her grim secret to Peter and when they attempt to escape, the ensuing hunt ends in a violent climax.
