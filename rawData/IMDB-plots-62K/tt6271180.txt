In 1947 those aspiring to be priest, are sent to a remote convent to live in seclusion (Seklusyon) on the last day of their training. The purpose is to shield them from evil of the world. The plot thickens when a mysterious young girl comes to the convent but the question is whether she is really sent by God or by the Evil. This is the challenge awaits the candidates.
They say that the devil attacks more aggressively during the last seven days of becoming a priest, so deacons are sent to a secluded holy fortress to avoid the devil's temptations, not until a mysterious young girl arrives and twists the fates of the aspiring servants of the church. Will faith be stronger than any fear?
In 1947, a group of deacons (aspiring priests) on their last week of training are sent to a remote convent to live in seclusion for seven days, to protect them from the devil, who, on the last few days of training, attempts to break the will of deacons to make them reconsider their choice of becoming priests. In the midst of their seclusion, a little girl named Anghela, believed by locals to be a living saint because of her healing abilities, is sent to the convent, seeking refuge. But as time goes on, whether Anghela is an angel or an agent of the devil becomes more and more unclear.
