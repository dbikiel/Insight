After losing his mother, a young boy is sent to a foster home with other orphans his age where he begins to learn the meaning of trust and true love.
Courgette (Zucchini) is an intriguing nickname for a 9-year-old boy. Although his unique story is surprisingly universal. After his mother's disappearance, Courgette is befriended by a police officer Raymond, who accompanies him to his new foster home filled with other orphans his age. At first he struggles to find his place in this strange, at times, hostile environment. Yet with Raymond's help and his new-found friends, Courgette eventually learns to trust and might find true love.
Nicknamed Courgette by his alcoholic and neglectful mother, the 9-year-old Icare is suddenly left all alone in the world after the unforeseen and tragic disappearance of his only parent. With his funny nickname as his only souvenir from his mother and a faded memory of his long-lost dad, the timid boy will befriend the caring police officer and father-figure, Raymond, on his way to the orphanage. There, amid equally traumatised kids, Courgette will have to struggle to fit in; however, even though every new beginning is difficult, maybe this time, good things await for a change.
