XXX chair-on-chair action.
On a high and wind-swept rooftop, a young couple in love enjoys life, mating vigorously and, of course, loudly. He is a stalwart gentleman ready to offer his succulent mate the world, while on the other hand, the beauteous and buxom dame has already surrendered to his charms, lost in his eyes. Their passion is infinite and ardent; their chafed knees and elbows prove it.
Did Lord Chesterfield and Queen Anne carry on like this? It's the classic apartment-house roof top: flat, with a low wall around it, wires and pipes everywhere, and a door to a stairwell. As the door flies open, the laughter of a man and woman at play accompanies the appearance of two stop-animated chairs - he chasing her. They mate, enthusiastically, across the roof top, changing positions, her elbows chaffing against the brick and rough edges. Later that day, their owner enters the flat and sees stuffing sticking out from tears in the upholstery of the "female" chair. Someone has to pay.
