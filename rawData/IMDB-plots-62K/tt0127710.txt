In seductive central Paris, an undernourished gendarme willing to go to great lengths to feed himself hatches a desperate, yet utterly cunning plan.
In seductive central Paris, amidst American noisy tourists, an undernourished gendarme unexpectedly stumbles across a sweet elderly woman feeding flocks of pigeons in the park with out-of-the-ordinary table scraps. As a result, it won't take long before the emaciated and starving officer hatches a desperate, yet utterly cunning plan to trick the merciful unsuspecting lady into letting him take part in the feasts, willing to go to great lengths to get himself fed. But where does the need for survival end, and where does greed begin? As the lucky police officer gets fatter by the day, soon, he will realise that moderation is golden.
While American popcorn-eating tourists wobble around Paris and pigeons are too fat to fly, a starving French gendarme is desperate for food. Watching the birds feast on cakes and crumbs brought by an old lady, he slowly realizes that his best chance of survival is to dress up like a pigeon and try to trick the old lady into feeding him as well. The old lady doesn't seem to suspect anything and serves the oversized man-bird all kinds of food in her home, and while he slowly gets fatter and fatter, the line between man and bird is getting blurry. And when he at last finds out what he has gotten himself into, it's far too late to turn back...
