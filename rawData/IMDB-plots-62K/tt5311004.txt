Friday night is almost like a shortened New year's night. One can expect every kind of surprises on that night. Friday night has its special magic.
What if a gambling millionaire becomes a waiter for one night, an office loser will be the star of the brightest party, and two "sworn" friends will have to look for a kangaroo at night in a forest near Moscow? Everyone has their own Friday. How does it end for everyone, only Saturday morning knows.
