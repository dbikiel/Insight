Unemployed man forgets his dignity to support his family.
A former stone worker in search of employment takes a most unanticipated career: Juha is out of a job, but he's trying to keep his unemployed status a secret from his clinically depressed wife Katja. Having failed to earn a paycheck for two months, he begins posting flyers around town in search of odd jobs. In order to ensure that his wife won't find out he lists his best friend Olli's telephone number on the flyers. It's not long before a woman calls seeking a man's help with some structural work, and eager Juha jumps at the chance to earn some extra cash. At the woman's home, however, things quickly take a strange turn as the woman asks him to strip naked and brush her hair. Later, after returning to the woman's house for a more intimate session, the quick-thinking entrepreneur hires Olli as his contact man and launches a profitable escort business catering to lonely, middle-aged women. When his wife telephones his former employer and discovers he was laid off and his daughter subsequently makes a surprising find in dad's briefcase, he is finally forced to tell the truth about his new occupation.
Juha is 38 years old and has three small children and a depressed wife. He sees himself as strong and believes a man should provide for his family. But one day Juha is fired from his job. Ashamed, he weaves a web of lies to hide the fact from his family. With the help of his friend Olli, Juha begins prostituting himself to support his wife and children. With this he makes in two hours what it took him two days to earn before. The shame and deception mushroom, but the pay from the new profession seems to offset the downside.
