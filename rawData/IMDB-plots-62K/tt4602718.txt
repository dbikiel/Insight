Follows Max Kenner, an ambitious suburbanite with big dreams of becoming a real life action hero and working for the C.I.A. When Max flies off to a big college, he learns lessons in love, friendship, and foils danger.
"Enduring Destiny" is the fascinating story of "Max Kenner" (Thomas Reilly-King) who is a scholarship wrestler and aspiring C.I.A. agent. He has traveled from his suburban California home and high school sweetheart, "Jessica Bateman" (Ariel Vida) to a bitter cold semester at Michigan State University. There unfolds a gripping, coming-of-age journey into the glory days of youth and timeless memories. Personalities intermingle in a mix of triumphs, romance, comedy, mishaps, and downright misery. Once a squeaky clean, slightly cocky guy of privilege and self determination, he is thrust into a humbling life of physical dependence after tragedy strikes. As a cripple in a wheelchair, Max's masculinity becomes challenged by his reliance on others. Jealousy and ulterior motives surface through a landscape filled with fast-paced fraternity parties and superficiality galore. Also starring: Shae Valko as nerdy roommate, "Bernard Feinstein"; Nick Zott as Max's fraternity big brother, "Jake Conway"; and Zack Stewart as the wrestling team bully, "Sid Butcher." There is also Russ "Rusty" Jameson and the one and only Mr. Bill Vincent ("Army of Darkness," "The Evil Dead"). "Enduring Destiny" is a deconstruction into a status-driven ego of crippling proportions. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll witness one young man's fire burning deep inside!
