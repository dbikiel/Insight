An Iranian family survives the shah and the ayatollah and moves to France. This story follows the family through it all. Despite the politics, revolution, prison, beatings, assassinations and suicides this is a comedy.
Hibat Tabib and his wife Feresteh live in a small village in the South of Iran. They are young, full of life, idealistic and militate actively for democracy. They are not afraid to rise against two successive despots, the Shah first, and later on the Ayatollah Khomeini. In 1984, they are forced to flee their country with their son. After a long, difficult and dangerous journey they end up reaching France. They settle down in the ÃŽle-de-France region where, after a period of adjustment, they manage to integrate into the French social fabric, particularly by getting involved in the local community.
