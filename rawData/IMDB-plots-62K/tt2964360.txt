The only thing standing between Dr. Lisa Leland (Candace Cameron Bure) and her dream wedding in the Hamptons is a 2600-mile drive from Los Angeles to Long Island. But a run-in with the law in the country town of Normal, North Carolina leaves Lisa with a choice: jail or community service. Sentenced to three days as the town's doctor, Lisa soon finds her world turned upside-down by a man and discovers a lot more to Normal.
