The Groundhog tells the story of how, for once, Jack Frost became human, and helped a knight win his lady love.
Jack Frost ushers in winter every year, but he is upset that he is unable to interact with humans, since they cannot see him. When he falls in love with the young peasant woman Elisa, he requests to be made human and his superior, Father Winter, who agrees to make him permanently human as long as he has a house, horse, bag of gold, and a wife by the beginning of spring. When Jack arrives in town and is introduced to Elisa and her family, he learns they are oppressed by a greedy Cossack, who has eyes on the peasants' income and Elisa. And Jack must also contend with Elisa's childhood sweetheart, Sir Ravenal. Will he decide to remain human in the end?
