This send-up of ragtime song and dance begins in 1915 San Francisco when society boy Roger Grant decides to pursue popular rather than serious music.
Roger Grant, a classical violinist, disappoints his family and teacher when he organizes a jazz band, but he and the band become successful. Roger falls in love with his singer Stella, but his reluctance to lose her leads him to thwart her efforts to become a solo star. When the World War separates them in 1917, Stella marries Roger's best friend Charlie. Roger comes home after the war and an important concert at Carnegie Hall brings the corners of the romantic triangle together.
In 1910s San Francisco, concert violinist Roger Grant, also known as Alexander, abandons classical music to join a ragtime band with pianist Charlie Dwyer and singer Stella Kirby. Alexander's switch dismays his high society family. As two decades pass and popular music transitions from ragtime to jazz, the ragtime band trio grows both stronger and weaker through love, breakups and war -- all along the rising and falling tide of their musical success.
