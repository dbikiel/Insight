German terrorists kidnap the crew of an aeroplane as they leave the airport. The terrorists demand the release of two of their colleagues, who are to be extradited to the USA. The father of one of the stewardesses decides he can no longer wait for diplomacy, and so flies out to Germany. There, frustration leads him to hire a former SAS counter-terrorism expert. Together they hunt down the terrorists.
