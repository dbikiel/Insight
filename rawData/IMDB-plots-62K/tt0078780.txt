The animal kingdom stages its own olympic games.
Animalympics is all about the Animal Olympics Contest where all the animals around the world gather to take part in everything from skiing in North America to the very long marathon race in humid conditions. With lively music provided by Graham Gouldman, the film is very different to other cartoons, being more of a drama-comedy than cartoon. With a turtle hosting the proceedings and a killer whale competing against a sting ray in the swimming competition.
