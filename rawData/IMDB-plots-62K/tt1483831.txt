During the First Lebanon War in 1982, a lone tank and a paratroopers platoon are dispatched to search a hostile town.
June, 1982 - The First Lebanon War. A lone tank and a infantry platoon are dispatched to search a hostile town - a simple mission that turns into a nightmare. The four members of a tank crew find themselves in a violent situation that they cannot handle. Motivated by fear and the basic instinct of survival, they desperately try not to lose themselves in the most emblematic act of uncivilized problem solving: war.
Four civilians dressed up as soldiers find themselves in a dilemma about to stay humans or to die. They try to share the responsibility and act as fighting soldiers as less as possible but they immediately must face the terrible consequences of not taking actions. To kill or to be killed, follow other's orders or your moral rules? If the hesitate too much maybe it'll be too late.
