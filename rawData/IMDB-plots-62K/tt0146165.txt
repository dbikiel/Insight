The public and private lives of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. and Peter Lawford.
In the 1950s and 1960s Frank Sinatra was the head of the infamous "Rat Pack". He, Sammy Davis Jr., Dean Martin, Peter Lawford and Joey Bishop worked and played together. This film dramatizes their volatile relationships with each other and the Kennedys, Marilyn Monroe, mobster Sam Giancana, Judith Campbell Exner and the FBI. Sinatra helps John F. Kennedy get elected in 1960 with a little help from Giancana. Lawford, married to a Kennedy, is an unhappy go-between. Davis is fighting racism and insecurity. Campbell is sleeping with both Giancana and JFK who is also sleeping with Monroe.
Controversial account of the exploits of the Rat Pack (Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford, and Joey Bishop). The film focuses on their ties to organized crime, to the Kennedy clan, and on their often turbulent personal lives.
Biopic of Frank Sinatra and several of his cronies - dubbed the Rat Pack - during 1960-61. It was the beginning of change in America. Sinatra decides to support John F. Kennedy for President and sets about lining up the support of his friends. He is upset however when Joe Kennedy leans on him to use his purported mob connections to make sure his son wins first the nomination and then the election. Friend Sammy Davis Jr. falls in love with May Britt but again, pressure is put on Frank not to participate in the wedding as it may alienate southern voters. While Frank is asked to organize the inaugural ball, he again has to exclude Sammy for the same reason. The final blow is when the newly elected President visits Los Angeles and decides to stay with Bing Crosby - a Republican - rather that at his house.
