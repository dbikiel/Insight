In a small mining community in Northern Sweden, a group of youngsters about to take the leap in the adult age fight with themselves and the world around, while the ground literally trembles under their feet.
North of the Arctic circle, on the ancestral lands of the indigenous sami people: Kiruna, a small community built around an iron ore mine - a mine that is its throbbing heart and main economic activity, feeding but also gradually destroying the ground. Here, a group of youngsters are about to take the leap in the adult age, while the ground literally trembles under their feet. From the winter cold to summer greenery, they will fight with themselves and the world around them, learning to live, love and dream - while the city also is in a time of change, forced to move elsewhere due to the explosions mining the ground.
