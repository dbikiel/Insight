Pierre Gilieth has committed a murder in Paris. He flees to Barcelona, where he runs out of money. So he joins the Spanish Foreign Legion. He meets there two fellow countrymen, Mulot and Lucas. He tries to forget his fault... but Lucas's friendship soon appears to be less unselfish...
Pierre Gilieth has murdered a man in France, and escapes to join the Spanish Foreign Legion. One of the soldiers he meets and becomes friends with is Fernando Lucas who is really a member of the secret police whose goal is to trap Gilieth into admitting his guilt. Gilieth also falls in love with and marries Aischa la Slaoui, an Arabian dancing girl. Gilieth and Lucas, now mortal enemies, are the last two survivors of a desert outpost under siege by Riff soldiers. The troop commandant, before he dies, makes Lucas realize that Gileith has more than expiated his crime back in France by his heroism under fire.
