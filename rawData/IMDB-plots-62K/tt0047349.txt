While pursing new companions, a former married couple keep running into one another all over town.
After eight years of marriage, Robert and Nina divorce. He takes up with his womanising Navy buddy Charlie Nelson while she looks to her interfering mother for guidance. Both start dating other people, but although they try and ignore each other whenever they accidentally meet, it is obvious the past is not dead. Then one night they find themselves in a nightclub doing the mambo together.
After months of each feeling but not stating outwardly to the other that they have been dissatisfied with their marriage, lawyer Robert Tracey and soap opera creator and writer Nina Tracey n√©e Chapman, after eight years of marriage, decide to get an uncontested divorce. They are at the stage of hating the other so much that despite the divorce being uncontested on both sides, each is irked that the break-up isn't causing the other any grief. Each also feels that the downfall of their marriage is in large part due to the advice and support of their primary confidantes, Robert's being his womanizing best friend, plagiarizing playwright and old army buddy Charlie Nelson, and Nina's being her mother, interior designer Edith Chapman who is further advised by who Robert considers Edith's quack of a therapist, Dr. Van Kessel. During the post-divorce period, Robert and Nina can't seem to help but constantly run into each other. Their individual lives also seem somewhat to parallel each other, including the satisfaction of their respective dates with others, which are encouraged by Charlie and Edith. That parallel also includes an eventual realization about their true feeling for the other. The question becomes if their pre-divorce behavior of not stating what they're feeling will kibosh what each really wants in life.
