A young doctor undergoes a spiritual crisis when he returns to his rural home.
Ámbrus is a young and successful doctor. A friend who attended the same medical school but left the profession requests an old professor to conduct an operation of her wife/girlfriend - and while she survives the operation after a resurrection, the prof himself dies because of the distress. Ámbrus gets confused and - since he cannot find his soul's peace in the city where he works (Budapest) he decides to take some days off and to return to his homeland, a small village in the Great Plain. Indeed, there he finds more trouble than relief, so finally he returns to Budapest. It is raining as he returns, and he is listening to Bela Bartok's Cantata Profana ( a symbolic tale about hunters turning themselves into deers irrevocably) helping a hitch-hiker soldier who wants to be a mechanic after his duty to take his train.
