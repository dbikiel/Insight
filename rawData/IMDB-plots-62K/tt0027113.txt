After the events in Them Thar Hills (1934), Stan and Ollie encounter their old nemesis whose grocery shop is next to their home appliances store. Unable to let bygones be bygones, a war breaks out. Will those tit-for-tat battles ever end?
Stan &amp; Ollie have set up their own electrical repair store. Unfortunately, for them, the grocery store opposite is run by the man &amp; wife they encountered with in Them Thar Hills (1935). Stan &amp; Ollie go and visit, to offer the hand of friendship, but the grocer soon becomes convinced that Ollie is trying to seduce his wife. The grocer takes his revenge first upon Stan &amp; Ollie and then upon the goods in their shop, with the duo carrying out similar attacks on the grocer and his property.
After the fateful events in Them Thar Hills (1934), once more, Stan and Ollie stumble upon their old nemesis, Mr Hall--the owner of the grocery shop right next to the boys' brand-new electrical appliances store. Under those circumstances and unable to let bygones be bygones, the irate husband starts a war, as unfounded suspicions of a clandestine romantic affair pave the way for a seemingly endless string of escalating retaliations. Will those tit-for-tat battles ever end?
