Four misfit campers must band together and conquer their fears in order to save the world during an alien invasion.
Summer camp at Rim of the World has barely begun when four misfit teenagers -- Alex, ZhenZhen, Dariush, and Gabriel -- find they've got bigger problems to face than learning how to canoe and climb ropes when aliens suddenly invade the planet. Alone in a campground once teeming with people, the kids are unexpectedly entrusted with a key that carries the secret to stopping the invasion. Without any adults or electronics to help guide the way, it's clear what they must do: band together, conquer their fears, and save the world.
