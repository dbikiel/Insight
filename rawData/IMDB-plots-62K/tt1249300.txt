Step brothers Drake and Josh must give a foster family the best Christmas ever or face years in jail for a Christmas party gone wrong.
While trying to avoid an obsessed girl, rocker Drake Parker meets a young girl, who makes him promise to give her family the best Christmas ever. Later, at the Premiere's first ever Christmas party, a group of teens start to make trouble. Concerned, Josh, Drake's stepbrother, calls the cops about a disturbance, but they are confused and think the entire party is the disturbance, and even arrest the kind Josh. Requiring Josh's help to keep his promise, Drake tries to break his brother out of prison, but is caught. At court, the judge decides that the two must give the girl and her foster family the best Christmas ever, or face years in jail. They face many problems along the way, including Officer Perry, a strict detective that hates Christmas; a colorful group of foster children; and a wild wood chipper. It is up to Drake and Josh to save Christmas for the good-hearted children, or face the consequences.
Drake and Josh get jobs at the mall, one as Santa Claus and the other as his assistant. While working, they meet a less-fortunate girl and makes her a promise that this will be the best Christmas ever.
