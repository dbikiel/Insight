Taiwanese triad leader Chung Chan (Jeffrey Lau) demands that the Saint of Gamblers, Chow Sing Cho (Stephen Chow), play cards for him at an upcoming gambling tournament - at the stake of his Uncle Blackie Tat's (Man Tat Ng) life. However, because Sing is away traveling around the world, Tat hopes that Sing's sister Mei (Anita Mui) would enter the tournament, as she has magical powers like her brother. Unfortunately, she refuses to gamble and is looking to apprehend Sing herself for abusing his powers in gambling. As a result, this leaves Tat to seek out the dicey Queen Of Gamblers (Carol 'Do Do' Cheng) to play for him instead.
