Prequel to Kuzya's story tells about his adventures in the woods, and how he got into Natasha's apartment.
The story begins in one fairy forest. Baba-Yaga, losing control of her Izbushka on chicken legs, on the advice of the old Leshy decides to get a brownie: "to keep the house in his hands!". For this, she kidnaps a boy in the village called Kuzya. The newly acquired "grandson" really quickly pushed up Izbushka and brought the economy in order. Soon, Baba-Yaga starts courting not only his Izbushka, but also for Kuzya himself. But the dweller still wants to return home to his mentor Nafanya.
