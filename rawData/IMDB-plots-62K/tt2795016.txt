Automated porridge production system provides the city with food for 3 years.
One good girl got a magic pot. On the command "Pot, wag!" it began to cook a delicious cereal. On the command "A pot, do not cook!" - stopped. The girl decided to convoke the guests and properly feed them. She shared a secret with the local producer of sausages and meat products named Karl Hagenbak. He tricked the potty with cunning, but he recognized only the first spell from the girl. Karl began to cook and sell porridge, but how to get the pot to stop doing it had no idea.
