An expedition seeking to bring Jane back to civilization, and Tarzan into captivity, gets more than it's bargained for.
Jane's cousins Rita and Eric Parker arrive in Africa searching for her. Their uncle has died and has left her half a million pounds provided she agrees to return to civilization. A professional hunter, Captain Fry, quickly agrees to escort them to the escarpment where rumor has it there there lives a great white ape. He's intrigued when told that the great white ape is likely Tarzan and his plan is to capture him and put him on display. When they all find each other, Jane agrees to return to London if only to ensure that her cousins get their late uncle's wealth. Fry manipulates Tarzan into believing that Jane will never return only to trap him. When Jane and the others are taken prisoner by warring tribesmen, it's left to Tarzan to rescue them.
Intent on bringing Jane back to civilisation to settle the urgent matter of a lucrative inheritance, British cousins, Eric and Rita, enlist the help of the seasoned local hunter, Captain John Fry, to lead them to her home in the jungle. However--under the pretence of joining a wild African safari--Fry's ulterior motive is much more sinister, as he wishes to capture the area's elusive "White Ape", rumoured to dwell somewhere in the sacred Mutia escarpment. The expedition's treacherous leader will stop at nothing to see his rarest specimen, Tarzan, inside a sturdy duraluminum cage; nevertheless, will he get away with deception?
