Mathuyas is instructed to team up with simpleton Teutonic giant Olaf. Ramusan can't pay them the promised gold, but offers the hand of his daughter Silda, whose portrait shows a priceless medallion. Their fight is complicated by the mysterious Cobra, hired by Talus, who captured the princess, so they pair pretends to enter Talus's service, but finds out about an even more devious deception, while Talus captures the book and thus is able to conjure the warrior ghosts.
