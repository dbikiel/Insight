Fed up with the raising crime in Miami, the police chief and the leading members of the city council hire a former Miami gangster, gone straight, to help eliminate the biggest crime syndicate in the city.
When Miami, Florida became national headquarters for a ten billion dollar crime syndicate ruled by crime-czar Tomy Brill (Luther Adler), whose chief henchman is Ted Delacorte (John Baer), a citizen's committee enlists the aid of a reformed gangster Mick Flakk (Barry Sullivan), a widower with a ten-year-old son, pretends to move in on Brill's rackets. Brill's henchmen beat up a woman,Holly Abbott (Beverly Garland), whom Flagg has befriended to get the dope on Flagg's plans, he orders the police to raid the syndicate's gambling-club. Brill counters by having Flagg's son, Gil Flagg (David Kasday), kidnapped.
