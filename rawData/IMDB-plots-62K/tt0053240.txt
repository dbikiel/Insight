Based on Finnish mythology, this movie traces the exploits of Lemminkainen as he woos the fair Annikki and battles the evil witch Louhi. Louhi kidnaps Annikki to compel her father to build for her a Sampo, a magical device that creates salt, grain, and gold. When Lemminkainen tries (and fails) to recover the Sampo, Louhi steals the sun, plunging the world into frozen darkness.
Classical myth from the Kalevala, the Finnish national epic. The sister of master blacksmith/magician Ilmarinen falls in love. This is a sign that the time has come for Ilmarinen to create the Sampo, a magic mill that makes silver and gold, flour and salt. When evil witch Loukhi's initial plan to acquire the Sampo is foiled, she retaliates by stealing the sun right out of the sky.
