The plot couldn't be simpler or its attack on capital punishment (and the act of killing in general) more direct - a senseless, violent, almost botched murder is followed by a cold, calculated, flawlessly performed execution (both killings shown in the most graphic detail imaginable), while the murderer's idealistic young defence lawyer ends up as an unwilling accessory to the judicial murder of his client.
A young man wanders the city with sinister intents. He crosses paths with a taxicab driver. At the same time an idealistic lawyer who has just passed the bar exam thinks about his future. He later finds himself assigned to the young man's case.
A youth randomly, and brutally, murders a taxi-driver. Piotr has just passed his law exams and been admitted to the bar. He is to defend Jacek, the young murderer. There is no evidence for the defence and no apparent motive. Jacek is put on trial, found guilty and executed by hanging. Piotr, after his first case, is left with the bitter doubt - does the legal system, in the name of the people, have the right to kill in cold blood?
Do you know how hard it is to kill a human being? How ugly, messy, long, real and sinful? Do you see a difference between killing for crime and killing for justice? Watch this film. It's an expanded version of Kieslowski's fifth Dekalog - ''Do not kill!'' and it will mercilessly reawaken our dulled by US TV drama and mass media sensibilities concerning what is death, what is murder and what is human
