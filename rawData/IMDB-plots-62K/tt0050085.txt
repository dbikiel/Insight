Aliens take 5 people, give them small capsules which can kill mankind without additional damage, with the understanding they will colonize Earth only if they use the weapons.
Five individuals from five nations, including the "Superpowers," USA, USSR, and China, suddenly find themselves on an alien spacecraft. An alien gives each a container holding capsules. No power on earth can open a given container except a mental command from the person to whom it is given. Each person has been provided with the power of life and death. Any of these individuals has the capability to instantaneously launch the capsules to whatever coordinates he/she chooses, and each capsule will then eradicate all human life within a 3,000-mile radius of its designated location.
Five Earthlings are abducted by aliens and are each given a capsule which can release a weapon so deadly that all of human-kind will be destroyed. This is a test of sorts: if all 5 can resist using the weapon for 27 days, mankind will continue on Earth but should any one of them release the weapon, all human life will be destroyed and the aliens will take the Earth as their new home. When their alien abductor makes the identities of the five known in a world-wide broadcast, they all become hunted either by the curious or their own governments. As the paranoia mounts, man threatens to destroy itself through war, without the use of the alien weapon.
