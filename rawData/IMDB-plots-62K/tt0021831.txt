A spider sneaks into the Sphinx and has several spooky encounters.
A spider descends into the sphinx; we follow behind it in a fairly impressive tracking shot. It reaches the central chamber and the mummies come to life and dance, as do the soldiers and royalty drawn on the wall. This includes a spirited chariot race. All the activity ultimately scares the spider, and it runs out.
