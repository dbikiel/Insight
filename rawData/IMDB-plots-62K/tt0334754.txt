Romance blooms between two soldiers (Knoller, Levi) stationed in an Israeli outpost on the Lebanese border.
Yossi is a Commander at an Israeli outpost near Lebanon. He is however involved in a secret, passionate love affair with his second in command (nicknamed Jagger). The two will often sneak off from the outpost to spend time together. A failed ambush during a full moon leaves Jagger mortally wounded and forces Yossi to finally express his love.
