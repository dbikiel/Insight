Lonely guy Fred Stoller is thrilled when his good buddy, Vinnie D'Angelo, the world's happiest agoraphobic and fattest vegetarian, comes to live with him, until Vinnie also proves to be the world's most maddening roommate.
Fred Stoller works as an actor in Hollywood, playing an assortment of deliverymen, clerks, and other oddball schnooks. The rest of the time he wanders the streets researching his pet book project, Restaurants You Dont Feel Self-Conscious Eating Alone At. He has a long distance bond with his old friend from back East, Vinnie DAngelo, who these days hardly ever leaves his rent-free basement apartment. Fred calls Vinnie whenever he has an odd anecdote to relate about some dumb thing he overheard a lady say at the post office or how the owner of a video store refused to wish him a Happy Holiday because Fred was renting a porno on Christmas. For Vinnie, these mundane stories are great adventures. Its a quirky, symbiotic relationship where Fred provides Vinnie with a window to the outside world, while Vinnie is the adoring parent Fred never had. That relationship is put to the test when Vinnie ventures cross country to stay with Fred to give show business a try. At first, Fred is thrilled to have the company and eager to give Vinnie a live tour of his crazy life, but soon feels trapped when Vinnie quickly reverts to his agoraphobic ways. Will Fred be able to overcome his meek nature and get rid of Vinnie? Is Vinnie a freeloading conman taking advantage of an old friend or just a well-meaning guy who is truly incapable of dealing with the world? One things for sure. Everybody knows a Vinnie.
