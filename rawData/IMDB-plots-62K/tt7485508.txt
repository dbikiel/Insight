The love story of two roma women.
17-year-old Carmen lives in a gypsy community in the suburbs of Madrid and works with her family in a street market. Like every other woman she has ever met, she is destined to live a life that is repeated generation after generation: getting married and raising as many children as possible. She gets engaged to Rafa. But one day she meets 16-year-old Lola, an uncommon gypsy girl who dreams about going to university, draws bird graffiti and likes girls. She also helps her family in the street market. They quickly develop a complicity with each other and discover a world that, inevitably, leads them to be rejected by their families.
