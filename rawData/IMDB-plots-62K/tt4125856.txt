Curtis Duffy, one of the country's most renowned chefs, is building his dream restaurant despite the nightmarish state of his personal life. The recipient of two coveted Michelin stars, Duffy has a laser focus on his cooking career that cost him his marriage and two young daughters. His ambition is to make his Chicago restaurant, Grace, the best in the country. FOR GRACE follows the building of the restaurant from concrete box to its opening night. It also revisits Duffy's turbulent childhood: how a teacher recognized talent in a troubled teenager; how an unimaginable family tragedy made Duffy seek refuge in the kitchen; and how cooking took from him as much as it gave.
