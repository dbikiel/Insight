Nino Culotta is an Italian immigrant who arrived in Australia with the promise of a job as a journalist on his cousin's magazine, only to find that when he gets there the magazine's folded, the cousins done a runner &amp; the money his cousin sent for the fare was borrowed from the daughter of the boss of a local construction firm. So Nino tries to get a job &amp; finishes up ... laying bricks. Nino works hard &amp; makes friends with lots of locals, Nino &amp; Kay argue a lot, Nino &amp; Kay fall in love ... Kay takes Nino to meet 'Daddy' but daddy hates journalists, immigrants and bricklayers (he's now BOSS of a construction firm). Nino starts to win him over with his charm &amp; determination to marry Kay.
