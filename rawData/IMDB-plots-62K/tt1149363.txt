One day, Yuki's mother informs her that she will be divorcing her father and that she will be taking Yuki to live in Japan with her. Yuki is strongly against moving to Japan, and, with Nina's help, they attempt to stop the divorce. However, when their plans fail, running away together seems to be the only solution.
