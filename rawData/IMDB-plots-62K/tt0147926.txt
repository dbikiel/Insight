Thomas M. Disch's underwhelming sequel, based on the book sequel, has our heroes zooming off to, of all places, Mars.
Robbie, the master's baby, has been mysteriously beamed to Mars. It's up to our heroes plus a houseful of new friends - a fan, microwave, calculator, bag of cheddar-flavored popcorn and "the contraption in the junk drawer"- to reach for the stars and bring him safely home.
