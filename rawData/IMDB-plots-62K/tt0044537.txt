A romanticized history of the building of the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railroad in the Colorado mountains.
Edmund O'Brien and his team of railroading men try to build a rail line through a mountain pass, while a group of less scrupulous construction workers sabotage the entire operation in the hopes that they can get their tracks laid first and get the money from the railroad.
