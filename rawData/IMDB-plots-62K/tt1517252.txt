In the summer of 2003, a group of shepherds took a herd of sheep one final time through the Beartooth Mountains of Montana, in the extreme north-west of the United States. It was a journey of almost three hundred kilometres through expansive green valleys, by fields of snow, and across hazardous, narrow ridges - a journey brimming with challenges. The aging shepherds do their very best to keep the hundreds of sheep together; the panoramic high mountains are teeming with hungry wolves and grizzly bears.
There is no plot, per se in this film. It is a "pure" documentary; i.e., insofar as the filmmakers can accomplish it, they have made the viewers non-participating observers on an actual sheep drive. Everything that happens in the film is unmodified by information, explanation, interviews or artificial soundtrack. Characters are a huge herd of sheep; relatively few drivers on horseback; pack mules; herding dogs. Together we are coping with dense forests; rocky terrain; harsh weather; unmarked territory; wildlife predators; fatigue -- all while managing the necessary supplies for sustaining a group on the move in the wilderness for several months. Formidable obstacles and concomitant frustrations are at times overwhelming, even for these experienced, stoic range riders. True to their natures and heritage, they persevere to the end of the drive, as has been the case since the 1800's.
