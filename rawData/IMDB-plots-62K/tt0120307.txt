Father Antonio is a priest by vocation, committed and generous, dear people of Vila Daires a quiet village of the north. But Father Anthony is also a man, and Vila Daires is not as peaceful as it seems. The good intentions of the Father will not be sufficient to halt the worsening of the conflict. And when your fate intersects with Lena, the "black sheep" of the village, Father will also be forced to confront his own demons. Especially with those who never even thought that could exist.
Antonio, a young catholic priest at Vila Daires, a little village in the northern mountain range of Portugal, has an encompassing love for everybody, devout and miscreants alike. Lena, a young single mother who lived in Lisbon several years, returns to her home after serving time for drugs possession and consumption. Antonio tries to help Lena re-start her life, but her beauty wakens his inner demons, and he gets in the middle of a racist rejection of a gypsy tribe by the villagers, who accuse them of being drug pushers and the priest of helping them.
