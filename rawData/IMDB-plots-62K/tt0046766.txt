The schoolgirls of St. Trinian's are more interested in racing forms than books as they try to get-rich-quick. They are abetted by the headmistress' brother.
The arrival of Sultan's daughter Princess Fatima at England's famous and prestigious 'School for Young Ladies' precipitates even more chaos than usual. Her father's horse Arab Boy is due to run at the nearby Gold Cup so Clarence Fitton, bookie brother of headmistress Millicent, ensures his own daughter is on hand to report progress. At the same time Barchester police have planted sergeant Ruby Gates as a teacher, and the Ministry of Education are sending a third inspector down after the previous two disappeared without trace.
Those wonderful hellcats created by cartoonist Ronald Searle appear on film at last. The school is bankrupt (as usual) but an Arab sheik sends Princess Fatima, his daughter, with 100 pounds pocket money to that prestigious finishing School for Young Ladies. The same sheik has a racehorse, Arab Boy, at a local stables to run at the nearby Gold Cup. The Princess has a secret mission as informant to her father, because horse betting, and crime associated with it, are rampant. Soon, everyone is trying to either back the horse, nobble it or rescue the poor horse. These famous schoolgirls battle against the headmistress Millicent, Clarence Fitton, her bookie brother (played by the same actor as Millicent...), the local Barchester police, and the Ministry of Education's inspector - after two other school inspectors disappeared without trace. Mainly, schoolgirls battle all authority figures, and still have time to fight each other.
