Clive Riordan plans a devilish revenge against his wife's lover.
London psychiatrist Clive Riordan, royally fed up with the repeated affairs of his wife Storm, plots a seemingly 'perfect' revenge against her latest lover, American Bill Kronin. Catching them in the act, he marches Bill off at gunpoint; and from the viewpoint of Storm and the rest of the world, Bill simply vanishes. But there's far more to the meticulously worked out plot than Clive's victims suspect, with the end slowly preparing in his private laboratory. Enter a mild-mannered Scotland Yard man, who seemingly has no clue beyond a missing dog...
Dr. Clive Riordan's beautiful-but-flirty wife, "Storm", comes home one night in the company of an American diplomat, Bill Kronin. Riordan, obsessed with jealousy, determines to murder his most recent rival and plans, as only a psychiatrist would, to not only kill bill, but to commit the perfect crime in the process. And will do so, if he can just keep 'Monty," his wife's pet dog from sniffing around the premises.
