In fact, the actor intends to use the kid to provide him with poison. He starts telling a marvelous fairy tale. "Yo-ho-ho" - this old refrain of a pirate song is all too familiar. For the sake of the boy the Actor invents stories about the good buccaneer who is fighting the evil ruler Alvarez who must be punished for his crimes. Little by little the real people in hospital are transformed into the imaginary heroes of the pirate stories that the Actor and the child vanquished by goodness, honesty and self-denial. The boy is fascinated. Gradually, this pre-planned friendship develops into sincere devotion and affection.
