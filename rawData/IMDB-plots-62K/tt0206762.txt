A gay couple are hit men for the mafia.
Children and parents. In New York City, Stephen and Danny live well: they're smooth, cool, in love, and good at what they do. Stephen's Midwestern parents pay them a surprise visit. Meanwhile, Jenny and Damon tell their parents they are engaged: Matt's parents, Midwestern paramilitary fanatics, take it as a sign to gather their group to invade New York. Jenny's father is the local Mob boss who employs Stephen and Danny as enforcers. He's unhappy that Jenny is marrying someone who is neither Sicilian nor Catholic. Stephen's parents know he's gay, they just don't know what his job is. Here come the parents; will the children survive? All roads lead to the engagement party.
Handsome and in love gay couple Stephen and Danny work as New York City mob enforcers. Their boss, Victor Patrizz, would like his sons to be as capable and respected in the business (that is, feared) as these two, for between the sons, one yearns only to be a chef while the other a decorator and clothing designer. Events converge toward an elegant but chaotic dinner party: Stephen's parents, who know he's gay but think he's a caterer, pull a surprise visit for Stephen's father's birthday. The father, an undercover FBI man, will have to arrest them if he learns the couple's true vocation. Meanwhile, Victor's daughter Jenny announces her engagement to Damon, a man who is neither Sicilian nor Catholic (two reasons Victor might have the guy whacked). Damon's parents, however, see the news differently - as a sign for their paramilitary group to engage a hostile takeover of New York City.
