In the slum of Capão Redondo in São Paulo, the twenty-third anniversary of Marco Aurélio a.k.a. Macu will be celebrated with a "feijoada" (a typical Brazilian dish of black beans and pork) and beers promoted by his mother Dona Sônia and their closest friends. Among the guests are Macu's childhood best friends Jaiminho, who plays soccer in Spain and is waiting to be summoned by the coach to the national team, and Pibe, who has a baby and is living with Macu's former girlfriend Claudia. Macu owes money to the dangerous criminal Serjão and Napão and will host a boy that will be kidnapped by the delinquents in order to pay for his debts. Along the day, Macu stays with Jaiminho and Pibe recalling their childhood together. By the end of the day, Serjão and Napão tell Macu that they have changed their plans and the kid will not be kidnapped, but Jaiminho instead. Further, he shall meet the powerful Dr. Venceslau for further instructions. Now Macu is to be on the horns of a dilemma between his friendship for Jaiminho and the fear for the gang of his slum.
