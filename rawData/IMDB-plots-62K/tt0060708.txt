A spy spoof in the 1960s tradition, featuring the comic book heroine Modesty Blaise (Monica Vitti) set in the Italian Mediterranean.
Modesty Blaise (Monica Vitti), a secret agent whose hair color, hair style, and mod clothing change at a snap of her fingers, is being used by the British government as a decoy in an effort to thwart a diamond heist. She is being set-up by the feds, but is wise to the plot, and calls in sidekick Willie Garvin (Terence Stamp) and a few other friends to outsmart them. Meanwhile, at his island hideaway, Gabriel (Sir Dirk Bogarde), the diamond thief, has his own plans for Blaise and Garvin.
Great Britain is giving fifty million pounds sterling worth of diamonds to a Middle East sheik in return for oil concessions. There are rumors of a plot by archcriminal Gabriel (Sir Dirk Bogarde) to steal the diamonds, so the Secret Service Chief seeks the help of sexy spy Modesty Blaise (Monica Vitti), who brings along her sidekick Willie Garvin (Terence Stamp).
