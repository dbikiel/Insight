An ultra-orthodox scholar is revived after dying for 40 minutes. After coming back to life, he suddenly feels a strange awakening in his body and suspects that God is testing him.
Haim-Aaron is an ultra-Orthodox religious scholar from Jerusalem whose talent and devotion are envied by all. One evening, following a self-imposed fast, he collapses and loses consciousness in the bathroom. The paramedics announce his death, but his father, refusing to let him go, takes over resuscitation efforts and, beyond all expectations, he comes back to life. After the accident, the scholar remains apathetic to his studies. He suddenly feels a strange awakening in his body and suspects that God is testing him. When his father notices these changes in his son's behavior, he tries to forgive him, tormented by the fear that he has crossed God's will when he resuscitated him.
