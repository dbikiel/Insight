A sociology student defends her thesis: how Italian men relate to prostitutes. The catch is, she studied the subject first hand, working as a prostitute. Her case studies are presented in several colorful vignettes.
Diana Tornetti sits for her oral defense of her sociology thesis - a study of Italian men and their treatment of prostitutes. But the real catch is that the comely Ms. Tornetti studied the subject first hand - as a working prostitute! She relates some of her more memorable case studies, including (among others) a distraught industrialist, an eager widower, a lucky courier, a philandering politician, a concerned father, a frustrated Mafioso, a pornographer, a lunatic and a role-playing executive. Although initially shocked, the review panel is ultimately won over by Ms. Tornetti's colorful defense of her thesis.
