A painful tale about marriage, bad sex and requited love.
After the birth of two children Simon's (Joel Edgerton) marriage to Pam (Danielle Cormack) is becoming a bore in which the only climactic feelings he has involve an unfortunate new tendency for premature ejaculation. He develops an interest in another young mother, Katrien (Rhona Mitra), whose husband Klaus has been cheating on her. The world of young married parents in Wellington is fast leading to a whole new breed of men: the men of 'Separation City'.
Separation City is a bittersweet comedy drama about falling out of love for the very first time. A painful lesson about how unrequited love lasts forever and while requited love comes with a use-by date. A story about courtship, mateship and jumping ship. A film for anyone who has ever been in a relationship and woken up beside someone they once adored beyond measure and thought even fleetingly, is this it?
