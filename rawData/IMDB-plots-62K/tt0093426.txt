Hong Kong native Jennifer (Cherie Chung) moves to New York City to study for her Master's Degree and to reunite with her boyfriend Vincent (Danny Chan Bak-Keung). There, she meets her very distant relative Samuel Pang (Yun-Fat Chow), a street smart and wise-talking waiter-by-day and gambler-by-night, who helps Jennifer settle in her apartment building in the outskirts of Brooklyn.

But, Pang talks sense into her and helps her adjust to her new life in the Big Apple and without Vincent, resulting in an unlikely relationship.
