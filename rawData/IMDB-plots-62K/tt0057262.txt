On the French Riviera, a professional matchmaker assisted by an American adventurer arranges for convenience marriages between titled impoverished aristocratic men and rich low-bred women.
Etienne makes a good living out of marrying off poor but titled young men to rich but untitled young ladies. Millicent is now in his sights on the Riviera, and Grand Duke Gaspar is the bait. But what if Millicent starts to fancy planted chauffeur John instead, and Gaspar takes a shine to Etienne's secretary Janine?
