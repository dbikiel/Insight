A developer attempts to sabotage the safety record of a ski resort.
The Snowy Peaks ski patrol is one diverse crew. They consist of Jerry, the senior member who loves skiing and is in love with Ellen, a ski school instructor at Snowy Peaks; Iceman, singer and master of impressions; Eddie, the demolition and explosives expert; Stanley, who has failed to make the patrol seven years in a row; and Tiana, a foreign exchange patroller who likes Stanley. While having fun and keeping the mountain safe, they try to save the lodge from greedy land developer, Sam Maris.
