A survival story about a boy named Sami who is committed to a youth mental institute. Sami is completely introverted and won't speak to his roommate or his orderly. Also, his arm is broken. Sami's mother insists that her son is completely well and does not need the help of the institute. She is convinced that Sami is just getting over his parents recent divorce. Through flash-backs into Samis recent life we begin to find out exactly what led to Sami being committed. Slowly Sami starts to heal. Unfortunately Samis mental health comes at a price which Sami must pay.
Following a suicide attempt, 17-year-old Sami has been placed in a young people's psychiatric home. His arm in a sling, his face hidden by his long hair, he refuses to speak about what has happened. For the most part, Sami is a quiet lad, but occasionally he has outbursts so extreme that the staff tie him to his bed. However, one carer, Taneli, gradually manages to get him to open up. Sami's parents are divorced, his father lives in Sweden. His somewhat neurotic and over-protective mother wants Sami to come back to her. But to everyone's surprise, Sami would rather stay in the psychiatric home - until he finally reveals the secret reason for his act of desperation.
