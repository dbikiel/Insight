A story about two girls, CJ and Hanna. CJ lives on a ranch, Hanna comes to visit and decides to photograph wild horses for a school project. The girls become great friends and learn of a plot that might jeopardize the mustangs.
Workaholic widower Frank arranges for his daughter Hanna, who loves photography and horses, to send a summer month on the ranch of his study friend Matty, who instructs her tomcat daughter CJ to act as her friend. The site is one of the locations rumored to harbor the legendary last truly wild mustang stallion, who keeps joining and helping roaming herds. Industrialist Novak hired locals, lead by mean deputy Morgan, to catch wild horses for experiments.
