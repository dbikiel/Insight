Grant Fuhr was the first black superstar in hockey. He won 403 regular season NHL games and is a member of the 2003 class of the Hockey Hall of Fame. Making Coco is the story of Fuhr's life, on and off the ice.
Barely 19, Grant 'Coco' Fuhr became starting goalie for the most exciting team in NHL history. In his mid-30's, he played 79 games in an 82-game season to set a league record, then followed that iron-man performance by playing 73 the following season on a completely rebuilt knee. During the decade and a half between, he employed his acrobatic style and cat-like reflexes to backstop five Stanley Cup champions and two Canada Cup winners, cementing a reputation as the ultimate "money goalie". He also got himself demoted to the minors for calling the hometown fans jerks, announced his retirement at the age of 26 in an attempt to force a famously hard-nosed general manager to renegotiate a long-term contract, and was suspended for an entire NHL season for conduct deemed "dishonourable and against the welfare of the league" for cocaine use, only to return and redeem himself as one of the game's true greats.
Grant "Coco" Fuhr is the quiet, yet confident goalie who broke barriers as the first black superstar in hockey. He was the first, and to this day the only, black player in the Hockey Hall of Fame. With Grant in net, the Edmonton Oilers' dynasty of the 1980's is often referred to as the greatest team of all time backstopped by the greatest goalie of all time. Sidelined with a year-long drug suspension at the pinnacle of his five-time championship career, Grant beat the odds to achieve continued success as a player, and set more records...still unbroken to this day.
