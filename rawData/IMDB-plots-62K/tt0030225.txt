Cpl. Jim of the R.C.M.P. is taking his daughter Julie to school in Edmonton on the Arctic Queen. Six men hold up the boat when they stop for wood and gun down Jim in front of his daughter. The new inspector sends Alan after them, but has him split his unit. This leaves Alan short and they are ambushed and forced to bring back his wounded comrade. At Fort Endurance, Alan is confined to quarters for not arresting Dave when some of the stolen furs are found in his shed. Elizabeth lies about Dave being part of the gang to have Alan thrown out of the Mounties. When the other Mounties go out on a long chase, the only chance Alan and Bill have in finding the bandits is to take the forestry plane and search the lakes and rivers.
