A mother bird tries to teach her little one how to find food by herself. In the process, she encounters a traumatic experience that she must overcome in order to survive.
A young and bright-eyed Sandpiper is motivated by her mother to start hunting for food along with the rest of the flock in the sandy seashore. However, the tiny bird is still terrorised by the surfs that break on the ocean's shoreline, unable to take care of herself. Poor little Piper, growing up is difficult, nevertheless, your caring mother believes in you.
