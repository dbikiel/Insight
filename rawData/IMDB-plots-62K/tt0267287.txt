In a dystopian world, a woman spends her time playing an illegal and dangerous game, hoping to find meaning in her world.
In a future world, young people are increasingly becoming addicted to an illegal (and potentially deadly) battle simulation game called Avalon. When Ash, a star player, hears of rumors that a more advanced level of the game exists somewhere, she gives up her loner ways and joins a gang of explorers. Even if she finds the gateway to the next level, will she ever be able to come back to reality?
Gloomy portrayal of the near future in an imaginary town in Central Europe, shot in Poland (Polish is also spoken). The town is dirty and chaotic. Computer games have lost their innocence: they are addictive and large sums of money can be won. Ash lives alone. She doesn't have any contact with other people, only with her dog. Her only activities are cooking meals for the dog and playing games. She is a professional Avalon super warrior, a player on the top-level, that is only accessible under very specific conditions. Once a player is inside, they can only stop by winning the game. Otherwise the player can die. Ash ignores all warnings and decides to play anyway.
