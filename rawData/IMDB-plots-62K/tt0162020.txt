A beautiful actress invites Cantinflas to work at a film studio, where he falls asleep and dreams he is D'Artagnan.
This is a parody of Alexander's Dumas "The Three Musketeers". Cantinflas is Dartagnan, the skillful leader of the musketeers, and will fight with the evil Cardinal Richelieu, who wants to take the power of France in the XVII Century. But Dartagnan and his fellows will stop him, using his sword and his funny speech pattern.
