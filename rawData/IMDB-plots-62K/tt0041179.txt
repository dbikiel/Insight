Billy Coy, brash young midget car race driver, lives in the shadow of his famous father, a drunken womanizer, who was killed in an accident years earlier. His mantra that he's going "to drive over" everyone comes back to haunt him when his best friend is killed during a race. Everyone assumes that his ruthless driving style was the cause of the fatality, and it takes the love of a pretty tomboy working as a mechanic and his loyal mother to believe in him and his ability to overcome the resentment and redeem himself.
