Mr Hublot is a withdrawn, idiosyncratic character with OCD, scared of change and the outside world. Robot Pet's arrival turns his life upside down: he has to share his home with this very invasive companion.
OCD sufferer Mr Hublot lives in a frightening, fully automated world from which he hides, working from home. One day he spies an abandoned robot dog about to be crushed with the garbage and rescues it. The dog makes Mr Hublot very happy but it grows to an enormous size, forcing Mr Hublot to embrace a welcoming change as they move to larger premises.
The eccentric and silent OCD-ridden recluse, Mr Hublot, prefers leading a solitary life in his small apartment, somewhere in a bleak and mechanical city. Spending his well-ordered life from the safety of his home, Mr Hublot's perfect world will turn upside down with the arrival of a poor and helpless stray dog--Robot Pet. Will Mr Hublot make a choice to take a chance on him, and risk everything?
