Chunga-Changa, no better place, Chunga-Changa, no troubles to face. Chunga-Changa, one who'd been just once, Chunga-Changa, will not leave he us.
This is the story of a small boat "Siskin", which carries loads on the river. He brings newspapers to loggers, medicines to the hospital and magazines to a teacher at the coastal school. Once he decided to compete with the ocean liner and got into a storm, which threw him on the tropical island of Chunga-Changa, where he met the black children, the Giraffe, the Parrot and the Dolphins.
