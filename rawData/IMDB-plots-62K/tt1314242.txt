Evil 2 picks up right where the original left off and explains where the "evil" came from originally. Melitis, Marina, Jenny, and Vakirtzis are still on the run from the endless horde of undead that are devouring all of Greece. As it turns out; this is not the first time that "the evil" has taken over Greece and as before, a "messenger from the gods (Billy Zane)" has come to Earth to find "the heroes" who will defeat the evil and save the world.
