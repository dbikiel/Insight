A quick witted, edgy romantic dramedy about a young successful Manhattan investment banker living the charmed life about to marry the woman of his dreams who, a month before his wedding, meets and unexpectedly falls in love with a charismatic man from his past.
Hunky Daniel couldn't have it better - great parents, a successful career as an investment banker and engaged to be married to the beautiful Jen. A perfect life...but there is this one temptation that may derail his hoped-for straight-and-narrow life and that comes in the form of Tommy, a charming former college classmate, now openly gay. After a few drinks, Daniel succumbs to his repressed desires and makes a one time "mistake." Soon after their initial tryst, the normally jaded Tommy falls head over heels in love, but Daniel wants nothing more of him or his dazzlingly seductive smile - he's back with Jen, determined to marry her. With Tommy's friends warning him against his involvement with a straight man and Daniel's pledge of heterosexually, it would seem that nothing will come of them...but love and lust has a way of messing up even the best laid plans of man. A refreshingly funny story of coming out as well as a belated coming-of-age tale that sparkles with witty dialogue and believable characters.
