Toby, a gifted chemist slumming as a high school teacher, stops on a quiet stretch of Ozark highway to help an alluring young girl named Laurie whose car trouble--and attraction to the handsome stranger--pales in the face of her real problems: She's on the run from police and involved in a dangerous criminal debt with Jeff, her violent, on-again, off-again boyfriend, who also cons a ride from Toby. With Laurie as a grudging accomplice, Jeff kidnaps Toby to an abandoned farm, hoping to force him to cook synthetic heroin in order to pay off 'Familia Sin Amore', the group of vicious Bolivian drug traffickers to whom he's desperately in debt. When Toby proves unwilling, Jeff with the help of a local thug named Judge Bass, kidnaps Annette, Toby's ex-wife. The criminals hold her as security, threatening to frame Toby for her murder should he escape. The situation grows ever more tense as Toby asks for a share of the profits, Laurie disappears, Annette refuses to play the victim, and Familia Sin Amore comes to collect....
