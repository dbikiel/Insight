After being convicted for fraud, one month has passed since CHOI Chang-Hyuk's release from jail. But this time around he's got an elaborate plan cooked up. It's the biggest bank heist in history. The best five thieves come together to form a team. Starting with CHOI Chang-Hyuk, the brain behind the perfect plan : Master KIM, the godfather of Master KIM, the godfather of swindlers; Big Mouth, a guy who can talk people into anything; Swallow, a remarkable lady-killer; and Gasoline, who has a gift for counterfeiting. But the only drawback is that they all can't trust each other. They have only one goal - to hit a bank for 5 billion won ($5 million)- but each one of them has their own plan in mind.
