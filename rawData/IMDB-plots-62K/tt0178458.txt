Claude Codgen, Bob Purvey, and Mary Lou McGinnis are a trio of eager and intrepid young surfers who form a group called the Surf Corps so they can travel all over the world in search of fun, thrills, and waves. Their eventful and adventurous odyssey takes them to such exotic far-flung places as Portugal, Morocco, Ceylon, Hong Kong, Japan, and Hawaii.
