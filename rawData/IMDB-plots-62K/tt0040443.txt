The Huggett family go to a holiday camp, and get involved in crooked card players, a murderer on the run, and a pregnant young girl and her boyfriend missing from home.
Mr. and Mrs. Average British Family...if the average British family consists of a husband, wife, widowed daughter and an adventurous son...go to a holiday camp, and encounter many people who are there for various and sundry reasons; a young, unmarried couple who are about to become parents sans wedlock; a sadist eluding Scotland Yard and looking for more sadist activities; a husband-seeking spinster; two would-be gamblers looking just to make expenses; and a middle-aged matron on her first holiday after years of taking care of her invalid mother.
