In 1961, Chas and Leroy, two fun-loving military serviceman who had enough of the service, leave Panama as stowaways in a military cargo plane flying for the States. Leroy is not satisfied with compensation for his army days, so he smuggles with him one box of military supplies, which he plans to sell in the USA. He tries out a military camera on some military base they fly over and throws away the photos. In the states, an army cleaner finds photos inside the plane and alerts his superiors. They think the stowaways are communist spies and the base starts a frantic search.
