Year 1977. Punk and new wave rock'n roll has arrived to remote Finland and a bleak small town Oulu where increasingly odd-looking youths began to appear in the street with a message. Their rebellion speaks to V채lde (17). V채lde dreams of joining a rock band and becoming famous. He wants to get drunk for the first time, and to win the love of Pike, the most beautiful girl in the class. When Pike wins the Miss Blue Jeans contest organized by the country's leading (and only) pop music magazine Suosikki and takes as her boyfriend the bourgeois Henri Hakala, V채lde puts all his eggs in one basket. He abandons his former self and begins purposefully constructing a new persona for himself. But everything doesn't go as V채lde wanted.
