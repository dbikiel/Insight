Determined to kill his wife's lover, a middle-class accountant attempts to purchase a .38 from an inner-city crackhead, unaware the gun actually belongs to a psychotic drug lord who'd kill to get his weapon back.
Upper middle class employee Tom ventures into a derelict squatter building to buy a gun from D, a cocky but stupid, homeless crack-junkie, who meanly tries to extort above the agreed price. As D stole the gun from his macho dealer Hoodwink, the bully is on the warpath to get it back by beating up all his pushers in turn and order them to get it, anyhow. Tom's attempts to reason with Hoodwink or buy off his wrath only get him seriously abused. He and D gradually get to know what makes the other tick and digress for reasonable life.
Tom (Steven Mackintosh) is a middle-class city boy whose life
has reached breaking point. D (Ashley Walters) is a young
crack-head: smart, witty, desperate. Tom is completely out
of his depth when he finds himself in D's abandoned warehouse
attempting to do a "deal" with the energetic, volatile drug addict.
The two enter into an irrational, deadly game of cat and mouse.
The tense drama escalates when psychotic local crime-lord
Hoodwink (Andy Serkis) wakes up to find his snub nose gun missing.
