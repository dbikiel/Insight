A historical drama that illustrates Russian author Leo Tolstoy's (Christopher Plummer's) struggle to balance fame and wealth with his commitment to a life devoid of material things.
The Countess Sofya Andreevna Tolstoy (Dame Helen Mirren), wife and muse to Leo Tolstoy (Christopher Plummer), uses every trick of seduction on her husband's loyal disciple, whom she believes was the person responsible for Tolstoy signing a new will that leaves his work and property to the Russian people.
In 1910, acclaimed Russian author Leo Tolstoy (Christopher Plummer), in the later stage of his life, works rather than a writer, but as the leader of the Tolstoyan Movement, whose basic tenets are brotherly love and world peace through pacifism, and a denouncement of material wealth and physical love. His chief follower is Vladimir Chertkov (Paul Giamatti), who does whatever he requires to advance the cause. Chertkov hires a young man named Valentin Bulgakov (James McAvoy) to be Tolstoy's personal secretary in carrying out this work. Once ensconced in the life on the estate where much of the work is taking place, Bulgakov quickly learns that many there take from the movement only what he or she wants or believes. Also chief amongst the movement's wants is the deeding of all of Tolstoy's writings to the people, so that after his death, it will become public domain. Tolstoy's wife, the Countess Sofya Andreevna Tolstoy (Dame Helen Mirren), believes that her husband's writings are rightfully hers after he dies, as she wants and believes she deserves the monetary benefits derived from such. This places a strain between those in the movement, especially Chertov and the Tolstoys' daughter Sasha (Anne-Marie Duff), and the Countess. Bulgatov acts as the mediator between the parties, he who feels he needs to do what is truly in Tolstoy's heart regardless of what Tolstoy may say or do.
