Haunted by recent events and on the run, a man finds himself the unwitting pawn of a possessed evangelical radio station and like his unfortunate predecessor must ask himself whether it is better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.
Cocky investment analyst Sam Larson has a lot on his mind. After a financial scam goes horribly wrong, he hits the road in a desperate bid to out run his guilt. A fragment of a radio broadcast that may or may not be a distress call lures him to an isolated transmitting station and into a terrifying mystery of murder, madness and the insatiable hunger of a power beyond his comprehension.
After a little embezzlement by financial business person Sam Larson (Eric Lange) leads to the suicide of Sam's boss (Ray Wise) - who rather ironically was also the person who put the whole idea into his employee's head -, Sam goes on the run, driving across the USA in the sort of blind flight across highways that has never ended too well in any film.
At night, the broadcast of a religious nutcase radio station turns into a sort of emergency call, pleading for anyone hearing it to come to the station and help out with some sort of medical emergency.
Sam's not planning on answering the call, but ends up at the radio station regardless. Inside the building, he finds the aftermath of a fight (though strangely enough no bodies) and a man, probably the DJ/preacher (John Billingsley) handcuffed to a radiator. It is obvious that something terrible and deeply strange has happened there.

But the isolated highway leads him into an even more terrifying situation amid madness and murder. [D-Man2010]
