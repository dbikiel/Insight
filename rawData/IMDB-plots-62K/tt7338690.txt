The Scorpion King teams up with a female warrior named Tala, who is the sister of The Nubian King. Together they search for a legendary relic known as The Book of Souls, which will allow them to put an end to an evil warlord.
In ancient Egypt, the mighty warlord, Nebserek, steals the fabled Fang of Anubis--a cursed sword imbued with the power of hell and the strength of its countless victims--intent on creating his evil empire. As the ruthless monarch burns down to the ground a small village, the wounded Akkadian mercenary, Mathayus, joins forces with the Nubian princess, Tala, to embark on a long and dangerous quest to find the mystical Book of Souls: the only thing that can put an end to Nebserek's tyranny. Will the legendary Scorpion King bring hope and restore peace?
