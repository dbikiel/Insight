Two brothers go to France to claim the chateau they have inherited.
When two American brothers, Graham and Allen Granville, learn that they have inherited a chateau in France, they cannot believe their luck. However, when they arrive, the brothers find themselves completely ill-equipped to communicate with the chateau's staff (even with the help of a pocket dictionary). With no hope of paying off the chateau's enormous debt, the pair are forced to sell the chateau, leaving a bewildered staff resorting to desperate and hilarious measures to keep their home. Through a series of comedic misunderstandings, the film's stars not only uncover they're not as distant from the staff as they might think, they also discover something about the importance of family.
Graham, an annoying, nerdy guy, and his adopted brother Allen, who now insists on calling himself Rex, arrive in France because their great-uncle died and left a mansion to them. But the staff at the mansion is unprepared for their arrival; Graham's limited French skills meant he didn't realize that the repetition of "C'est qui?" on their phone call meant they were asking who he was, and instead thought they would be bringing a key when they met him. Graham's overreaching his French abilities bring continued complications; meanwhile, both brothers find themselves falling for the winsome Isabelle, daughter of the butler, Jean, and mother of a small boy. And when the brothers try to sell the mansion, the staff reveals more of their skills to prevent the sale.
