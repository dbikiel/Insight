After a difficult romance in a class-divided society, the love birds find out marriage is not what they thought it would be.
Karthik (Madhavan) is frantic after the disappearance of his wife Shakti (Shalini). Told in flashbacks, the film traces their brief marriage as the couple's dreamy romance runs through the usual gamut of highs and lows.
Karthik (Madhavan) is bright young engineering graduate. He meets Shakti (Shalini) at a wedding function. She is a medical student who scorns love and romance as trivial diversions. He is immediately attracted to her, but she spurns him. Karthik is relentless and she is driven to admit that yes, she is attracted to him too. All seems set for a big wedding, but their two families meet, fight and totally disapprove of their union. The couple, after a failed attempt to avoid each other, decide to break all rules, move into a dilapidated apartment and start an at-first-blissful married life. What follows are the difficulties of marriage, the misunderstandings, discontentment and consequent fissures that develop in the relationship, causing friction. Karthik is busy and pre-occupied; Shakti begins to feel that he doesn't love her any more and suspects him of having an affair. They fight frequently. Then Shakti disappears. Has she left Karthik because the marriage has become so painful? Will he go in search of her? What will he find? How will their love story progress?
