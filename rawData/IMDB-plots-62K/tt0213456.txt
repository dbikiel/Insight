This film is a 'deconstruction' of 'Dog Star Man'. It takes the four 'rolls' of super-fast edited, often poetic, imagery of 'Dog Star Man' and shows them first combined, then each combination of three rolls(=4) then each combination of two rolls (=6) then each individual roll (=4). The 'plot' is of a man who goes up a mountain with a dog to chop down a tree, but he has some unspecified transcendental experience while he is there.
