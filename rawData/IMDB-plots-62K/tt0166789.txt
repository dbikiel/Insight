26 year old Silvia has it all, but is still discontent, and daydreams about BDSM sex. When her husband is away on a business trip, she goes to a castle outside Rome to work as a secretary. Here she is turned into a slave.
Silvia is young, beautiful and rich. She has everything, but nobody can satisfy her dark sexual needs. When her husband goes on a business trip, she starts working as a secretary for Margaret, a famous film star. Margaret appears to have no problems giving her what she wants and turns her into a sex slave- little by little, she becomes a slave subjecting herself to increasingly serious humiliations in a masochistic relationship.
