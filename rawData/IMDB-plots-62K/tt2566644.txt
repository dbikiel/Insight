In 1986, a group of foreign born Korean teenagers attend a summer camp in South Korea.
During the 1980s, the Korean government created a special summer camp for "gyopo" or foreign born teenagers where they could spend their summer in Seoul to learn about their motherland. While the intentions of the program were honorable, the activities of the teens were not. The program was eventually cancelled after a few years because the government simply could not control the youth. Seoul Searching is a teen comedy and coming of age film, based on a true story about one of the summer camps that took place in 1986.
A group of diverse Korean high school teens from around the globe, come together in 1986 to experience the most important summer of their lives. They meet at a special summer camp in Seoul where they were sent by their parents to learn what it means to be Korean - a side to them they know little about. Although the intentions of the camp were honorable, the activities of the teens were not. The story focuses on three Korean boys from the US, Mexico and Germany and the girls who they meet that summer who change their loves forever.
