Filmed at the Arctic Circle, "The Sun at Midnight" tells the story of an unexpected friendship between a hunter obsessed with finding a missing caribou herd and a teenage rebel who gets lost while on the run.
In this wilderness adventure, Lia, a 16 year-old urban princess, is sent to spend the summer with her Gwich'in grandmother in a small Arctic Circle community. Desperate to return to city life she steals a boat and sets out into the vast Northern wilderness hoping to reach the nearest town. Totally lost, she is discovered by Alfred, a Gwich'in hunter who reluctantly takes her under his wing as he navigates the massive landscape in search of caribou. When Alfred is severely wounded in a bear attack Lia pushes on and fights to save both of their lives.
