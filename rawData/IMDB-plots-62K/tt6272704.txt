Breath is about an Iranian family who live in Iran. It tells the story of Bahar, who is living with her father, Ghafour (Mehran Ahmadi) and Grandmother (Pantea Panahiha) during the 70s. Bahar is living in her childish and surreal world, filled with their dreams and fantasies.
Little Bahar lives a life spun from folklore and stories, always with her head in a book. But growing up in Yazd in the 1970s and '80s, she's at the center of a country in turmoil: the Shah is overthrown, Ayatollah Khomeini rises to power, and the first shots are fired in a bitter and protracted war with Iraq. Over the span of several years, Bahar finds daydreaming in her own fantasy world is the only way she can make sense of the pain and suffering warring humans inflict on one another.
