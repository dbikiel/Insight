Pete and Stick, two juvenile delinquents just thrown out of a biker gang, break into a luxury house where they rape two women. They settle in the house, sell the valuables and kill a curious neighbor.
Sex and ingenious violence abounds in this exploitation drama that chronicles the fate of two soul-less, brutal bikers who burst into a mansion occupied by two luscious young women. The poor women are immediately and painfully violated until one of their husbands, a cellist, comes home.
