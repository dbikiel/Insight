A prince enlists a thief to serve as his bodyguard to protect him from assassins.
Prince Wang is the 11th prince of Manchuria and an excellent martial artist, but prefers not to draw attention to himself and keeps a low profile, posing as a merchant who deals in wine, antiques and paintings. He has a run-in with Ho Jen, a simple thief who makes a living by stealing and spending loot wherever he can. The Prince takes a liking to the thief and enlists him to be his bodyguard, something Ho takes to very reluctantly at first. But when a conspiracy unfolds and the Prince is targeted for assassination, Ho must undertake a serious training regime to protect his master.
