A small-town girl wins a date with a male celebrity through a contest. When the date goes better than expected, a love triangle forms between the girl, the male celebrity, and the girl's best friend.
Rosalee Futch is a grocery clerk living in rural West Virginia. But even a small-town girl can have big dreams, and Rosalee's is to someday--somehow--meet her big-screen idol Tad Hamilton. The somehow arrives in the form of a contest--the grand prize: a date with Tad Hamilton--and the someday is now. Rosalee wins, much to the chagrin of her best friend and co-worker Pete, who is deeply, hopelessly--and secretly--in love with Rosalee. The Win a Date contest was cooked up by Tad's agent, Richard Levy, and his manager, also named Richard Levy, to clean up Tad's bad-boy image. Someone should have told them to be careful what you wish for. When Tad meets Rosalee and gets a taste of what he's been missing in the real world, he decides he wants seconds and moves to West Virginia, turning Rosalee's dream come true into a nightmare for Richard Levy, Richard Levy and, most of all, Pete.
Rosalee Futch (Kate Bosworth), a Piggly Wiggly supermarket checkout girl in a small West Virginia town, wins a contest for a date with Tad Hamilton (Josh Duhamel), a Hollywood movie star. Tad's agents came up with this contest to change Tad's bad-boy image and help his career in getting another big movie part. A date with the sweet and innocent Rosalee is just the ticket that Tad needs, when he falls in love with her. Tad moves to the small town so he can be near Rosalee, and this drives Tad's agents crazy. Rosalee's best friend, Pete (Topher Grace) finally tells Rosalee that he has loved her his whole life. Rosalee must choose between her lifetime friend Pete or Tad, the rich and famous movie star. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy)
