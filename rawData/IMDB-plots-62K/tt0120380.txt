Aliens arrive, parking in a geostationary orbit over Nevada. Using powers unknown to us, they declare war, and use unmanned trucks as weapons.
A small town truck stop is taken over by driver-less trucks. Possibly caused by a toxic spill in the city. After the trucks cause numerous deaths, the remaining survivors (two teens, their fathers, and another lady citizen) are forced to escape the truck stop. They find it's very difficult to out-smart the trucks.
