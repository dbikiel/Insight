The son of a German General becomes part of a mysterious conspiracy to gain hidden Nazi funds.
Noel Holcroft is a foreign-born American citizen working in New York City as an architect. In Geneva, he meets with a respected Swiss banker who tells him he has been designated to be executor of a huge four and a half billion dollar trust fund designed to make reparations for the war crimes of the Nazis. Holcroft's father, who committed suicide in 1945, was a key Hitler financial advisor, who became conscience-stricken about German war atrocities, turned against the FÃ¼hrer, and covertly diverted Nazi funds to a secret Swiss account. Under the terms of the covenant, Holcroft must locate the sons of his father's two associates so they can jointly activate their fathers' account. They battle the sinister forces seem to be trying to prevent them from signing the document, as it is believed that it will be used to establish a Fourth Reich.
In 1945, the children of the Third Reich were secretly hidden all over the world to be concealed until the 1970s, when they would come of age. Then the most elaborate plans and seven hundred eighty million dollars in a Swiss bank would be waiting. There would even be an unsuspecting outsider to set the plan into action. That outsider is Noel Holcroft, the American son of a high-ranking Nazi. He's just been shown an amazing document, "The Holcroft Covenant". If he signs, it will be his own death warrant and a devastating threat to the security of the world.
A man who was a confidant of Adolf Hitler dies and leaves a fortune to make amends for his Nazi past--but his son has to search the world to find it.
