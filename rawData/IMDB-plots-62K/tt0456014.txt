A rag-tag bunch of seniors, complete outsiders at their surf-crazed Laguna Beach High School, decide to crash the biggest team surf contest. In order to prevail, however, they must do one important thing...learn to surf! We're taking your classic Cinderella story into the world of surfing, complete with hi-jinx and the aesthetic beauty of surf mecca Costa Rica, our spectacular set location.
It's senior year at Laguna High, and senior trip is a surf safari to Costa Rica for the High school Surfing Championship (OK, we made it up). Of course, five senior outcasts, non-surfers all, aren't invited. It's OK, they've got the perfect underdog plan: 1. enroll in an offbeat Costa Rican surf school run by the ultimate burned-out surf bum; and 2. since they're low on dough, they'll stay at a commune run by two former 60s hippie radicals, Boris and Tillie (still wanted by the FBI). Throw in the soon-to-be-famous Three Swedes, Nordic beauties who get off on teasing American men, add a primate (Veronique the lovesick French chimp) and you have an epic teen comedy. And who knows, our outcasts may just surprise the surfing world in the process!
