Joe and Fay Wilson are a happily married vaudeville team. But when a reporter discovers, that one of the chorus girls in the troupe is a slightly eccentric heiress, who bugs sometimes out to do something strange (e.g. being a chorus girl in vaudeville), the manager decides that Joe had to do is act on Broadway -with the heiress- and the heiress falls in love with him, his marriage is threatened.
Joe Wilson is a small-time Burlesque performer in a troupe which is touring the stix playing to the hix, and his wife, Fay, is his stage partner. A madcap, runaway heiress, Claire Whitmore, joins the troupe on a whim. Then, along comes an advance man for a Broadway show, sees there is a good ticket-selling angle with Claire, and teams her with Joe (to carry the load) and all hands head for the Great White Way...except faithful Fay, who goes back to burlesque dancing. In the bright lights of New York City, Claire turns Joe every which way but loose, and Joe isn't resisting none too much.
