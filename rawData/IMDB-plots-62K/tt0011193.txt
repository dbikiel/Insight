Small town girl Ginger King ( Olive Thomas ) , attends a Eastern boarding school and yearns for a more glamorous life. Dissatisfied with her military school boyfriend, Bill Forbes, she meets the older Richard Channing and goes to a country club dance with him. More bold after that adventure, Ginger, while on her way home for a holiday, meets two crooks who entrust some stolen jewels to her for safekeeping. Ginger then puts the jewels on and appears in her home town dressed as a vamp. Once the crooks reappear, however, she realizes the seriousness of the situation and gives up her pretensions to return to Bill.
