This film was made as a kind of a "protest-song" against the panic fear of getting old and also against flirtation. The main character (played by Leos Suchar√≠pa) is an elderly man, admittedly competent, but not very responsible. In the continuous fear, he is trying to do as much as he can but, instead of confidence, he only finds out that in the real life one cannot just take but must give as well. Last but not least, one must be able to resign to his age.
