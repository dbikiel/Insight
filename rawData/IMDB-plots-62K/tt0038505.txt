To prevent a libel case against the paper, a reporter tries to compromise the reputation of a tycoon's slandered daughter.
The "Morning Star" is in trouble: J.B. Allenbury, rich and mighty, will sue them for 2 million dollars for an article which says that his daughter is chasing after married men. Reporter Bill Chandler is sent after Connie to prove that the story is actually true. The only problem is that he's not married....yet.
