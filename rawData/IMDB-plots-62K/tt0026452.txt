A loafer and a manicurist, both planning to marry money, meet and form an uneasy alliance.
Hotel manicurist Regi Allen is a cynical golddigger who meets her match in Theodore 'Ted' Drew III. After a date with Ted, she lets him sleep on her couch when he's too drunk to go further; but what is she to think when he wants to extend the arrangement?
Beautiful manicurist Reggie Allen has a plan to marry for money. One of her clients, paraplegic ex-aviator Allen Macklyn, is rich and has an eye for Reggie. However, things get a little crazy when Theodore Drew III enters her life. After losing his family fortune in the stock market crash, Ted looks to marry the daughter of a pineapple baron to keep life easy. Ted invites himself over for a prolonged stay at Reggie's and his wacky sense of humor wins her heart. Both must now decide between true love and money.
An ambitious manicurist and a penniless playboy make an agreement that both will marry for money, and love will not be a deciding factor. 'Regi" Allen, tired of her job in the barber shop of a snooty Manhattan hotel, meets Allan Macklyn, an invalid because of an injury in a recent airplane crash, and confides in him her desire to wed a "bankroll," regardless of love. She thinks her dreams have come true when she meets socialite-playboy Theodore "Ted" Drew. While night-clubbing, he misses his boat to Bermuda, and she puts him up for the night in her apartment. There, he confesses that it his fianc√©e that has money but he does not but his aim, like hers, is the same. She and Ted set up a little platonic light-housekeeping in her apartment, each to pursue their own goal. Later,just as their agreement and goals for each are about to materialize, they discover they have fallen in love...but with each other.
