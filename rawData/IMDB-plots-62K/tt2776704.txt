Jonathan is a middle-aged grounds keeper at a local theme park and suffers from a debilitating case of OCD. One day, his daily routine is disrupted by a surprise visitor in his basement: a beautiful young woman who, through a jarring turn of events, ends up dead. Jonathan panics and chooses not to report the dead girl. Instead, he invites her to dinner. Jonathan is happy to have a friend, until the police start closing in, and his mind, and the body of the girl, begins to decay.
Two teenage girls break in the house of Jonathan expecting to find marijuana in his greenhouse in the basement. However Jonathan returns from his work and surprises Katlyn that is in the top of a ladder. She startles, falls on the floor and dies. When her friend sees Katlyn dead, she believes Jonathan has killed Katlyn and runs to the street. She is hit by a car and also dies. Jonathan is a lonely obsessive, compulsive and psychotic man that collects keys and has cleaning compulsion. His mother also suffered from OCD and raised him with the same paranoia. His only friends are his neighbor that helps him at home and the security guard in the closed amusement park where he works as janitor. Jonathan does not report the incident to the police; instead, he decides to keep the beautiful Katlyn in the bathtub with ice and she becomes his girlfriend. He has dinner with her, baths her, until the day her body begins to decay. What will Jonathan do?
