Showing the entire height of this wonderful structure from the base of the dome and return, with the great Paris Exposition in the background, looking down Champs de Mars. A most realistic picture.
We see the base of the Eiffel Tower, with a crowd of people walking under it. Beyond, framed by the tower's arch, is the Palace of Electricity. It's the 1900 Paris Exposition. A few men stop to stare at the camera; then a woman turns and smiles. Slowly, the camera tilts and pans up the tower, nearly to the top, then slowly tilts back to street level. Men look at the camera. A man tips his hat, another smiles. A smiling young man approaches as if to do a flip in mid air. Someone shakes his hand.
