The shepherd Gombo lives with his wife, three children and grandmother in a tent on the Mongolian steppe. They are pleased with their rustic conditions, until a Russian truck driver, Serguei, gets stuck with his truck nearby. The cultural gap between Gombo and Serguie seems invincible. But maybe they can learn a few things from each other?
Gombo is a simple man who lives in the vast grassy fields of China with his wife, two children, and mother. The most interesting aspect of the film is the dragonfly Gombo and his son play with. The son is soon distracted by his mother, a city-girl, squeaking a little toy doll. He runs off and plays with his doll. Later in the film, the boy catches a dragonfly himself and amazes his mother and sister with the awesomeness of nature's toys.
