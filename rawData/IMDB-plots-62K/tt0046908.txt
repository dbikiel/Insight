Bugs Bunny finds the Tasmanian Devil in his encyclopedia just as the animal threatens to devour him.
All the animals in the forest, including animals one would not expect to find in the forest, are fleeing for their lives. Bugs Bunny manages to stop a turtle (by blocking its path with a shovel) and asks him what all the excitement is about. "The Tasmanian devil is on the loose!" cries the turtle. Bugs looks up "Tasmanian devil" in his encyclopedia and discovers that it's a "strong murderous beast" that eats just about any animal. It doesn't mention rabbits, and so the Tasmanian devil, who has been reading over Bugs's shoulder, pencils in "rabbits" himself. Bugs calmly asks, "What's up, doc?" He then spends the day tricking the wild, snorting, snarling beast with a bubble-gum chicken, a decoy deer, a giant slingshot and finally a classified ad in the Tasmanian Post-Dispatch.
