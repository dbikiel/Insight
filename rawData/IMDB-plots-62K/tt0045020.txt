A ordinary young American woman learns that she has become the owner of a tiny European country.
A tiny European country, which for years has survived financially only through evading its bills and smuggling, is finally facing bankruptcy, when a rich American agrees to save the place by buying it. But before, the deal is closed, he dies. His nearest relative and heir turns out to be a young woman with high ethical and democratic standards, but no experience with money, or affairs of state, or Europe. A charming young English visitor helps her to muddle through.
