The world of a young housewife is turned upside down when she has an affair with a free-spirited blouse salesman.
Summer, 1969: men on the moon, and Woodstock happening near the cabin where the Kantrowitz family stays every summer. The camp's a Jewish fish-bowl. Marty's there weekends; he repairs TVs in Brooklyn. He's square and decent. His wife Pearl and his mother camp with Alison (she's 14) and their younger son. Pearl got pregnant at 17 and feels she missed her youth. While Alison experiences her first date, first kiss, first period, and stealing off to Woodstock with the lifeguard, Pearl has her own sexual awakening with "the blouse man," a peddler who sells at the camp. They too go to Woodstock. Marty confronts Pearl about the affair; she and he have to decide what to do next.
It is the summer of 1969. Everyone seems to be waiting for Neil Armstrong to walk on the moon. The Vietnam War is going on, the flower children abound, and there is a big concert at Woodstock. Teenager Alison and her family are on vacation in a holiday camp for Jewish families not far from Woodstock. Pearl, the mother, is young and attractive, but defeated by life. She got pregnant at a young age and gave up on her dreams to devote herself to her children. Marty, the father, is absent because he is busy at the television repair company where he works. Everyone who needs to have their television repaired wants it in time to see the moon landing.One day a charming salesman of clothes and knick-knacks arrives at camp. Pearl falls in love at first sight. He lives an intense life of love and passion, ending with the adventure of going to Woodstock, where Alison and her first boyfriend have also gone. During the concert, the girl sees her mother and runs away. The father goes to the field and, having knowledge of her infidelity, tries to put back the pieces of a floundering marriage. Eventually, the salesman leaves and the parents dance together.
