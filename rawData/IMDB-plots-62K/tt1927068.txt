A young man entertains an unhealthy desire for his older and unstable half-sister.
In an incendiary story of love, desire, and betrayal between siblings; the rebellious eighteen-year-old Tadek returns to his half-sister Anka's home in search of solace and affection. Bound together by a painful shared family history, they must find a way to break free in order to survive. The feelings the young man entertains for his sister overreach socially accepted norms. Anka herself is somewhat emotionally unstable, floundering as she is in a less than joyous relationship with Andrzej, the leader of a local neo-Nazi group; she dreams of a better future. This formidable debut fearlessly yet tenderly explores one of society's last taboos.
