The year is 1999 and the storyline is actually a number of sub-plots all revolving around the 13-year old Clara, a girl that can predict the future and has telekinetic powers. The sub-plots include a boy in her class who has a crush on her, his family, her family and her principal that keeps talking French for some strange reason.
Based on a novel by Czech writers Pavel and Yelena Kohout. Clara is a 7th grade Russian emigre to this Negev town, and lives in a trailer on the edge of town. She is surrounded by some nutty Russian characters, many of whom are played by actors from Israel's Gesher Theatre Troupe. Clara will lose her powers to predict winning Lotto numbers if she falls in love, and then she meets the anarchist rebel hunk at Golda Meir High School.
