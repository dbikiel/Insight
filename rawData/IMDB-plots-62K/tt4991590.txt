A post modern theater adaptation of a classic Greek tragedy takes place in a central theater of Athens. Like every night, the audience take their seats and the play begins. Suddenly, the lights on stage go out. A group of young people, dressed in black and carrying guns, come up on stage. They apologize for the interruption and invite people from the audience to participate on stage. The audience is captivated by the ambivalence, still not realizing if this is part of the play or not. The play resumes with a main difference; life imitates art and not vice versa.
