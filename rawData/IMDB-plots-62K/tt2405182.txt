A fourteen-year-old boy in a stifling Helsinki slum takes some unwise life lessons from his soon-to-be-incarcerated older brother.
Concrete Night opens in a cramped, concrete-jungle home. The elder of the two brothers is getting ready to go and serve his prison sentence. During his last 24 hours of freedom, his little brother follows the brother he admires through the fateful sights of that night.
