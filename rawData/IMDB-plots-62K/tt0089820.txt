Two teenage summer camp counselors struggle with their younger campers, providing a variety of humorous situations and romantic encounters.
It's summer once again and kids flock from everywhere to go to Camp Pinewood in Clifton, Maine (originally filmed in Georgia). Dennis Baxter is the new camp counselor who has the hots for Rhonda, the new nurse. Timmy is the shy kid with no self esteem who takes every chance to run away; Tody is the overweight kid who wants to be a comedian; Brian is the poet; Bobby is the athletically gifted one; and Jerry is the slick talking, high dealing city boy from Philadelphia. The camp is lead by the fearless Big Irv.
A young and inexperienced camp counselor learns about life and love while at camp for the summer. There he falls in love with the camp nurse and teaches some life lessons to his group of campers during a camp tradition called Color Wars.
