Nine stories based on the true-life experiences of London Underground passengers.
Collective film comprised of nine stories taking place in and around underground transportation in London, all based on true facts submitted by readers of "Time Out" magazine: in "Mr. Cool" (Jenkins) a young female worker is courted by a colleague who travels by subway and an executive with his own car; in "Horny" (Hopkins), a girl gets sexually aroused every time she takes the subterranean; in "Grasshopper" (Huda), youngsters, police inspectors and drug pushers get mixed up in the subway; in "My Father the Liar" (Hoskins), a little boy takes the train with his father and witness an unexpected incident; in "Bone" (McGregor), a musician is in search of his Muse in the train cars; in "Mouth" (Iannucci), an attractive female passenger rides a noisy train compartment, as she gets sick; in "A Bird in the Hand" (Law), an old man experiences a sense of freedom helping a trapped bird; in "Rosebud" (Dellal), a mother desperately looks for her little daughter, while the girl has a good time; and in "Steal Away" (McDougall), two men steal a briefcase with money, but a ride in the subterranean makes them change their minds.
This Brit flick is set on the London underground. 9 different short stories, all different. Some real gems in here, also some big name Directors contributed, Jude Law, Bob Hoskins and Ewan Mcgregor have a go, and some cameo performances from big time actors like Ray Winstone and Daniela Nardini. A real underated but solid film.
