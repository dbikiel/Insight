An orphaned young woman becomes part of a puppet act and forms a relationship with the anti-social puppeteer.
Members of a circus troupe "adopt" Lili Daurier when she finds herself stranded in a strange town. The magician who first comes to her rescue already has romantic entanglements and thinks of her as a little girl. Who can she turn to but the puppets, singing to them her troubles, forgetting that there are puppeteers. A crowd gathers around Lili as she sings. The circus has a new act. She now has a job. Will she get her heart's desire?
Traveling with little more than her naïveté, sunny teenager Lili arrives in a new town and is befriended by a circus troupe. Though she becomes infatuated with the dashing magician, Marcus the Magnificent, Lili forms a more significant bond with puppeteer Paul and his four puppets, which she treats as real people. Together, Lili, Paul and the puppets prove to be a popular act, but their success and happiness are threatened by Paul's gruffness.
Lili, a poor French girl, has nowhere to go after her father dies. She meets Marc, and follows him home. "Home" turns out to be a carnival, where Marc is the magician, and Marc turns out to be romantically unavailable. The only friends Lili makes are the puppets in the puppet show. She does not like the carnival owner, but he is the puppeteer!
