When three tight friends Mole, Ratty, and Badger, find out that the infamous Mr. Toad of Toad Hall has been up to no good, they must find him and change his ways for good.
A mole, taken from the fever of spring, comes out of her den, starting a journey with a rat friend on the river and in the woods, where there is the den of the badger and where they spend the lethargy. When the wind blows again in the willows in spring, the three friends leave to change the frog for the better, that is very fickle.
