When her laptop stops working, Molly immediately takes it to a repair shop and thinks nothing of it when she gets it back in perfect working order. Soon after, she meets the charming and handsome Jack Newsom at her favorite restaurant. They share the same likes and dislikes, the same hobbies and are soon completing each other's sentences. Jack is perfect in every way until he slowly starts to exhibit a clingy, possessive side, which finally forces Molly to ask for some time apart. Suddenly, her bank accounts are being drained and half naked photos of her are being posted online. It turns out "Jack" is not who he says he is, and now that she's rejected him, he's her worst nightmare.
