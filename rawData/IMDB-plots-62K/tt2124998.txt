An expos√© on how the government has allowed U.S. corporations to avoid paying taxes and the growing wave of discontent that it has fostered.
We're Not Broke, co-directed by Karin Hayes and Victoria Bruce, explains how corporations have carefully rigged the US tax code through undue lobbyist influence on government officials, resulting in billions in tax breaks for bailed-out banks and big oil companies, and budget cuts for everyday Americans. We're Not Broke follows several activists who create a grassroots protest movement through social media called US Uncut. Commentary from government officials and experts on high finance is interwoven with footage of US Uncut activists taking to the streets in an effort to expose serial corporate tax avoiders like GE, Bank of America, Verizon, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and other major multinational corporations, months before the emergence of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Featured activists include underemployed college graduate Carl Gibson of Jackson, Mississippi, soccer mom and political activist Joanne Gifford of Napa, California, musician and graphic designer Chris Priest of Boston, grad student Bobbie Arrington of New Jersey, media analyst Ryan Clayton of Washington, DC, and small business owners like personal trainer Kira Elliott and HVAC specialist Jim Coleman, both of Chicago.
