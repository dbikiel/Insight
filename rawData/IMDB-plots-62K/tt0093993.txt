Feature-length, live-action musical version of the classic fairy tale by Charles Perrault.
An elf gives a queen a magic spell for the baby she always wanted. But an evil curse is placed over her daughter, Rosebud, which results in the king demanding that all the spindles in the kingdom be destroyed. As Rosebud grows into a naive yet pretty young woman, she wonders why no one in the kingdom ever has new cloth. She convinces her parents to go on a journey to a neighboring kingdom, not knowing what awaits her as soon as the king and queen are gone.
