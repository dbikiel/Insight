Jeffrey, a young gay man in New York, decides that sex is too much and decides to become celibate. He immediately meets the man of his dreams and must decide whether or not love is worth the danger of a boyfriend dying.
Jeffrey, a single gay Manhattan-based actor and waiter, loves sex. But the A.I.D.S. scare has made sex less fun in his multiple sex partner universe. As such, he decides to become chaste, believing that all his excess energy will be directed at other, just as important aspects of his life, like his career. His interior decorator friend Sterling believes what Jeffrey needs instead is a boyfriend and a life of monogamy to take the A.I.D.S. scare out of his life, much like Sterling has done with his life partner relationship with chorus boy, Darius, who is H.I.V. positive. But partly in viewing Sterling and Darius' lives, Jeffrey realizes that even more fearful to him than contracting A.I.D.S., is being in a relationship with someone with A.I.D.S. with whom he may fall in love, only to have that person die on him. After Jeffrey makes this chaste decision, he meets who would have been his next Mr. Right Now, if not THE Mr. Right in the form of Steve, who, in turn, sees Jeffrey as potential boyfriend material. What makes Jeffrey's decision about what to do about Steve is the fact that Steve too is H.I.V. positive. Partly in light of Steve, Jeffrey has to view critically his decision and how he will lead a fulfilling life as a gay man. In addition from Sterling and Darius, Jeffrey gets some professional and non-professional advice along the way.
