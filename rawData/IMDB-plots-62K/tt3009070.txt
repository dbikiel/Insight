A long hot summer in rural Norfolk and a rough coming of age for Goob Taylor, fighting with brutal, womanizing stock car racer Gene Womack for his mother's attention, and falling for the exotic charms of a pretty foreign field worker.
Young Goob, 16 years old, returns home to his mother where he grew up in the countryside, between a small restaurant and a field of pumpkins. His mother's new companion and Goob don't get along. This summer Goob will mature in many ways, dealing with a girl in the stock-car circuit, a gay cousin who dances, and problems with a seasonal woman fieldworker.
Were in the middle of a heatwave in Fenland, England. Goob Taylor has spent each of his sixteen summers helping his Mum run the transport cafe and harvest the surrounding pumpkin fields. When his Mum shacks up with swarthy stock car driving supremo and ladies man Gene Womack, Goob becomes an unwelcome side thought. However Goobs world turns when exotic pumpkin picker Eva arrives. Fuelled by her flirtatious comments, Goob dreams of better things.
