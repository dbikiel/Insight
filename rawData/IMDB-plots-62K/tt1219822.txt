A group of Porn Filmmakers are systematically attacked by 2 children on the set of a remote shoot.
Once upon a time ... Angie, an aging star reluctantly goes on one last shoot for a seedy Producer, on location, in an enchanting old cabin deep in the shadowy forest. While on the shoot the cast and crew encounter Henry, and his little sweet sister Patti, two strange and mysterious children who seem to live in the woods. A violent attack on the second evening of shooting sends Angie and the rest of the crew into a frighten frenzy. They lock themselves into their secluded cabin and find themselves trapped and surrounded by an unknown assailant. Could these two children be responsible for these vicious attacks?After witnessing a horrible slaying, Billy, the handsome lead, takes Patti hostage, as a means of gaining leverage against the unknown killer. This proves to be the fatal mistake as, one by one, the crew is horrifically slaughtered until only Patti, Angie, and Henry remain, resulting in a chilling final showdown between the three that ends in a terrifying conclusion. In this fairy tale of terror, the classic fable of, HANSEL &amp; GRETEL, is re-imagined into a visual enchantment of good and evil ... eat the candy, if you dare.
