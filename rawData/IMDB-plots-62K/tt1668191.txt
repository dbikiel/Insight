The lives of three homicide detectives are turned upside-down during a murder investigation.
Veteran homicide cop Ferman (Sener Sen) and his hot-headed partner Ydris (Cem Yilmaz) team up with rookie cop and anthropology major Hasan (Okan Yalabik) to investigate the murder of a young woman. The suspects include her conservative family, who might have killed her for honor, her drug-dealing boyfriend and aged billionaire Battal (Ã‡etin Tekindor) who had taken the victim as his second wife.
