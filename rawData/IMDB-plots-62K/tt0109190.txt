After three kidnappers lose the baby they have kidnapped, both the cops and kidnappers go looking for the baby.
Baby Bink couldn't ask for more; he has adoring (if somewhat sickly-sweet) parents, he lives in a huge mansion, and he's just about to appear in the social pages of the paper. Unfortunately, not everyone in the world is as nice as Baby Bink's parents; especially the three enterprising kidnappers who pretend to be photographers from the newspaper. Successfully kidnapping Baby Bink, they have a harder time keeping hold of the rascal, who not only keeps one step ahead of them, but seems to be more than a little bit smarter than the three bumbling criminals.
Posing as experienced baby photographers, the incompetent Mafioso, Eddie, and his equally maladroit sidekicks, Norby and Veeko, manage to snatch the adorable nine-month-old heir, Baby Bink, right under the noses of his mother, and his nanny. However, keeping the seemingly helpless hostage imprisoned is easier said than done, as Baby Bink proves to be more resourceful, and a lot more intelligent, than his desperate captors. Now, a frenzied hunt for the fugitive infant begins, against the backdrop of Chicago's bustling and dangerous streets. How will baby's exciting day out in the city finish?
