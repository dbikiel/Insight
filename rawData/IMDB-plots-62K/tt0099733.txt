The Evil Queen is dead and Snow White is on her way to see the 7 dwarves when Lord Maliss, the Queen's brother, sees her in the looking glass. He attacks her in the form of a dragon, taking Snow White's prince to the Realm of Doom. Enlisting the aid of the dwarves' cousins, Snow White must embark on a quest to save her true love.
This movie is similar to that of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." A young woman Lost in the woods comes across a cottage where 7 dwarfs live. These dwarfs each have a special gift, power of some sort. Mother Nature helps them in their journey to the castle to save the Prince.
