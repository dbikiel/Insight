In 'Saint' Nick Crosby's old-fashioned year-round Christmas village Santaville, working as an elf on Christmas preparations all year killed his daughter Holly's seasonal spirit. So she moved out, feeling neglected since her mother's death, to become a Boston toy firm's hardest-working sales executive. When Nick has a bad injury she returns to help out and finds Santaville outdated and near bankruptcy despite much generous help, especially from shy Peter. She tries to save it, counting on a plan proposed by charming financial advisor Ben Richards.
