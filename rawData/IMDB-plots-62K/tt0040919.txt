While conducting a symphony orchestra, Sir Alfred De Carter imagines three different ways of dealing with his wife's suspected infidelity, then tries acting out his fantasies, but things do not go as well in reality as they did in his imagination.
Haughty, acid-tongued symphony conductor Alfred De Carter (Sir Rex Harrison) is madly in love with his wife, Daphne (Linda Darnell), but is driven to a murderous fit of jealousy when he reads a private detective's report of her activities during his absence. Convinced she is having an affair with his handsome young secretary, Tony (Kurt Krueger), De Carter contemplates doing them both in. His fantasies of revenge inflate with elaborate, grisly detail in his mind as he conducts, but attempts to carry out his plans degenerate into a slapstick fiasco.
