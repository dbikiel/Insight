World War II drama that follows a group of British draftees, starting with their rigorous basic training, and ending with their deployment in North Africa.
A group of draftees are called up into the infantry during World War II. At first, they appear to be a hopeless bunch, but their Sergeant and Lieutenant have faith in them and mould them into a good team. When they go into action in North Africa, they realize what it's all about.
At the outset of World War II, a disparate group of civilians undergo basic training and prepare to fight for their country. The recruits include men from all classes, educations, and professions. At first, they object to their regimented lifestyle, and resent the constant supervision of their training Sergeant. Gradually, they learn their new skills and develop pride in what they are doing. Destined to be part of the invasion of French North Africa, their ship is nearly sunk. They soon find themselves fighting the Germans and putting their training to good use.
World War II is impending, but most Britons don't believe it. While a few, including petrol-pumper Jim Perry, are busily training for the new British Army. After Dunkirk, Lieutenant Perry finds himself training others, mostly recruits, who as yet don't take the war seriously. They soon learn that training under Lieutenant Perry and Sergeant Fletcher is serious business. Our platoon secretly embarks on an eventful voyage to North Africa, and contact with the enemy nears.
