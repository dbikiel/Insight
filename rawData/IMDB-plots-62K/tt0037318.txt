A lonely, mentally unbalanced woman invents a fictitious daughter and has the "daughter" write to a Marine stationed in the South Pacific. When the soldier returns back to the States, he goes to look up his pen pal, and is told by the "mother" that the daughter has moved away. An acquaintance of the women tells the soldier the truth, and in a rage the "mother" kills her. In order to cover up that crime, she realizes she must kill the soldier, too.
Sergeant John Meadows, a U. S. Marine paratrooper, returns to the U. S. to meet Rosemary Blake, a girl with whom he has fallen in love with only through correspondence. On the train, he meets Dr. Leslie Ross, also a talented musician, and he tells her about Rosemary. Rosemary's mother, a crippled and mysterious old lady, meets John and tells him her daughter has gone away for a brief time but will be returning soon. She shows him a portrait of her daughter. Mrs. Blake seems to have a strange power of her companion, Ivy Miller, and John feels uneasy in the Blake house and can not account for it. Mrs. Blake is very displeased when she learns that John and Leslie are acquainted, and goes into a rage when John tells her he has fallen in love with Leslie. John learns that the portrait of Rosemary was painted by his friend, Paul Arnheim of San Francisco; he leaves to talk to Arnheim and in his absence Mrs. Blake poisons HER companion, Miss Ivy, asserting she died from a sleeping potion administered by Leslie. What John learns in San Francisco, from HIS acquaintance, is startling, and Mrs. Blake realizes that he too must be murdered.
