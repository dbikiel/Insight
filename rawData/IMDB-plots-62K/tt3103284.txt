A daughter's life is sent into a tailspin when her mother falls victim to the charms of a seemingly innocent male friend with sinister intentions.
Soon after her father's death, college freshman Ariel learns her mother, Dana, has met Adam, a seemingly well-meaning and charming man at a grief support group. He claims to be a nurse, but the longer he hangs around the sicker and more isolated Dana becomes, even from Ariel. When Dana suddenly goes missing it's up to Ariel to discover the terrible truth of Adam's past before it is too late.
