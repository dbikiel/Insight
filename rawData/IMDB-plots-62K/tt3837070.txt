For many years Nina and Mark have been trying to have a child, including many unsuccessful attempts with IVF treatment. Adoption is not an option for them. They long for their own child, brought to life by their love for one another. Their seemingly last resort, still illegal in Germany, is a surrogate mother. For financial reasons, they choose India. Nina's fertilised ova are implanted in the womb of a young Indian woman. Everything goes well and Nina and Mark are anxiously awaiting the arrival of their baby when, out of the blue, they receive harrowing news. The surrogate mother has vanished. The German couple, against all odds, starts out on a search for the woman with their child in her belly.
