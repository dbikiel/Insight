After serving a year for a killing in self-defense, gunfighter Brock Mitchell tries to help his younger brother save his ranch but a crooked lawyer has other ideas.
A gunslinger attempts to hang up his hardware and help his younger brother raise cattle. The local attorney, whose brother the gunslinger shot in a fair fight, is determined to swindle the men out of their ranch by preventing a supply deal with the railroad, then using his bodyguard to bushwhack the younger brother.
Notorious former gunfighter Brock Mitchell has just finished serving a year in jail for a killing in self defense and finds that he's considered a pariah wherever he goes. He journeys home to Showdown Creek to help his younger brother save his cattle ranch from foreclosure by combining forces with other cattlemen to sign a contract to supply beef to an incoming railroad. Mitchell finds that his past reputation working against him as the town's sheriff saw the dead man as a competitor with Mithell for his daughter's affections. An even greater threat comes from the town's crooked lawyer who has recruited a ruthless hired gun as bodyguard to exact revenge for the death of his brother two years earlier.
