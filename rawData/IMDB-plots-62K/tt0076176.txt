After many years working abroad, Guido comes back to Milan. His dream is to set up a clock-shop but Italy is much changed while he was abroad. Robbery and bombs are daily events and to go out for a walk in the evening is risky. He succeeds however in setting up his shop only to see it destroyed by gangsters. But he meets a girl who calls herself Mia and he falls for her.
