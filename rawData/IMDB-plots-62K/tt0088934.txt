Emerald is an agent the Germans "have" inside allied intelligence 1944/WWII. With "help" from Emerald, the Germans catch Wheeler, believed to know the when and where of D-Day. Emerald is sent to be Wheeler's cell mate. Let the game begin.
In April 1944, an allied agent is sent to France in order to rescue an "overlord" captured by the Germans. (An "overlord" is one of the few men who know the date and place of the D-Day invasion). To achieve this goal, he will be supported by a secret friend of the Allies, a very important German officer and the French resistance. But the S.S. is not resting.
