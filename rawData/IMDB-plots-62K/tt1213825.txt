A newly separated father has to learn how to date again with help from his teenage son who himself dreams of conquering one girl's heart.
Ben Bingham has slipped into a fossilized middle-age, unlike his vibrant wife Amanda. When she finally leaves him, Ben is at a loss. He drowns himself in gin and refuses to get out of his pajamas until his popular 17 year-old son Justin takes over. He changes Ben's "look" and pushes him out into the social scene. Before Ben knows what is happening, he is the most popular single man in town, pursued by his nurse, his trainer, and karaoke-singing twins. Things change when Justin falls in love for the first time and now finds his father's lifestyle incredibly superficial. Ben is forced to refocus, recapture his humanity, his heart, and most importantly his wife... who is now with another man.

Before long, Ben becomes so popular that he is pursued by his nurse, his personal trainer, and karaoke-loving twin sisters. However, things quickly change when Justin finds himself in love. It is now Bens turn to teach his son the art of romance and in the process recapture his own wife's love.
