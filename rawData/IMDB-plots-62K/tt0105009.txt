A tough L.A. cop and the teen sister of the ballerina whose murder he's investigating become targeted by a sinister cult that secretly runs the city.
Detective Joe Garvey is called in to a mysterious case: a ballerina has been slayed on stage during a performance, it seems she didn't even fight. At her house Garvey finds her 14 years old precocious sister Tinsel. She's not very cooperative, so he arranges to have her sent to the orphanage -- until she's attacked too. He takes her under his wings, and soon both get the attention of a secret organization.
Four years ago, Los Angeles cop Joe Garvey was devastated when his wife and 9-year-old daughter were killed by a drunk driver. As a result, there is now an icy hole where Joe's heart used to be. Joe is assigned to investigate the murder of 24-year-old professional ballet dancer Pamela Hanley. Joe goes to Pamela's apartment, where he meets Pamela's 14-year-old sister Tinsel. Joe allows Tinsel to stay at his home for the time being, and Joe thinks Tinsel knows something about the murder. As Joe and Tinsel begin forming a bond, Joe starts returning to being the man he used to be -- a kind-hearted man. Tinsel tells Joe the location of a videotape that indicates that police chief Frank McCay has been running a group that kills killers who have been set free. Could McCay have anything to do with Pamela's death?
