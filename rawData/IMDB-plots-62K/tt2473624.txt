'Lawrence &amp; Holloman' is the dark and twisted story of a cynical and suicidal accounting clerk (Holloman) who gets taken under the wing of a happy-go-lucky, ever-optimistic suit salesman (Lawrence). Lawrence the optimist tries to teach Holloman the pessimist how to live happily and remain positive, until his own good luck starts to turn... Lawrence's fiance dumps him, his car is demolished, his dog goes missing, he loses his job, and his apartment is burned to the ground... and that's just the beginning! Is happiness determined by our outlook on life? Or can our destiny be changed... by another. Based on the hysterical and highly successful stage play by two-time Governor General Award-winning writer Morris Panych.
