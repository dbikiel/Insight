Lila is a dreamy girl who can't resign to accept reality as flat as she perceives it, hence she uses her imagination and her skills to modify it.
Armed with her sketchbook, Lila walks off to the world, convinced that she has the power to make it a better place. Sitting at a bar, hanging out at a park or walking down a street, Lila draws the lines that fill up the magic lost by those around her.
