"Bilocation" is a supernatural phenomenon in which an individual appears in two different places at the same time, which has been reported historically worldwide. What if your alter ego exceeds your experience and ability? And what if he/she tries to prevent you from standing in the way of him/her? Can you accept it, or will you kill the other "you"? Bilocation depicts the nightmare of an alter ego that endangers not only your identity but also your very existence. It is an imaginative psychological thriller unlike anything you've ever seen.
