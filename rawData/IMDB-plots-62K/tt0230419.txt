The current "aces" of billiards from different cities of Russia decided together to make a gift to their teachers, living out their days in almshouses. They decided to raise money and settle their former billiard mentors in a decent estate - a mansion with a plot, with decent service and food. Smolensk, St. Petersburg and Moscow billiard authorities have made their contribution to the "common fund". It was the turn to one of the regional authorities Savitsky. Initially, he did not want to participate in the common cause, but when he was shamed, he gave 20,000 "greens", but after the collectors sent killers. They decided that they had done their job, and the whole amount collected fell into Savitsky's hands. But the couriers were able to survive the attack and told everything. And then a cunning plan was developed .
