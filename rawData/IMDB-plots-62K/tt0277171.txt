The Turtles, a California rock band, tours England for the first time, meeting Frank Zappa, the Beatles and Jimi Hendrix.
Howard Kaylan, a singer for the rock band The Turtles, is about to marry his girlfriend and his band is traveling to England for the first time in the wake of the massive success of their hit single, "Happy Together", but fears that the band will not be well received in England. After the band's disastrous meeting with the Beatles, Kaylan has a life-changing dinner with guitarist Jimi Hendrix, whose band, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, is about to make their American debut, and Kaylan finds that Hendrix shares Kaylan's fears about his American debut.
This is the story of Howard Kaylan and his band, the
Turtles, as they explore the worlds of sex, drugs and rock and roll in the 1960's. Along the way, Howard meets the
Beatles, Jim Morrison, Frank Zappa, Brian Jones, Mama
Cass and a host of other pop luminaries; finds new and
hilarious ways to avoid the Draft Board and, ultilmately, ventures to swinging London to take on the Beatles and
sit through an amazing late-night repast with the legendary
Jimi Hendrix, himself. The colorful conclusion will never
be erased from your memory. This film embodies the true
spirit of sixties rock and the Summer of Love.
