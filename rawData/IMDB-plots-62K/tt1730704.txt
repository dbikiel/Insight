A group of nerdy college guys who can't seem to connect with girls their own age discover the excitement of hooking up with sexy older women.
Utterly disappointed by their relationship skills and the ongoing rejection from girls of their own age, a motley quartet of college slackers with raging hormones decide to set their sights on a relatively easier target: the typical sexy and more than willing to help, MILF. After all, mums do know best; however, when an overzealous member engages in a clandestine affair with an off-limits mother, lifelong friendships will be put to the test. Can the boys survive the betrayal?
