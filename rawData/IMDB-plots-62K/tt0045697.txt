A sheepdog thwarts the efforts of a thieving wolf whose tricks include altering the time clock, hiding in a bush, imitating Pan, digging a tunnel, unleashing a wildcat and disguising himself as the dog's coworker.
In this matchup of wolf and sheepdog, the sheepdog is identified as Ralph, and the wolf isn't named and doesn't punch the clock. The sheepdog is also not as good at anticipating the wolf's moves. But the wolf is, ultimately, no more successful; his Acme wildcat turns on him; his Tarzan-like vine swinging gets him only the sheepdog, no sheep, and the subsequent war of cutting down tree limbs, the tree, and ultimately the cliff where the tree grows, is done in by cartoon physics. Ultimately, he tries posing as Fred, the night shift dog, with no success.
In their first appearance in a Warner Bros. cartoon, Ralph Wolf and Sam Sheepdog punch the timeclock and begin their workday, with Sam foiling Ralph's attempts to steal a flock of sheep. Among Ralph's strategems: advancing the timeclock to confuse Sam, and posing as Pan, the forest god.
