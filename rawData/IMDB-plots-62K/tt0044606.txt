George Geef takes his son camping. His son thinks he sees lions everywhere; George can't see them even when they are right next to him. Lucky for George, his son's got his trusty pop-gun.
G.G. Geef (Goofy) takes his son on a camping excursion. All along the way, he boasts about all the great "adventures" he's been on. Meanwhile, his son is looking forward to encountering a lion which he does continually, even though Goofy often doesn't notice the lion. He does later that night though when the lion stows away in his sleeping bag and chases him. His son is able to fend off the lion with his pop gun. Finally, Goofy and son take off for a new campsite but Goofy still hasn't learned his lesson about spinning yarns ("Did I ever tell you about the time I was a race driver?").
