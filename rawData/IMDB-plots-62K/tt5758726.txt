John steals money and a bracelet/temporal dislocator from a Chinese antiques shop. Fleeing, he triggers the device and goes minutes back in time. The time travels result in new Johns and they form the Mega Time Squad.
A small-town crim finds an ancient Chinese time-travel device that can help him pull off a heist and start a new life-but he may not survive the consequences of tampering with time. The Castle meets Looper, Mega Time Squad is a study in high-meets-low, combining elements of the sci-fi, the crime thriller and the comedy to make a comedy heist film with a time-traveling twist.
