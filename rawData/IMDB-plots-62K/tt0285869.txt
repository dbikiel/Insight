Mia DuBois (Calhoun) is a walking clich√©--a successful therapist with an unsuccessful marriage. Her husband, Victor (St. John), is more interested in working on his laptop than on her. So she is very receptive to hearing about the wild sex life that her new client Tammy (Wilson) and Tammy's husband enjoyed, before he was murdered. Mia even accepts an invitation from Tammy to Pandora's Box, a no holds barred secret club of sex, drugs, and even more sex. She falls under the spell of a dark, handsome stranger named Hampton (White), a walking streak of sex. But is Hampton all he seems?
