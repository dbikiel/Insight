Casper decides to celebrate Christmas with the Jollimore family instead of doing his ghostly tasks.
Kibosh, supreme ruler of all ghosts, decrees that Casper must scare at least one person before Christmas Day. Casper then decides to visits Kriss, Massachusetts, where he meets the Jollimore family and sets out to complete his mission. As usual, kindhearted Casper has a ghastly time trying to scare anyone; so The Ghostly Trio, fed up with his goody-boo-shoes behavior, secretly hires Casper's look-alike cousin, Spooky, to do the job-with hilarious results.
