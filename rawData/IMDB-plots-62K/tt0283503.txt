Brooklyn, 1985. With the mob world as a backdrop, three life-long friends struggle with questions of love, loss and loyalty.
Michael 'Mike' Turner is handsome, bright, a resourceful law student and perfect gentleman. Mike were perfect hadn't he been born in late 20th century Brooklyn, a New York borough dominated by the mob, in his case Carmine Mancuso, who luckily chooses to protect bright Mike, even against mob ruffian Gino, and his two inseparable buddies. Cocky Carmine Mancuso actually chooses to join the bloody business, sparing only his youth friends. Third mate Bobby Canzoneri, whose equally dumb parents hosted the gang as kids, naively aims no higher then tenure in the US Post. Yet Bobby ends up dead when a mob war erupts.
The charming and slick Mike (Freddie Prinze, Jr) has his sights on Ivy league and law school; the cheap and lovable Bobby (Jerry Ferrara) wants to settle into life as a postal worker and married man; and the conceited and tough Carmine (Scott Caan) just wants to join the mafia. Friends since youth, the three boys grow up in the shadow of NY mafia in the 1980s. When the Gambino family gets shaken up and the violent fallout from the mafia shake-up flips their lives upside down, the friendship is tested and strengthened through tragedy. It's a coming of age story for three young males in 1980s Brooklyn.
