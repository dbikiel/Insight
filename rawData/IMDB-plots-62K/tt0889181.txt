Out of gas on a dark country road and forced to seek help at a farmhouse, five teenagers on their way to a rock concert step into a nightmare as they're hunted by a twisted killer with an ax.
One dark and stormy night, some friends wander their way up to the video store. Upon walking around aimlessly, trying to find the perfect title, they come across what appears to be a guilty pleasure of a film: a cheesy horror film that is bound to have a great amount of nudity and gore. Something for everyone, if you will. After all of the friends seemed to be in agreement that this film at the very least promised an entertaining time, they rented the film and went home . When inserting the DVD, the group of friends discovered something far more horrifying than the film Dark Fields (2006) . . . they had actually paid $4 dollars to see what is seriously one of the worst films ever. Nudity and gore ensue after the group of friends get into a violent argument over the film, then settle things with a massive orgy. (In the version for video stores in Michigan, the friends didn't rent the film, instead they watched it for free on Cable, but still got pissed).
