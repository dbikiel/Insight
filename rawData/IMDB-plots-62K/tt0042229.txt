Master swindler James Reavis painstakingly spends years forging documents and land grants that will make his wife and him undisputed owners of the entire state of Arizona.
The U.S. government recognizes land grants made when the West was under Spanish rule. This inspires James Reavis to forge a chain of historical evidence that makes a foundling girl the Baroness of Arizona. Reavis marries the girl and presses his claim to the entire Arizona territory.
Master swindler James Reavis devotes years to forging documents that will give him claim to the entire state of Arizona. He finds a young girl whom he believes is an orphan and hires a governess to educate her in the manner of the Spanish aristocracy. He invents deceased parents for her whose ancestry can be traced to a mythical Spanish nobleman. He then insinuates himself into a Spanish monastery for three years so he can access its biblioteca which carries the records of Spanish land grants.
