In the 1830s, a captain in the East India Company lobbies to investigate the criminal Thugee Cult of Kali, an organized crime group of stranglers and thieves.
A murderous religious cult is way-laying travellers and stealing goods in nineteenth century India. As the disappearances mount and trade becomes difficult, the British East India Company is forced to act. But they give the job to an upper-class officer completely out-of-touch with the country rather than the obvious candidate who has been in India for years and well understands the people and culture.
In the 1820s, in Indian, the British East India Company territory is menaced by the unexplained disappearance of thousands of travelers each year. Captain Lewis, a company officer, unearths a fantastic religious cult - Thuggees - who worship Kali, Goddess of destruction; they murder their victims with a silk cloth, rob them and intern the bodies in mass graves. Lewis, after some inter-office politics, is put in charge of suppressing the Thuggees.
