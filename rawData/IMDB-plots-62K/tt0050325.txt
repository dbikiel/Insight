After the Civil War, a Confederate veteran must track down five outlaws who murdered his father and ransacked his farm during the war.
Domino returns from the Civil War to find his ranch in ruins and his father murdered. Five men were responsible and four were identified. One by one Domino outdraws the four that were known, all being outlaws. There is only one left now. Domino does not know his identity but that man probably knows of Domino and his mission.
