An object is found that points to the secret of eternal youth so a research team is sent to find the fountain only to find it is protected by a giant snake

This leads to a second expedition to discover the reason behind his longevity, but there's a major problem in the form of an Amazonian tribe that guards the proverbial fountain of youth and the giant, five-headed snake they worship.
