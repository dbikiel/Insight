Small rocks fall from the sky which, when touched, trigger a latent virus that has always existed in humans and begins mutating them into an alien species. Taking advantage of its hive mentality, the aliens are absolutely dedicated to transforming every human on Earth and do so with alarming swiftness. Only a small group of humans remain who have the medical knowledge to devise antibodies to reverse the effects of the virus.
Aliens seize human bodies by infiltrating them with what appears like sparkling cosmic dust in this "Invaders Of The Body Snatchers"-like update without the suspense or logic.
