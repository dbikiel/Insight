Children are able to communicate and control fantastic creatures, but they are unknowingly being used in an evil plan to collect negative energy.
In Japan, the small Masashi moves from one evacuation center to a small town. There you will discover that every child has the right to communicate with a fantastic creature, but these are being used in an evil plan to collect negative energy of children.
The directorial debut from accalimed artist Takashi Murakami, Jellyfish Eyes brings its creator's endless imagination to the screen in a tale of family, friendship, and loyalty set in a world of fantasy that only Murakami could conjure. Having moved to the country with his mother following the death of his father, young Masashi (Takuto Sueoka) immediately makes a most unlikely friend: a flying, jellyfish-like sprite that he nicknames Kurage-bo. Taking Kurage-bo under his wing and into the classroom, Masashi soon discovers that his schoolmates have similar friends - and that they, their creators, and the town itself are not all they seem to be. Pointedly set in a post-Fukushima world, Murakami's film carries a message of cooperation and hope while boasting unforgettable creature designs and handmade special effects nearly a decade in the making. A touching triumph of creativity and wonder, Jellyfish Eyes is a must-see for film lovers of all ages.
