Mario Suarez is a forty-something tango artist, whose wife Laura has left him. He leaves his apartment and starts preparing a film about tango.
Set in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the film tells the story of director Mario Suarez's quest to make the ultimate tango film. Lonely after his wife (one of the film's stars) has left him, Mario must find the themes that will hold the film together, while simultaneously permitting his musicians and dancers the freedom of expression that is necessary to satisfy the tango-hungry Argentine audience. Things become complicated when Mario falls in love with Elena, a beautiful and talented young dancer who is the girlfriend of the powerful and dangerous Angelo Larroca, an investor in the picture. And Mario's creative vision is challenged by his investors when he plans a scene that recreates Argentina's dark years of political suppression and "disappearances".
In Buenos Aires, the director Mario Suarez is developing and rehearsing a tango play with historical events as background. Mario misses his mate Laura Fuentes, who has recently left him, and is recovering from a car crash with an injured leg. When the major investor Angelo Larroca asks for an audition for his lover Elena Flores, she succeeds and participates in the play; however, Mario falls in love for her and Elena fears the dangerous Angelo.
