A neighborhood good-for-nothing attempts to romance the new girl in town.
Kathir (Ravi Krishna) is a young underachiever, frequently venting his frustrations through public outbursts. When a north Indian girl Anitha (Sonia Agarwal) moves into his neighborhood, he falls head over heels in love with her, and aggressively expresses interest. When she does not respond favorably, things get out of hand.
