Three Colorado girls decide to hop on their motorcycles and head to California. On the way they get mixed up in drugs, rape and stolen motorcycles.
Three teenage girls run away from home because they have become jaded by their lives, and their dream is to see the ocean in California. Along the way they face getting drugged, raped and attacked by outlaw bikers. They finally make it to the beach and the peeping-tom pervert from the opening scene blows them away with a shotgun. Then their ghosts dance together in the surf. This movie not only illustrates some of the bad things that can happen to youth on the road, it also shows that no matter how much you travel, no matter how street-wise you become, you don't even have to leave home to be victimized. Their death followed them halfway across the country from their hometown. It was a very sad ending, and the silence as they died made it very surreal, adding to the effect. Watching this movie will produce many mixed emotions.
