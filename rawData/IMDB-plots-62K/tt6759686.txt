Mater is a film about the struggle between love and law; about social differences and distances that these generate. And about love, that crosses all, allows all: both good and evil.
Lena and Celeste love each other and desperately want to become mothers. One night, they go out looking for a sperm donor and choose a stranger to conceive their child with. That night Celeste meets Dar√≠o, a young man unhappy with his life and dominated by his overprotective mother. The event will set their lives on a different course, especially Dario's, who will discover that he can do something for himself. Based on the play "Wind in a violin" by Claudio Tolcachir.
