What is stranger than the big hole that opens up in Lucy Sherrington's living room floor? As it turns out, love.
A young, pretty art teacher, Lucy (adored by every male in her small home town), attempts to embark on an affair with her co-worker, married high-school football coach, Clint. Before it can eventuate he is sucked into a bottomless, zero-gravity hole in her living room floor. One by one all town members come to inspect, theorize about and try to remove Clint from the hole, and in doing so learn about his disloyalty to his wife. The movie is a bit like Being John Malkovich in its metaphysical satire.
