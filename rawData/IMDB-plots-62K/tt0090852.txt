An obsessively punctual comprehensive school headmaster sets out to give an important speech at the annual Headmasters' Conference.
Brian Stimpson (John Cleese) is the headmaster of a comprehensive (high) school in England. He sets himself, his staff, and pupils very high standards. On the way to a conference at which he is to talk, all manner of disasters strike.
Fastidious time-keeper headmaster Brian Stimpson (John Cleese) allows plenty of time for his train journey to a Headmasters' Conference, but unfortunately he gets on the wrong train and misses his connection. As a result, he commandeers a car driven by sixth former Laura (Sharon Maiden) to take him there. They are pursued by Stimpson's wife Gwenda (Alison Steadman) who, while taking three old ladies out for a drive, is mystified at seeing her husband with a young girl and gives suspicious chase. On the way, Stimpson encounters old flame Pat (Dame Penelope Wilton), who is also dragged into helping him beat his deadline. But when the car is destroyed, he and Laura have to rob a salesman of his vehicle. Stimpson eventually arrives at the conference in a bedraggled state, followed by his wife and her charges and the Police, who arrest him for car theft.
