After reading his favorite Dick Tracy comic, Daffy Duck has a surreal dream in which he is Duck Twacy, a private eye on the trail of an army of horrifyingly grotesque villains who stole every piggy bank in town, including his own.
While reading his favorite comic book, Daffy accidentally knocks himself unconscious and dreams he's Duck Twacy, famous detective, trying to solve the case of the missing piggy banks. Taking a streetcar (conducted by Porky Pig, in a non-speaking cameo role) to the gangsters' hideout, he meets up with such grotesque criminals as Pickle Puss, Eighty-Eight Teeth and Neon Noodle.
