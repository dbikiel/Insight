A duel between a suspected murderer and a detective pressed by people who want results. But whose skin is really wanted.
A modest man is suddenly seized from his apartment and interrogated by the police for what initially is presented as involving a stolen car, but it's slowly revealed to involve a serial killing. Meanwhile Internal Affairs is investigating the manner in which the investigating officers work.
At 5 o'clock in the morning, the police blasted their way into Eddie's apartment and took him to the police headquarters. He's sitting in an interrogation room opposite detective John Steele who frequently interrupts the interview letting Eddie sweat until he comes back. He's suspected of car theft and even murder. But he isn't the only one under pressure, the detective himself has people on his back with other agendas.
