Young woman wants to become the next big singer with the help of her friends and despite the wishes of her working class family.
Teenage cousins Jackie Mullens (Jo Kennedy) and Angus (Ross O'Donovan) live in the Harbour View Hotel, a pub owned by Jackie's family and located in The Rocks area of Sydney, underneath the Sydney Harbour Bridge. 18 year old Jackie dreams about becoming a singing star, and 14 year old Angus, who writes songs and skips school, thinks that he has what it takes to be a successful manager.Angus dreams up several schemes in an attempt to get Jackie noticed, including getting her a spot at one of Sydney's happening clubs, where she has to wear a kangaroo suit, but they all fail to win Jackie any paying gigs. Angus then enters Jackie in a national talent contest that is happening at the Sydney Opera House on New Year's Eve. A win in the contest will give Jackie some assurance about her career, and the competition's grand prize of $25,000 will be enough for her family to keep their pub open, stopping the local brewery from repossessing it.
