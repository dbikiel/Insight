A butler and the staff of an eccentric aged philanthropist whose family wealth is exhausted engage in larceny and crimes to maintain her lifestyle and provide funds for her charitable activities.
When Miss Vicki's father dies she continues with her charitable donations. Unfortunately, the family wealth is depleted and she is flat broke. Her loyal butler, Claude Fitzwilliam, known as Fitzwilly, leads the household staff to steal from various businesses by misrepresenting themselves, charging goods to other wealthy people and misdirecting the goods shipments, all to maintain Miss Vicki's standard of living and her philanthropy. With Fitzwilly's encouragement, Miss Vicki is writing a "Dictionary for Dopes" which contains all possible phonetic spellings of a word, and gives the reader the correct one, and for that she needs a secretary. Juliet is hired and she is suspicious and she discovers what is going on while at the same time falling in love with Fitzwilly. Juliet agrees to allow Fitzwilly to carry out one more big caper before they get married that will keep Miss Vicki comfortable for the rest of her days.
