The film tells the story of the Prussian family von Krauss living in the Puck area, as well as the love between the Kashubian boy Mateusz and the German aristocrat Marita and is set between 1900 and 1945. The script depicts the complicated fate of three nations inhabiting the former Polish-German borderland in northern Kashubia, where the line of the border in Versailles after the First World War divided not only the land but also the people of Germans, Kashubs, and Poles, causing riots and often hatred. The script goes through four decades showing the complex attitudes and choices that people have to make here. Prussian anti-Polishism fought with Kashubian patriotism, which in 1939 ended in mass murder committed in thousands of Kaszubians in forests near Piasnica.
