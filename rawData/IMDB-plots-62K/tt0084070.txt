An outrageous, affectionate look at coming of age in the Eisenhower era in Brooklyn.
A middle-aged woman meets a strange man on the streets at night who shows her the remains of a leather jacket. He takes her back to Brooklyn of 1953, and tells her about Vinnie, his gang, the Stompers, his girl Roz, his friend Crazy Shapiro, and the all-out rumble with the black rival gang, the Chaplins.
