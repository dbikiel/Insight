Modeling furs has given our heroine Cookie a taste for them, so she's determined to marry a rich man. Scheduled to meet a male model aboard a yacht, she meets the yacht's rich owner Dick Smith instead; he welcomes the confusion of identity and sets out to win her by force of personality alone. It's an uphill battle. Lots of wry repartee.
