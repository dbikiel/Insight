Four neighborhood friends in modern-day Zagreb struggle to get along as their relationships are plagued by alcohol, drugs, hooliganism, crime and their country's past.
Eliciting images of cancer, this drama explores the illnesses that plague modern Croatia. Four young junkies in Zagreb maturing in the wake of war reflect the petty hatreds, violence, prejudices and mood hanging over the country like a disease that spreads with no cure in sight.
