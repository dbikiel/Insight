"All Over The Guy" is a contemporary romantic comedy about the quest to find the "one" when "the one" doesn't know he's the "one." It explores the unlikely pairing of two 20-somethings thrown together by their respective best friends in hopes of igniting their own romance. They do everything they can to NOT fall in love, but finally they overcome the dysfunction of their parents and surrender to their hearts.
Eli and Tom are successfully featured in this movie as two meant-to-be lovers. The movie is mostly flashbacks recounting the moments where each of the individuals' friends take turns to pair them up. Tom having emotionally-distant alcoholic parents and Eli hailing from a pair of Jewish psychiatric who taught him to be emotionally open, making him neurotic, couldn't make the two further apart. Surprisingly or fortunately, despite the two different guys, the two individually believe in finding the one and it takes a blind date from Jackie and Brett who believe in their match. An interesting match-up between the two, from two very different backgrounds will keep you glued especially with the touch of comedy, the sarcasm of the two and their involved friends.
