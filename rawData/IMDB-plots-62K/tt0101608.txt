The Cold War is over, but the battle is still blazing as Russia and America join forces. When a ruthless international drug cartel threatens to impose a new world order of its own, aggressive no-nonsense CIA chief Rob Reed, calls an emergency summit with his KGB counterpart. With lightning speed, Red Army Spetnatz commandos and the elite U.S. Delta Force are dispatched into action. But as the cartel's terrorist army continues its march across international borders, it's up to Green Beret veteran Rick Burns to forge the Americans and Soviets into a fighting machine before time runs out. From the jungles of Colombia to the heart of Red Square, two former enemies join forces under one common cause when survival means they must become comrades in arms.
