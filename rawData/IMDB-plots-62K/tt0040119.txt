Insurance investigator Dan Sullivan is forced to pose as a doctor while investigating a huge payroll robbery.
A gang of ex-convicts pull and holdup in an office building and the night-watchman is killed. The leader of the gang is wounded and they take refuge in a lodge belonging to the leader's wife. An insurance investigator registers at the lodge, posing as a doctor, and he is forced to operate on the wounded gang-leader. He recovers but is later murdered by a deaf-mute that works at the lodge. In the gunfight that follows, the investigator and the slain man's wife succeed in capturing the gang.
