A driver named Raju embarks on an extraordinary journey of redemption by forever changing lives of 3 people due to a controversial hit and run accident.
Raju Bhambhani (Pratik Gandhi) is a young man from Ahmedabad. His life changes for worse when his boss and son of a famous industrialist, Tanmay (Kavi Shastri) accuses him for a hit and run case. As Raju sets out to prove his innocence, police tries to set facts asunder from fiction.
Raju Ambani, a driver by day and bootlegger by night, is a simple and charming guy who dreams of opening up his own travel agency someday. He falls in love with Shaily Asher, a French girl who has come down to Ahmedabad at the behest of her friend Tanmay Shah. Life was seemingly perfect for Raju till he finds himself unwillingly stuck in a hit and run situation involving Tanmay, who happens to be the son of an affluent lawyer, Mr. Amitabh Shah.
