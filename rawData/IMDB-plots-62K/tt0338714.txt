Angst is the story of a sensitive stage director, Robert, and his beautiful girlfriend Marie, a doctor in a children's clinic. Their different attitudes toward life lead the two to constant fights and conflicts. When Robert finds out that his father is terminally ill, he feels guilty for not having taken more care of him. Marie tries to help, but when his father dies, Robert falls into a downward spiral of despair. He looks for solace in his work and in one-night stands with prostitutes. When Marie finds out that Robert has betrayed her, she leaves him. However, her love for Robert and her realization that to love someone also means one must be able to forgive, offer hope for a new beginning between the two.
