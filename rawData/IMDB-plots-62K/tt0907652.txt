Kimihiko Onizuka (Sadao Abe) is a salaryman infatuated with Maiko (apprentice geisha) and whose greatest goal in life is to play a party game called "yakyuken" with one. Upon being transferred to his company's Kyoto branch, he dumps his coworker girlfriend Fujiko Osawa (Kou Shibasaki) and makes his first ever visit to a geisha house. However, when the realization of Kimihiko's lifelong dream is rudely interrupted by a professional baseball star named Kiichiro Naito (Shinichi Tsutsumi), he vows revenge by becoming a pro baseball player himself. Meanwhile, Fujiko decides to become an apprentice geisha. A success war between Kimihiko and Naito ensues where they try to out-do each other by subsequently becoming professional baseball players, K-1 fighters, chefs, actors and even politicians.
