Jean is young, gay, and promiscuous. Only after he meets one or two women, including Laura does he come to realize his bisexuality. Jean has to overcome a personal crisis (he is HIV-positive) and a tough choice between Laura and his male lover Samy.
Jean is a bisexual, sexually active man, who learns he's HIV+. The movie is about him coping with the disease, with his new and violent love with the young and very passionate Laura, his desire for Samy, and his appetite for sexual diversity.
