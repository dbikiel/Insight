The manager of a service agency for the wealthy clashes with - and falls for - an inventor who is seeking funding for a new kind of tractor.
Glamorous and efficient Helen Murphy runs a service that will provide any type of assistance to wealthy customers, but what she's really looking for is a man who can take care of himself. Rugged Robert Wade, an inventor in town to secure funding for his new model tractor, wants to meet a woman who won't try to run his life. Despite being made for each other, Helen and Bob go through the usual complications of a film like this before ending up together in the final reel.
