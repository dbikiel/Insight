A frustrated young man, separated from his younger girlfriend, gets involved in a juvenile gang.
Scotty White (age 19) must stop 'going steady' with Janice Wilson (age 16) when Janice's parents intervene. Frustrated, idle and without Janice's restraining influence, Scotty encounters Cholly and his band of disorganized, fun-loving delinquents. Soon he has Janice (who seems considerably the more mature of the two) mixed up in their doings, which begin to seem less and less like harmless fun...
High school senior Scotty White is a good kid. His mother worries about the influence of a local gang of trouble makers, they who cause a ruckus where ever they go, but his father trusts him to do the right thing if confronted by the gang. Scotty becomes despondent when the parents of his sixteen year old girlfriend Janice Wilson forbid the two from seeing each other. Mr. &amp; Mrs. Wilson like Scotty but they feel Scotty and Janice are far too serious about each other than they should be at their tender ages. Out alone one evening, Scotty gets caught up with the gang when they help him out of an altercation where he was an innocent bystander. What Scotty does not know is that they were the initiators of that altercation. The gang is led by Cholly and Eddy, both thugs with a violent and sadistic streak. Eddy doesn't much like Scotty and does whatever he can to implicate Scotty in whatever wrongdoing. When things start to get out of hand with Cholly and Eddy, Scotty has to do something to get his life back while protecting Janice.
