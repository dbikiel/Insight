Plagued by revolutionaries that harass his plantation in a banana republic, fruit company exec Steve Case rehires former nemesis Nick Butler to restore order and profits.
Banana Company executive Steve Case on a Caribbean plantation group tries to convince his former co-worker Nick Butler to take over the plantation No 7. But he is on his way to Chicago, to take over a job as a manager for another company himself. He has also troubles with US night-club singer Lee Donley, whom he wants aboard a ship back to the US, and rebel Rosario. He is able to get Nick to the plantation, but is he able to keep him there or will he leave it in a few days with Gloria, the wife of the former executive of No 7, Mr. Anderson ?
Tough guy Nick Butler, inveigled by fast-talking Steve Case to ramrod his company's fruit harvesting outfit in Central America, and earthy Lee Donley, thrown by circumstances into the same camp, can't quite figure out whether they love each other or not. An unfaithful wife, an escaped guerilla and a visit by Case help the on-again-off-again pair to make up their minds.
