A girl, her uncle and a friend start an emotional travel to recover a family tree.
Alma is a young girl with emotional problems and a special relationship with her grandfather Ram처n, an old country man who stopped talking about 12 years ago after his son, Alma's father, sold a 2000-years-old olive tree in order to open a restaurant. Dominated by the sadness and the melancholia by the loss of his most beloved tree, Ramon spends his days visiting the place where the olive tree was planted, hoping the day the tree returns. Unable to bear the situation any longer, Alma looking for the olive tree, discovering that it was acquired by a Germany's energy company located in Dusseldorf. Without money or resources, Alma convinces her uncle Alcachofa and her friend Rafa (who has a love interest for her) to go in a truck from Spain to Germany to recover the tree, starting a travel with unexpected consequences for everyone...
The impulsive and spirited twenty-year-old poultry farmer, Alma, has always shared a deep and empathetic bond with her beloved grandfather and olive tree cultivator, Ram처n. Once encircled by a centuries-old grove in the sun-drenched Castell처n province, Alma's financially hard-pressed family has abandoned the olive oil production for an uncertain future in tourism business--and what is more heartbreaking--the estate's most cherished ancient olive tree had to be sold off to stay afloat. Under those circumstances and with her grandfather drifting into dementia, Alma embarks on an almost quixotic mission to retrieve the ancestral tree, driving all the way up to cold D체sseldorf on a borrowed flatbed truck, without a plan or money. Will Alma let go so easily what shaped her identity?
