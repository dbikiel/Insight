A police profiler has just returned from psychiatric leave only to find that he is caught up in a serial killer's rampage. Fighting to keep buried the trauma of his childhood, he must confront the all too-familiar flesh masks that the killer leaves on the faces of his victims. He must face his own demons along with the killer to save his small eroding existence.
Despite a traumatic past (suicide of mother, father drank himself to death) and battling a drinking problem, Russell Spivey (Mark Thompson) is a successful police profiler. When he rejoins his team after a stint on psychiatric leave and finds himself on the trail of a serial killer, he must set aside his personal issues and do what he does best - delve into the mind of a murderer. But as Russell gets closer to solving the case, it appears that the killer is now targeting him. Each victim is found with a mask - an all-too-familiar object of his childhood - and word games that leave him puzzled. Russell must face own demons in order to solve his most difficult case.
