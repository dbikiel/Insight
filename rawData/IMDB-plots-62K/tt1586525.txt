What seems to be a chance encounter one day at a coffee shop leads to a full-fledged romance, but the couple must fight for their relationship to survive the craziness that is show business.
A dual-perspective he-said she-said romantic comedy about two 20-somethings' chance meeting at an LA coffee shop, that takes us on a roller coaster ride as they attempt to find one another and find true love within the superficial LA singles scene.
