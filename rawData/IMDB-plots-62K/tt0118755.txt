A secret family of four-inch people living inside the walls of a house must save their home from an evil real estate developer.
The Borrowers are four-inch high "little people" who live under the floorboards. When the owner of the house they live in dies and her evil lawyer Ocious P. Potter wants to destroy the house to build luxury apartments in its place, they start to fight him with the help of the son of house owner, Pete.
The four-inch-tall Clock family secretly share a house with the normal-sized Lender family, "borrowing" such items as thread, safety pins, batteries and scraps of food. However, their peaceful co-existence is disturbed when evil lawyer Ocious P. Potter steals the will granting title to the house, which he plans to demolish in order to build apartments. The Lenders are forced to move, and the Clocks face the risk of being exposed to the normal-sized world.
