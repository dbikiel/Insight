The tiny village in the far north of Sweden called Ensamheten (Solitude) has sixteen inhabitants. They all share an unusual passion - armwrestling. Among them is 22-year-old Heidi Andersson, three times a world champion. Here is a varied life. One day in the forest with the other lumberjacks, the next she is in the big city modelling bridal gowns. She hunts moose with her mother and talks about boys with her father. The village is a cooperative and they are all behind this slender woman as she takes on the world.
