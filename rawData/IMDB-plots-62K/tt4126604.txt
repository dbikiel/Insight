The gift wrapper of a department store works after hours to serve a stage magician.
Kind, lithe--and above all--a conscientious professional, Wondermart's elegant gift wrapper, Miss Anderson, is an expert at crisp creases, intricate folds, and curly bows. With only five minutes before closing, Miss Anderson receives the shift's last customer, the soft-spoken and masterful illusionist, Mr Grimm, unbeknownst to her, however, that she is about to witness the most spectacular private magic show ever. What would be the perfect gift for a perfect gift wrapper?
