Young Queen Margot finds herself trapped in an arranged marriage amidst a religious war between Catholics and Protestants. She hopes to escape with a new lover, but finds herself imprisoned by her powerful and ruthless family.
The night of August 24, 1572, is known as the Massacre of St. Bartholomew. In France a religious war is raging. In order to impose peace a forced wedding is arranged between Margot de Valois, sister of the immature Catholic King Charles IX, and the Hugenot King Henri of Navarre. Catherine of Medici maintains her behind-the-scenes power by ordering assaults, poisonings, and instigations to incest.
Catherine de MÃ©dicis, the power behind the Catholic throne of her son Charles IX, arranges an apparently peace-making marriage between her unwilling daughter Margot and the Protestant Henri de Navarre. The wedding soon turns into a massacre of the visiting Protestants and Henri's life is only saved by Margot's intercession. As intrigue, murder and adulterous relationships multiply in the Court a strange but strong loyalty emerges between the apparently ill-matched couple.
