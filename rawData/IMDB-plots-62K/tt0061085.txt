It's a great film and you could write a thesis about why two working class lads from the North of England share the money - Eric wins it, Ernie takes it - but that's showbusiness.
After a mix-up with a member of the Royal Family, traffic wardens Eric and Ernie decide to take a holiday to the South Of France. However, when they arrive there, they find themselves caught up in the plot of Le Pirate who has stolen a collection of valuable jewels and plans to use Eric and Ernie to smuggle the collection out of France. He lures them to an old villa filled with traps and uses Claudette, another member of the gang, to keep Eric and Ernie busy. However, other jewel thieves are after the jewels and Eric continues to find their bodies in the villa just before it disappears. However, while they fight over the love of Claudette, Eric and Ernie begin to wonder just what is going on, and begin to investigate. As to Claudette, whose side is she on...?
