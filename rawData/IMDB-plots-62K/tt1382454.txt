It's night; a wide-eyed fearful child is in bed. When her granny enters the room, the child pretends to be asleep. Granny O'Grimm isn't fooled; she pokes the child with a walker and picks up the book "Sleeping Beauty." We see the story as she tells it, images jumping between fairies at a baby's christening and Granny's agitated narrating. The aged fairy, who wasn't invited to the feast, looks just like Granny, but with small wings. As the child's terror deepens, Granny reaches the end of her version of the story. Will the child get any sleep?
