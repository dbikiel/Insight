Domestic is a story about people who eat the animals they love and animals who love people unconditionally. A rabbit, a hen, a cat, a dog and a dove pass through the lives of the main characters and influence their evolution.
Wonderfully surreal, painfully real, this is the story of children, adults and animals who live together trying to have a better life, but sometimes death comes unexpectedly. The lives of three characters surrounded by a bunch of extraordinary, funny, absurd but quite realistic events. It is all about us, people who eat the animals that they love and the animals that love people unconditionally.
