Breezy isn't your ordinary hitch-hiker: she's sexy, fun - and a cold-blooded killer. As deadly as a viper, she murders her victims with a poisonous ring. As she preys on highway pickups, she moves from town to town, finally settling briefly as a boarder in the house of a young couple who have no idea what kind of sexual wolf they've just let in the door.
