The Peruvian anti-terrorist army takes control of a far away and unknown small village isolated in the Andes by the terrorist militia "Sendero Luminoso" (Shining Path), during the dirty war in Peru at 80's decade.
The military anti-terrorist army takes control of "Chuspi", an unknown and faraway small village, isolated by the terrorist group "Sendero Luminoso" (Shining Path). A soldier called Vitin Luna, and other young soldiers face an invisible, perhaps superior force. Their unit is commanded by a brutal lieutenant who declares the entire village guilty of treason. In the face of this crisis, Vitin must choose between blind obedience and his own conscience.
