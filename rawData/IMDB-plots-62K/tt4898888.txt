Anna, mother of three, has lived for forty years in her corner of hell. She was an impertinent and unfortunate girl, but by now she has become a generous woman, perhaps far too tolerant. She is a prisoner of her own duties and of her family. She is comforted by underprivileged "poor little souls", but is actually surrounded by many demons, real and imaginary.
