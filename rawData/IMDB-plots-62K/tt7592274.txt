A film about empathy, and the struggle and distance someone may have to travel--against all odds--to find a better life.
"Weeds" tells the story of a dandelion, rooted on the wrong side of the driveway in a barren yard surrounded by dry dirt and dead grass. Just across the concrete lies another yard, where the sprinklers spray water endlessly, and the greener grass holds the promise of a better life. While watching helplessly as its fellow weeds wither away and die, the dandelion faces a decision: take action or suffer the same fate.
