At age 10, Fanny Price is sent by her destitute mother to live with her aunt and uncle, Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram. As a child she was often made to feel that she was the poor relation but by the time she reaches 18, and in the absence of her uncle who leaves on a business trip for an extended period, she begins to enjoy herself. When Henry Crawford and his sister Mary become neighbors to the Bertrams, opportunities abound. Edmond Bertram falls in love with Mary but she wants to marry a man with money, not someone destined to life as a clergyman. Meanwhile, Fanny's love for her cousin Edmond prevents her from accepting Mr. Crawford's proposal of marriage.
Poor relation Fanny Price is allowed at 10 to live on rich, prestigious Sir Thomas's grand estate Mansfield. Raised almost as one of his own children, she becomes everyone's favorite pet, bonding especially with sensitive Edmund Bertram, who aspires a virtuous vicarage rather then gain or glory. The family feels betrayed when fanny refuses a proposal from even wealthier neighbor Henry Crawford. But even more strenuous times are ahead, with surprising results.
At ten Fanny Price was sent to live with her uncle and aunt, Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram. By the time she has reached eighteen, Fanny has grown to enjoy her life at Mansfield Park - especially with her cousin Edmund's company - until, in Sir Thomas' absence, the manipulative Mary Crawford and her brother Henry arrive at Mansfield Park.
