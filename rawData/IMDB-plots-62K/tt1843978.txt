In 2006, Charlie Lynch was invited by the civic leaders of Morro Bay, CA to open a medical marijuana dispensary within the city limits. Offered a business license and asked to join the Chamber of Commerce, Lynch opened and maintained his business according to the most rigorous standards available. However, marijuana remains a Class 1 narcotic according to the DEA, and Lynch's business soon became the target of a large Federal investigation. This film explores the horrific descent into hell faced by Mr. Lynch - previously a law abiding citizen without so much as a speeding ticket, as he is cast as a Pablo Escobar and thrown into Federal detention.
The outrageous contradictions swirling around the medical marijuana business in the USA are explored in this penetrating documentary which focuses on the 2010 Federal prosecution and conviction of dispensary owner Charles C. Lynch from San Luis Obispo, CA by a rogue and relentless local sheriff.
