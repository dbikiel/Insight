A woman hires a stranger to pose as her husband because she doesn't want her ailing father to know that her fiance broke their engagement.
Kalyani (Renjini) decides to marry her boyfriend against her father's (Poornam Vishwanathan) wish. But her boyfriend ditches her when he comes to know that she would be disinherited. Kalyani's father Ramachandra Menon, who stays in US, is unaware of the broken engagement and comes to India to spend his vacation with his newlywed daughter and son in law. This prompts Kaimail (Nedumudi Venu), who takes care of Kalyani, to hire a stranger named Vishnu (Mohanlal) to play the role of Kalyani's husband. But Kalyani's cousin Bhaskaran (Sreenivasan) is aware that Vishnu is not Kalyani's husband and tries to inform Menon about the truth with proof so that he can inherit Menon's wealth. Meanwhile Vishnu and Kalyani never get on well and keep on fighting. But later she develops an affection for him and wishes that she could marry him. But the arrival of a mysterious stranger (M. G. Soman) gives the story a twist as it unfolds Vishnu's past.
