(Bearskin Prince) Aging king Wenzel's only son and heir, prince Marius, was his father's pride and joy, but showed no interest in state matters, absorbed by fashionable flirt and idle pleasures, taking no suitable suitor serious. On a pleasure ride trough the forest, Marius is caught in the net trap of a devil. They agree that Marius will be released but can only return home is he finds true love within a limited time. Alas for him, the additional challenge is to do so while covered in live bear fur, making him appear a dangerous monstrosity. Wandering hungry, 'bear Marius' gets shot-wounded by mean widow Hedwig and her lazy son Kilian, but is hidden, fed and nursed by their constantly abused maid Elise, who falls in love with the 'bear man'.
