L.E.T.H.A.L. agents, Donna and Nicole, do their best to protect a wealthy Asian businessman and his rare diamond from a sinister international jewel thief.
Chinese businessman Chang owns the fabulous Alexa diamond, stolen from Russia during WWII. He intends to return it to Russia during a gala dinner, but the diamond is stolen by Kane, assisted by his lethal and seductive partner Blu Steele. The Agency, in charge of security at the event, go into high gear to try and recover the diamond. Gunplay, explosions, seductions, lethal remote control helicopters, and general mayhem ensue.
After a narrow escape from an assassination attempt by a team of trained killers, L.E.T.H.A.L. agents, Donna and Nicole, return to the organisation's headquarters, while in Las Vegas, Kane--the agents' old nemesis who is now in league with the dangerously beautiful contract killer, Blu Steele--is plotting his revenge. Back in Hawaii, the duo is ordered to accompany and protect Chang, the wealthy Asian businessman and holder of the "Alexa Diamond", a rare Russian stone of mythical value with a profound history which dates back to WWII. Now, the sinister international jewel thief pursues the seasoned agents from the sunny shores of Hawaii and the casinos of Las Vegas, all the way up to the Museum of Leningrad in freezing Russia. Are Donna and Nicole fit to succeed?
