A cop quits the force after too much disappointment in the system. He becomes a bodyguard of a rich recent widow. She is on trial for her husband's murder. He decides to help her clear her name... and get over her husband.
A womanizing policeman with a tendency for violent arrests quits the department rather than face an inquiry. He is recruited by a defense lawyer to assist with the murder trial of a young beautiful foreign widow whose older rich husband was killed. The wife and her playboy boyfriend are the defendants and the ex-cop is assigned to check out their alibi including a dubious witness. There is a larger criminal conspiracy underway and the relationship of the suspect and her husband and his murder get swept up in the cover up of the real crime.
