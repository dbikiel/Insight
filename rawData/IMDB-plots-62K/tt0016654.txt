Seeking revenge, an athletic young man joins the pirate band responsible for his father's death.
A nobleman vows to avenge the death of his father at the hands of pirates. To this end he infiltrates the pirate band. Acting in character he is instrumental in the capture of a ship, but things are complicated when he finds that there is a young woman on board whom he wishes to protect from the threat of rape.
A certain pirate of the Spanish Main makes a practice of blowing up with all hands the ships he has looted. By a fluke, one man and his dying father survive such a disaster. Swearing vengeance, the son joins the pirates; soon, "the black pirate" swashbuckles his way into their black hearts, capturing a merchantman singlehanded. Can he now save the life of lovely Isobel? Can he, opposed by a treacherous rival, rise to lead the pirates and thereby deliver them to justice?
