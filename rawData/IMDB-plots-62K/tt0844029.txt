The son of an eccentric detective steps into his father's shoes after his mother is wrongly arrested for stealing a baby panda.
"I will try to be normal" 12-year-old Ace Ventura Jr. promises. Thats cool, except whats normal for him is finding missing mutts, kidnapped kitties or gone gators and creating hilarious chaos every step of the way. Like father, like son, its in his nature to be a pet defective detective! And when a zoos baby panda is stolen and Aces mom is Suspect #1, our young hero sets out to clear the family name. Its a new generation of family fun and goof-brained comedy panda-monium as Ace Ventura Jr. (Josh Flitter of Nancy Drew and License to Wed) teams with adventurous girl-next-door Laura (Emma Lockhart) and nerdish gizmo-wiz A-Plus (Austin Rogers) to chase down leads and laughs. Ready for fun? Allriiiighty-then. Ace - Ace Jr. is on the case!
