In 1874, after noticing the total lawlessness in Wichita, Wyatt Earp reluctantly accepts the Marshal's job and runs into the worst local troublemakers.
Former buffalo hunter and entrepreneur Wyatt Earp arrives in the lawless cattle town of Wichita Kansas. His skill as a gun-fighter make him a perfect candidate for Marshal but he refuses the job until he feels morally obligated to bring law and order to this wild town.
In 1874, when Wyatt Earp accedes to the pleas of Wichita, Kansas town-leaders such as Banker McCoy, Mayor Hope and Newspaper Editor Whiteside to accept the job of law-enforcement officer of Wichita, he immediately jails the trail-crew of Clint Wallace's Big W Ranch for tearing up the town following a cattle drive from Texas. McCoy and town merchants believe Earp has gone too far, but he refuses to relax his strict rules of law enforcement and McCoy turns against him. "Doc" Black, a saloon owner, plots to have Earp killed. The latter, with the help of his two brothers, Jim and Morgan, and a local newspaper reporter, "Bat" Masterson. McCoy's daughter, Laurie, also sides with the lawman. Wyatt orders Black out of town, but Black returns with two of Wallace's toughest gunmen, Gyp and Hal Clements, and a deadly gun-battle begins.
