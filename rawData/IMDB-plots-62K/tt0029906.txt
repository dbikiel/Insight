Drama about a problem child and her problem parents.
Roberta Morgan is being raised in a wealthy-home where her mother is occupied with her society-club activities and her father is immersed in his business activities. She also feels that the hired help and her governess are against her, and, in her mind, only her father's confidential secretary-assistant seems to understand her needs and problems. Her incorrigibility leads to her being placed in a boarding school for problem girls. There, the secretary and the head of the school work a plan to win her over by giving her responsibilities for helping the younger girls in the school.
Within the extremely well-to-do Morgan household, businessman John Morgan leaves the running of their household to his social matron wife, Evelyn Morgan, those responsibilities including setting the rules for their thirteen year old daughter, Roberta Morgan. All but neglected by her parents as they, self-absorbed, go about their own individual lives, Roberta hates both her governess Anna and especially the household butler Jenkins for they carrying out Mrs. Morgan's strict rules for her without any discretion. In return, Roberta acts out as she believes her mother doesn't want her to have anything she truly wants. The only person who Roberta considers a friend is the Morgans' personal assistant, Jerome Williams. Things begin to change when Roberta meets and befriends a poor back boy named Pinkie White, whose family seems happy in their love for each other despite their poverty. Pinkie is the first person close to her own age she has considered a friend. But in meeting Pinkie, all Jenkins can see is a little ragamuffin. It isn't until a tragedy occurs that Roberta meets caring Helen Cosgrove, a girls school superintendent. From that relationship, Roberta may finally receive the understanding of a true person of authority in her life, and that a path for reconciliation within the Morgan household can occur.
