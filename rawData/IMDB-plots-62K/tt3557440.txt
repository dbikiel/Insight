Achmed is having a very bad day. As if accidentally blowing himself up so that he's just a talking skeleton with eyeballs isn't bad enough, the world's most incompetent terrorist finds himself whisked away from his homeland by a bald eagle and taken to Americaville, USA.
Achmed is having a very bad day. As if accidentally blowing himself up so that he's just a talking skeleton with eyeballs isn't bad enough, the world's most incompetent terrorist finds himself whisked away from his homeland by a bald eagle and taken to Americaville, USA. While there, he meets a kindly middle-class family named Wilson who --- believing he is a foreign-exchange student whom they'd been expecting --- takes him in, and Achmed begins to experience first-hand what America really is all about, rather than what he'd been "brainwashed" by his boss and other leftist extremists into believing. Achmed participates in a huge parade and other delightful festivities and recreational activities, and eventually becomes disillusioned with his terrorist ways and learns to love America, despite its flaws and excesses. However, his happiness is abruptly cut short when his former terrorist-boss, Hassan, unexpectedly shows up and tries to convince Achmed to return with him to "The Third World". Disheartened, Achmed initially consents, but then he sees that his savior-family is being taken to Guantanamo Prison due to their having "harbored a terrorist". Achmed is horrified, and races to stop the prison bus. In the end, he and the Wilson family are happily reunited, and Hassan eventually also has a change of heart, as well, and ends up emigrating to America, too. Hassan takes a job as a chef at his favorite fast-food joint, while the explosives-loving Achmed creates custom-made sculptures out of rock that he detonates with dynamite-charges.
