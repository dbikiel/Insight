Three estranged sisters deal with the death of their father.
Claire is the middle sister, both literally and metaphorically. She's 29 has a stagnant writing career and her boyfriend dumps her. Her sisters are reluctantly there to support her, but she doesn't want their help anyway. Sharon is the older successful sister; she's a wife and a mother and sees it as her job to take care of her family. Kendra's the youngest sister; she's a struggling artist with a free-spirited outlook on life. The sisters are completely different and don't always get along. But then their father shares life-changing news and they are forced to come together whether they want to or not.
