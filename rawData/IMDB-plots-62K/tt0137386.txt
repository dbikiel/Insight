Billy is a gay fine-arts photographer who falls in love with straight coffee-shop waiter Gabriel.
Billy, a struggling young gay photographer (who likes Polaroids), tired of being the "other man", falls in love with Gabriel, a waiter and aspiring musician who is probably straight but possibly gay or at least curious. Billy tries to get Gabriel to model for his latest project, a series of remakes of famous Hollywood screen kisses, featuring male couples, while also trying to win his affections.
Twenty-six year old Billy Collier is a struggling Los Angeles based photographer - his camera of choice being a Polaroid, it being for somewhat emotional reasons - and film buff. But the category under which he is arguably most often classified is gay man. He moved to Los Angeles from repressive small town Indiana to spread his gay wings. However, he doesn't want to be the stereotypical gay man in having indiscriminate sex with any man that comes along, which he how he feels being the "other man" in his current lover Fernando's life, but rather spend his life with a committed and loving partner. Coinciding with his gay friend Perry offering him a commission for a photographic series - Billy choosing the theme of recreating famous Hollywood screen kisses - Billy meets musician cum coffee house waiter Gabriel, with who he has an immediate infatuation as arguably the person to who he has had the strongest physical attraction. Beyond it being a non-pickup pickup line, Billy asks him to be one of the models for his photo series to which he agrees. Gabriel identifies as straight - his girlfriend Natalie who lives in San Francisco - but Billy believes he gets a strong gay vibe from him, which may be only wishful thinking on his part if history of his gaydar is any indication. A friendship develops between the two, which only makes it more difficult for Billy to decide whether to act on the gay vibe he feels emanating from Gabriel.
