Two bourgeois couples choose a typical Italian restaurant by its name, 'La Trattoria', and are disgusted by the poor service and its untidiness. An elegant lady in her splendid Ferrari is accosted by an Italian and imagines a flirt, but he's all eyes - for the car. An Italian wife finds the husband in bed with another woman, but he is so good with his explanation that she ends up believing it was all her fault for not being enough time with him...
