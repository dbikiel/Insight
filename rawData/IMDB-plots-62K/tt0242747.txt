A hapless and desperate music producer hires a talented housewife to lip sync the songs of an attractive but talentless starlet to further his and her music career, and tries to keep up the charade when their album becomes a success.
In the age of music videos, the success and marketing of the next sexy superstar has little to do with actual singing talent. Such is the case with Sunni, a young want-to-be superstar with an attitude, who's about to record her first album. Robert Deacon is a one-time high-flying producer, whose popularity has gone downhill, who thinks he can make it big again with this sex kitten. Despite Sunni's backing by a record company mogul, there's little Deacon can do to turn her tin ear into gold. While drowning his sorrows at a karaoke bar, he discovers Maggie Stanley, a young housewife who's more at home in the kitchen than behind a microphone. Maggie has an amazing voice and Deacon convinces her to lend her voice to what she believes is a demo tape. Maggie's voice is dubbed over Sunni's entire album. When the debut album rockets up the charts, not even the star singer is aware that her hit songs are the work of a suburban housewife. With the public clamoring for a live performance, the record company pushing "Sunni Mania", and Maggie getting wind of where her demos actually end up, this tangled mess just keeps getting worse with each attempt to conceal the truth.
