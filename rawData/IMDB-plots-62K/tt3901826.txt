In 2001, Afghanistan is under the control of the Taliban. When her father is captured, a determined young girl disguises herself as a boy in order to provide for her family.
From executive producer Angelina Jolie and the creators of the Academy Award nominated The Secret of Kells and Song of the Sea, comes the highly-anticipated new feature based on Deborah Ellis' bestselling novel. Parvana is an 11-year-old girl growing up under the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001. When her father is wrongfully arrested, Parvana cuts off her hair and dresses like a boy in order to support her family. Working alongside her friend Shauzia, Parvana discovers a new world of freedom-and danger. With undaunted courage, Parvana draws strength from the fantastical stories she invents, as she embarks on a quest to find her father and reunite her family. Equal parts thrilling and enchanting, The Breadwinner is an inspiring and luminously animated tale about the power of stories to sustain hope and carry us through dark times.
Under the Taliban's strict rule, somewhere in the dusty and bustling town of Kabul in Afghanistan, the 11-year-old girl, Parvana, helps her father sell the family's goods in the market, amidst potential customers and gun-toting fundamentalists. But when her dad is incarcerated on a convenient and unjust pretext, it's up to the spirited Parvana's resourcefulness to feed and care for the rest of her family with the use of a desperate and daring plan. Eventually, as Parvana, the youthful storyteller, takes matters into her own hands wandering all alone on the perilous streets, an unexpected friend will provide hope and a sense of freedom. But is a will of iron enough to survive in a man's world?
