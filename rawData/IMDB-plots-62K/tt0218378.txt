A prospector who sold his wife and infant daughter in exchange for a mining claim, tries desperately to win them back as he helps to build the Pacific Railroad with a group of pioneer friends.
A prospector sells his wife and daughter to another gold miner for the rights to a gold mine. Twenty years later, the prospector is a wealthy man who owns much of the old west town named Kingdom Come. But changes are brewing and his past is coming back to haunt him. A surveyor and his crew scout the town as a location for a new railroad line and a young woman suddenly appears in the town and is evidently the man's daughter.
Based on Thomas Hardy's The Mayor of Casterbridge, The Claim follows the story of Daniel Dillon, who traded his wife and newborn daughter for a gold mine. 20 years later he is thrown into a kind of hell in the prospecting city he controls is being surveyed as potential railroad route and the wife and daughter that he hocked for his riches show up as well.
