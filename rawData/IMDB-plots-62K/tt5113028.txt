Mirko Talhammer is beyond himself when two strange guys show up in his noble insurance office and remind him where he really comes from: from a scrapyard in the provinces, where careers are not what counts, other things are more important: scrapping things, the family, and every once in a while, a nice fist fight. Mirko left all that behind, but his father messes things up big time when he dies and leaves his son the run down scrapyard - together with his brother Letscho. And Letscho is still ticked off that Mirko deserted the clan. But soon the brothers realize that the Talhammers only have a future if they can pull themselves together and fulfill their father's last wish: to rob a train like real professionals! The coup itself is like a suicide mission, but then Kercher, the Talhammer's biggest nemesis, gets wind of things...
Mirko Talhammer was his father Vito's designated successor as head of the semi-nomadic family's scrapyard, dependent on petty metal robberies, but left that to his dumber brother Letscho, studying and starting an insurance office in Hamburg. After Vito's death, two hard-handed henchmen remind Mirko he inherited half the scrapyard as his father died and must convince unwilling, vindictively-hostile co-heir brother Letscho, to sell and move. Instead Mirko finds himself drawn into Vito's posthumous 'master plan' to literally steal a trainload of copper for the Talhammers as nest-egg, but even as he gives the ignorant plan a learned makeover, it goes pear-shaped due to the traitorous rival-fence Wolfgang Kercher, so the clan must come up with a cunning plan C.
