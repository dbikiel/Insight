Cole Armin, recruited by his corrupt uncle as heir apparent to his freight-hauling empire, defects to his honest rival.
Cole Armin comes to Albuquerque to work for his uncle, John Armin, a despotic and hard-hearted czar who operates an ore-hauling freight line, and whose goal is to eliminate a competing line run by Ted Wallace and his sister Celia. Cole tires of his uncle's heavy-handed tactics and switches over to the Wallace side. Lety Tyler, an agent hired by the uncle, also switches over by warning Cole and Ted of a trap set for them by the uncle and his henchman Juke Murkil.
While traveling from Texas to Albuquerque on a stagecoach, Cole Armin and the other passengers are robbed by criminals on the road. There is a shootout and the horses dart with a little girl inside the stagecoach, but Cole rescues her. Cole, who is traveling to the town to work for his powerful uncle John Armin, discovers that his uncle is a hated man operating the local freight company. John is trying to destroy the competition: Ted Wallace and his sister Celia, who had 10,000 dollars stolen from them at the robbery on the stagecoach. Furthermore, Cole learns that John Armin is responsible for the heist and he forces his uncle to return the stolen amount to the Wallace siblings. Cole proposes a partnership with Ted and Celia and they form the Wallace &amp; Armin Freighting Company. The new company gets profitable contracts with the local mines and John Armin hires the outsider Letty Tyler to work for Ted, Celia and Cole and spy on their business. He also uses his henchman Steve Murkill (Lon Chaney Jr.) to frame Cole and attempt to put him out of business.
