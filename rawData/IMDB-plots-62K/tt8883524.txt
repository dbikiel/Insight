Evan values family above all else, and anyone who gets between him, his wife, and newborn son learns that the hard way. But when it comes to violent tendencies, it seems the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
In this crime horror thriller inspired by the style of 70s horror films from directors like Brian De Palma and Dario Argento, an introverted husband and father named Evan, who works as a high school guidance counselor, becomes a brutal vigilante serial killer who targets all those who abuse the children who confide in him, especially if the abusers are their parents.
Evan takes his job as a social worker at a high school very seriously - maybe too seriously. It won't be long before his wife, Lauren, starts to become suspicious of her husband's activities, all loaded with violence, and the couple will soon spiral out of control. Seann William Scott turns his back once and for all on his performance in American Pie with this family man and part-time serial killer.
