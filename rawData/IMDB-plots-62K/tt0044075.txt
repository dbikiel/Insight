Upon later arriving at Lucy's house, Marsha is shocked to see that Hank was one of the Klansmen committing the murder, he being a Klansman of which Lucy is unaware. Marsha decides to confront Hank and Lucy about what she saw. Meanwhile, county prosecutor Burt Rainey knows that the Klan committed the murder, everyone in town is aware that the Klan committed the murder, but Rainey knows that no one will come forward to implicate the Klan for what they see is the good of the town. He is also aware that Marsha would have been in the area when the murder was committed and wants to talk to her and hope that being an outsider will allow her to speak freely if she did indeed see anything. Marsha has to decide what to say to Rainey specifically taking into account how best to protect her and Lucy's welfare, which includes the fact that Lucy is pregnant with Hank's baby.
