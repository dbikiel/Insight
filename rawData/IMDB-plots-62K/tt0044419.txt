The success of the journey focuses on keeping the Indian girl alive as well as themselves to complete trade with the Blackfeet.
Jim Deakins is a frontiersman and Indian trader who is making a perilous journey with a group of other men up the Missouri River to get a large haul of furs from friendly Blackfoot Indians. The problem is that they have to get through hostile Indian territory first and they find that they have seriously underestimated the difficulties they will undergo. The large body of men who started the journey are gradually whittled down until only a hardy few, like Deakins, are left.
In the early 1830's a group of men head up the Missouri river to trade with the Indians for fur pelts. Their goal is to meet the Blackfeet who have been friendly and are keen to trade. Jim Deakins is a member of the group and he is particularly interested in a Blackfoot woman, Teal Eye, who is traveling with the group. But then, so is his friend, Boone Caudill. Along the way they must face many dangers, from Mother Nature and the river itself as well as the fur trading company who want to keep their monopoly on trade. There are hostile Indians as well and slowly the men begin to wonder just how far they will make and whether they stand a chance of returning alive.
Frontiersmen Boone and Jim Deakins join up with Boone's Uncle Zeb on a fur-trading expedition into the uncharted Blackfoot territory. The expedition's leader, the Frenchman Jourdonnais, has a plan for succeeding where no white man has traded before: he plans to return a kidnapped Blackfoot princess, Teal Eye, to her people and thus to win their gratitude and trade. Guided by Teal Eye and a crazy warrior named Poordevil, the trappers travel upriver, only to find their greatest obstacle is not Indians, but a ruthless pack of fur traders led by MacMasters and his henchman Streak. Along the way, Boone and Jim Deakins both fall under the spell of the beautiful Teal Eye, and their friendship begins to crack.
