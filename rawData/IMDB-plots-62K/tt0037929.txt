Jerry Mouse gets tired of living the country life and decides to head to the big city. However, the experience doesn't turn out quite like Jerry had expected.
Jerry decides he needs a vacation from the county and Tom so he leaves Tom a note and heads for New York City for some peace and quiet. However, Jerry has a number of unpleasant experiences in New York (being chased by cars and cats among other things) and it isn't long before he changes his mind and heads back home to the country.
