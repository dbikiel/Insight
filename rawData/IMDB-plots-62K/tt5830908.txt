The juxtaposition of Chinese and Canadian cultures as seen through the eyes of a recent immigrant.
Li Fang (Wensi Yan) is a Chinese immigrant who has been living in Montreal for over 10 years. Her infertility and her violent separation from her Québécois husband, Eric (Émile Proulx-Cloutier), have pushed her to the brink of despair. Escaping the chaos in Montreal, Li Fang visits her grandfather in Dazu, her birthplace in south China. The support and inspiration provided by her family and an old lover helps her break the impasse in her life.
