The impact that Princess Diana's death has on the lives of four ordinary British people.
In 1997 news that Princess Diana has just died in a car crash is particularly resonant for young Jack Hawkins, whose own mother has just passed away. Estranged from his father Colin, he seeks help from neighbour Russell, leading to mutual romance, before reconciling with Colin at his mother's funeral. Meanwhile in Bradford unhappy wife Yasmin, whose domineering, debt-ridden husband Hassan has no sympathy with Diana - claiming she should have stayed with Prince Charles - sees the chance to escape with her little girl to her uncle Zaheer, in London, where she relishes her new-found independence. In Scotland florist Mary McDonald, caring for her dementia-stricken mother, sees an opportunity to drive to London with business partner Gordie and sell flowers to the mourning public whilst on honeymoon in Paris ambitious journalist Michael Lewis is also aware that Diana's death will give him his big break but it costs him his marriage. Mary is also disappointed by her lack of success but Gordie provides her with an unexpected reward.
