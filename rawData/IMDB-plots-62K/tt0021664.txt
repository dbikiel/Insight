Bimbo the dog is initiated into a secret society in a sadistic 'fun house'; then Betty Boop (with dog's ears) takes a hand.
Bimbo finds himself surrounded by a mysterious group of robed figures who invite him to become a member of their secret organization. When he refuses, they fling him through a nightmarish sequence of terror and torture devices. Will our hapless hero make it out alive?
The members of Do-It-Or-Die, "filled with college pep," declare via song that they'll force Bimbo the dog to join their mystic order. Sure enough, an unsuspecting Bimbo is walking down the street when he suddenly falls into a manhole; and it's no ordinary manhole either. He drops through a long, winding chute that leads to an underground room filled with strange, plump, bearded men with hats made of half-melted candles and outfits that cover their entire bodies like children's pajamas. "Wanna be a member?" asks the leader. "No!" declares Bimbo. To force him into acquiescence, the men take him through a series of bizarre ordeals in various rooms with multifarious death traps.
