A worldwide viral outbreak has devastated the world. There is no government, no infrastructure. Electricity is scarce. The sky is full of autonomous drones that were developed by the Sky Medix corporation to deliver vaccines. But by the time the drones were online, it was too late: 90% of the population was gone. Now the drones fly empty missions, dropping vaccines everywhere, though there is nobody left to use them.After being separated from his father, 16-year-old Kitch is trying to lead a normal life in this post-apocalyptic world. When he discovers a strange drone following him, Kitchs life becomes anything but normal: Kitch believes this drone, DR1, can lead him to his father, whom Kitch thought was dead. As Kitch prepares for his journey, he meets Maya, a girl that works for the local powermonger, 4C. Though they are practically strangers, Maya decides to help Kitch, and together Kitch, Maya and DR1 start their journey.Meanwhile, 4C uses all his men and resources to find Kitch and Maya, which causes him to fall behind on collecting power to get the grid back up so electricity can be restored. While he has his aggressive thugs AJ and Greg tracking down Kitch and Maya, 4C sends his most loyal follower, Hashtag, to place a huge bet on a drone race to get back on track. 4C risks everything so he can find the one thing he cares about in life, Maya.As Kitch and Maya follow DR1 to Kitchs father, they encounter people from all walks of life that have had their lives turned upside down by the outbreak. DR1 leads Kitch and Maya to an unexpected destination, where Kitch is reunited with his father and Kitch learns that he holds the key to saving the next generation from the virus.
