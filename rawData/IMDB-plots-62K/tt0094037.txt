The zany "stewdents" at a wacky flight attendants' school have all sorts of wild and crazy high-flying adventures in this '80s comedy.
A typical 80's teen pseudo-sex comedy. A group of varied misfits (including a former prostitute/stripper and a bumbler who can't see more than 6 inches in front of his face) enter a school to become flight attendants. Somehow, the group makes it through to the final test: a cross-country flight.
