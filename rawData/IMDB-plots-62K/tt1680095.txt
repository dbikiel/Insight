On Christmas Eve in Milan, three friends dressed in Santa Claus costumes are arrested by the police during an apparent robbery attempt and taken to a police station, where the Chief Bestetti accuses them of being the band of thieves known as the "Santa Clauses Band". In search of a way to prove their innocence, the three try to explain the reasons for which they found themselves in such strange situation.
