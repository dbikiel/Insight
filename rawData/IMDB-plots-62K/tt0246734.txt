She may be cute. She may be young. She may seem innocent and naive, but don't be fooled. She's a cold-blooded killer, and if you're on the wrong side of the law, you may be her next target. After being orphaned at a young age, her parents victims of a brutal double murder, Sawa was taken in by the detective assigned to her case. Not content to just watch as the imperfect justice system let more and more criminals go loose every day, he's decided to train her to be his instrument of justice. After all, who'd suspect a pretty college student of being a deadly vigilante?
Sawa is a school girl, an orphan, and a hitman. She's under the control of Akai and Kanie, who give her targets to kill, detailing to her the crimes these men have committed. Some of Akai and Kanie's power over Sawa has to do with her deceased parents and a pair of earrings that are her prized possessions. Akai and Kanie bring Sawa in to assist another orphan, Oburi, with a multiple hit. Oburi and Sawa become friends, and this friendship may give Sawa the strength to break from her controllers, whose crimes against her are as abusive as the crimes ascribed to the men they have her kill.
