A raw and unparalleled DIY documentary about the West Coast Punk scene made by a group of young fans/filmmakers about the bands they loved.
A fly on the wall look at Southern California's exploding hardcore punk scene in the early 1980's. More like a xerox fanzine than a glossy MTV document, "The Slog Movie" is one of director David Markey's early films, and is a baby brother to his film ten years later "1991 The Year Punk Broke". Like that film, The Slog puts the viewer right there, in the middle of the madness, leaving them to draw their own conclusions, totally atypical of 99% of most rock docs. Featuring Circle Jerks, Black Flag (uncredited, due to Greg Ginn's insanity), Fear, Red Cross (before they became Redd Kross), TSOL, Sin 34 (Markey's band), The Cheifs, Circle One, &amp; Symbol 6.
