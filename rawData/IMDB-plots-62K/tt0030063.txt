Divorce lawyer Everard Logan thinks the woman who spent the night in his hotel room is the erring wife of his new client.
Laurence Olivier plays Logan, a barrister who falls in love with Leslie (played by Merle Oberon), the woman he thinks his client will soon be divorcing.
Fogbound in a hotel, Leslie Steele tricks handsome, cynical divorce lawyer Everard Logan into sharing his suite. She lets him think she's married. The next day, Lord Mere, whose thrice- divorced wife spent the night with a man in the same hotel, comes to Logan for a divorce. Leslie delightedly teases Logan with her imaginary scandalous past, while fascinating him irresistably. Then she joins forces with the real Lady Mere.
