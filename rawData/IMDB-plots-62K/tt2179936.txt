A high school freshman wants to be part of the most popular dance clique in his school but he tends to freeze in the spotlight and has no clue how he's going to pass the initiation.
High schooler Jason has found his dream girl-the gorgeous Anastacia. There's just one problem: she doesn't know he exists. If he can win a spot on the school's hottest dance crew, Jason might have a shot. But before he does, he'll have to overcome his battle-ax of a mother, survive Anastacia's gangsta brother, and pass the crew's initiation.
