A warlord's son is cursed to be reborn lifetime after lifetime and fated to love and lose until the curse is lifted.
When a Viking warlord defies his god, Odin's fury is so great, that he curses the warlord's son to die and be reborn as a Berserker - an immortal fanatic, immune to pain, consumed by bloodlust and rage - a hell's warrior. Until he can lift the curse, the prince is forever doomed to live a desolate, insane and violent life and to fall in love with, and lose, the same Valkyrie over and over again. Pursued by the cult of the Berserkers and the rest of the Valkyrie host, his is the perpetual battle between good and evil.
