The Lindsay's are on a ship to Hawaii for their delayed second honeymoon. Unknown to Carmelita, Dennis is using the trip to secure a contract with Mr. Baldwin. The Baldwins are social climbers that will do business with Lindsay if they can meet Lord Epping. Of course, trouble brews when Uncle Matt pretends to be Lord Epping and Fifi pretends to be Mrs. Lindsay.
