8 June, 2013. 800 people enter an abandoned cinema in Barcelona to project a documentary film. The old building is renamed as "Cinema Patricia Heras" in honor of a girl who committed suicide two years earlier. But who is Patricia? Why she decided to commit suicide? How his death related to Barcelona? The answers to these questions are exactly what they want to publicize with this illegal and high media impact action: the truth about one of the worst cases of police corruption in Barcelona is known, in the dead city.
