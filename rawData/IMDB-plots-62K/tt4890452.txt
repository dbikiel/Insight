Set in wave after wave of stunningly visual earthscapes, Given blooms into a tender yet stirring exploration of a young boy's understanding of life through his familial bonds and their reverence for nature. Deeply moving, Given gives us the humbling contrast of a small voice voyaging through a big world as it finds its way home again.
