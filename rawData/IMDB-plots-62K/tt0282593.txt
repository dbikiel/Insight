A woman experiences five blind dates in one year, but only one of them is "Mr. Right".
It's an hour before Lucy's wedding and her best friend wants to hear all about what led up to that moment. So, Lucy tells about the five men she had blind dates with over the past year (Doug, Gabriel, Bobby, Barry, and Luke) and her experiences with each one. As each date is told at the same time as the other four, the many ups and downs of new relationships are shown. So, while some dates start off terribly, but end well others are just the opposite. But which one of the five men is Lucy about to walk down the aisle with?
