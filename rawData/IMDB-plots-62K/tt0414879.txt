Images flash through Arthur's brain, voices buzz in his mind, uttering disjointed words and sentences. Arthur Seligman seems to have had an accident but did he run over a little boy or not? And what was he doing near Cherbourg while he lives in Paris? When he regains consciousness (but does he really?) Isabelle Kruger, a nurse, tells him that he had lapsed into a coma after his accident and that she wrote down all of what he said while he was delirious. She gives him the notebook and Arthur starts investigating...HIMSELF!
While driving in a winding narrow road, Arthur Seligman has an accident and capsizes with his car and awakes from a short coma in a hospital in Cherbourg. With amnesia and without recalling why he left Paris, Arthur is informed by the nurse Isabelle Kruger that he had spoken lots of senseless sentences and she gives her notes to him. Arthur reads the disjointed sentences and many images flash in his brain while he tries to find his missing brother, using drugs and psychiatric treatment in his investigation. Suddenly, his reality changes to another one, and Arthur discloses innermost secrets hidden in his mind since his childhood and finds the truth about his brother and himself.
