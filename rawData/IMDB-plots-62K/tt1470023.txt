Former special operative MacGruber is called back into action to take down his arch-enemy, Dieter Von Cunth, who's in possession of a nuclear warhead and bent on destroying Washington, D.C.
In the Dzhugdzhur Mountains, Eastern Siberia, the criminal Dieter Von Cunth steals a Russian X5 nuclear warhead. Colonel James Faith travels to Rio Bamba, Ecuador, with the efficient Lieutenant Dixon Piper to summon the retired special operative MacGruber to retrieve the X5. MacGruber is considered deceased after the death of his beloved wife Casey by his archenemy Cunth in their wedding. MacGruber teams up with Piper and Vicki St. Elmo and they learn that the evil Cunth intends to use the warhead to destroy Washington D.C.
Former special ops agent, the eccentric MacGruber, was long thought to be dead, following the murder of his wife Casey Janine Fitzpatrick during their wedding ceremony ten years ago. MacGruber did not believe in the use of guns, but rather self-made tools and weapons on the spur of the moment with whatever materials were on hand, and did not believe in working off of plans. However, MacGruber is still very much alive and has dropped out of western society to recover emotionally from Casey's murder, recover which he knows he will never be able to do. Colonel Jim Faith is able to locate MacGruber and coerce him out of retirement as MacGruber's arch enemy, Dieter von Cunth, who is thought to be Casey's murderer, has stolen a nuclear warhead, his intended use of it unknown. The one saving grace at this point is that Cunth does not have the codes to launch it. MacGruber's task is to prevent Cunth from using the warhead, either by eliminating him, recovering the warhead, and/or preventing Cunth from getting the codes. Rather than use his dream team of former associates for this mission, he is relegated to a team of three: himself, his former associate Vicki St. Elmo who he has to convince to return to work rather than focus on her stumbling music career, and Lt. Dixon Piper, more typical of the traditional special op member, he who is Faith's choice but who MacGruber hates. Beyond actions by Cunth to carry out his intended use of the warhead, MacGruber and his team face the obstacles of the differences between MacGruber and Piper, the former who is constantly putting his team at risk in his "my way or the high way" attitude. Through it all, MacGruber has to decide if he can love again as his reunion with Vicki brings to the surface their mutual attraction, that love which has always existed on Vicki's side despite being Casey's best friend.
Only one American hero has earned the rank of Green Beret, Navy SEAL and Army Ranger. Just one operative has been awarded 16 purple hearts, 3 Congressional Medals of Honor and 7 presidential medals of bravery. And only one guy is man enough to still sport a mullet. In 2010, Will Forte brings Saturday Night Live's clueless soldier of fortune to the big screen in the action comedy MacGruber. In the 10 years since his fianc√©e was killed, special op MacGruber has sworn off a life of fighting crime with his bare hands. But when he learns that his country needs him to find a nuclear warhead that's been stolen by his sworn enemy, Dieter Von Cunth (Val Kilmer), MacGruber figures he's the only one tough enough for the job. Assembling an elite team of experts--Lt. Dixon Piper (Ryan Phillippe) and Vicki St. Elmo (Kristen Wiig)--MacGruber will navigate an army of assassins to hunt down Cunth and bring him to justice. His methods may be unorthodox. His crime scenes may get messy. But if you want the world saved right, you call in MacGruber.
