Lazy boy sold himself into a slavery to the creepy robot.
The boy came from school, threw the briefcase into the corner, right in the sneakers, without taking off the shoes, went into his room, turned on the TV and sat down to watch the animated film. Grandmother asks him to go for milk or to clean the mess, but he brushes it off. He doesn't want to do anything, just watch cartoons and play. Having played enough, the boy collapses on the bed and dreams: "Eh, there would be such a country where nothing needs to be done, only games ..." Dreaming, he falls asleep and dreams that a robot appears in the room. He invites the boy to the country Nekhochukhia.
