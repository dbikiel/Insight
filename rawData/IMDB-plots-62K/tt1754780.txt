When two friends attempt to discover who created their favorite childhood action figure, they end up uncovering a heated battle for credit that's lasted 30 years and is filled with more colorful characters than any toy store aisle. Filmmakers Roger Lay, Jr. and Corey Landis set out to document the origin of He-Man--the central character in a billion-dollar multi-media franchise--and along the way, they begin to realize that the truth may not be as simple as they'd hoped. Join them as they go from interview to interview of conflicting stories about how it all began--and try to figure out who's lying and who's telling the truth--in this fun, informative doc that plays like the 'King Of Kong' of the toy world.
