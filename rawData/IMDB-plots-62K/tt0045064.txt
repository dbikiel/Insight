Strategic targets on Earth are being destroyed by an unknown weapon. Government security head Henderson suspects it's an "atomic ray" originating from the moon! He assigns Commando Cody, scientist and man of action with a secret flying suit, to investigate. Soon, Cody is battling Earth thugs in the pay of Krog the moon man and making trips in his experimental rocket to the moon itself, in a perilous and all but singlehanded effort to thwart the planned invasion of Earth.
Commando Cody, 'Sky Marshal of the Universe'(George Wallace), works with American scientists Joan Gilbert (Aline Towne) and Ted Richards (William Bakewell) in the development of a flying suit and a rocket to the Moon. When the nation's defenses are being sabotaged and destroyed, Cody learns that an atomic-gun is being used and that the men on the moon are the culprits. Cody, Joan and Ted take off in a rocket to the moon and, upon arrival, Cody is captured by moon-henchmen, working for Retik (Roy Barcroft), who seeks to capture and rule the earth. But, at the end of chapter one, Cody appears to be in no position to keep Retik from achieving his goal.
