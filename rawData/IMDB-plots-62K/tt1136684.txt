Things go horribly wrong when Catherine and Rebecca, two Catholic school girls, knock on the wrong door while selling religious paraphernalia.
Catherine and Rebecca are two Catholic school girls going door-to-door selling religious paraphernalia in order to pay for their books and education. Things go horribly wrong when they knock on the wrong door in the wrong neighborhood. "Run! Bitch Run!" is a throwback to the classic rape and revenge films like The Last House on the Left (1972) and Ms .45 (1981).
Hundreds of miles away from Saint Mary's School for Girls and Sister Teresa's ever-watchful eye, two innocent Catholic girls--the virginal, Catherine, and the sassy bad girl, Rebecca--struggle to eke out a living by selling Bibles. When the girls stumble into a blood-drenched scene of massacre inside the drug den of the degenerate pimp, Loco Lobo, naked Catherine will end up left for dead deep in the woods. Now, dressed up like a nurse from hell, Catherine embarks on a pitiless journey of retribution, bent on hunting Lobo's perverts down. Her pump-action shotgun and her thirsty machete demand justice. Who dares to stand in the way of the blonde executor?
