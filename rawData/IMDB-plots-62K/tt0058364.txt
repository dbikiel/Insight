Fascinating underwater documentary filmed with hand-held cameras by frogmen and mostly filmed in deep-water seas from within a special designed batiscaff, by the Cousteau family of sea explorers.
In this Oscar-winning documentary, legendary oceanographer Jacques-Yves Cousteau explores Continental Shelf Station Two, an early-1960s attempt at underwater living located 10 meters below the surface of the Red Sea off the coast of Sudan. Subjected to constant observation and medical experimentation, the six men taking part in the experiment have air, food, water, electricity and other life essentials, as well as a small two-man submarine that they can use for underwater exploration.
