A woman goes on the hunt for her dream man, armed with her wild imagination, her passion for Masala-films, and her ultra-sensitive sense of smell.
Wildly imaginative and film-obsessed, Meenakshi Deshpande has an extra sensitive nose. After she is hired to work in a local college's library, she catches a wonderful scent in the air. The source is Surya, a handsome and enigmatic art student from a Tamil family. Meanwhile, Meenakshi's eccentric Marathi family has arranged for her marriage to Madhav, a kind and sensible man. Meenakshi is torn between marrying her parents' choice for a seemingly ideal husband, or following her nose and chasing the hunky stranger who may or may not be all that he seems.
