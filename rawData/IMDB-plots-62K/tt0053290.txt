After becoming king of ancient Israel, Solomon faces threats coming from his jealous dispossessed brother Adonijah, the Egyptian Pharaoh and the scheming Queen of Sheba.
Shortly before his death in ancient Israel King David has a vision from God telling him that his younger son Solomon should succeed him as king. His other son Adonijah is unhappy and vows to attain the throne. Meanwhile the Egyptian Pharoah agrees to cede a Red Sea port to the Queen of Sheba if she can find a way to destroy Solomon, whose wisdom and benevolent rule is seen as a threat to more tyrannical monarchs in the region. Sheba, Pharoah, Adonijah, the leaders of the Twelve Tribes and his own God make life difficult for Solomon who is tempted by Sheba to stray.
Just prior to his death, King David names his younger son, Solomon, his heir ahead of his elder son Prince Adonijah. Solomon is wise and rules his kingdom well but when the Queen of Sheba arrives in Jerusalem, supposedly for a friendly visit, he slowly falls in love with her. In fact, the Queen is in league with the Pharaoh of Egypt and her aim is to divide the twelve tribes of Israel and uses the disaffected Prince Adonijah in her plans. Over time however, she too falls in love with King Solomon choosing to side with him against the Pharaoh.
