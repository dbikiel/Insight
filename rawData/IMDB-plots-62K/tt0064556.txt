Though mostly known for his gritty yakuza dramas and, now, his legendary cult film Battle Royale, Kinji Fukasaku's career ranges across (and liberally messes around with) many genres. Black Rose Mansion is one of his least definable films. Famous drag-star/singer Akihiro Maruyama stars in this feverishly perverse, campy and baroque freak-out. A wealthy playboy installs songbird "Black Rose" (Maruyama) in his elegant private men's club to bolster business - but he gets more than he bargains for when she attracts scores of homicidal past lovers, and not only he but his ne'er-do-well son end up falling for the femme fatale.
