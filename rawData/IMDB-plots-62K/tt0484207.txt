A philosophical caveman yearns for more out of life than sticks, stones and raw meat.
The hapless Ishbo, a philosophical caveman, yearns for more out of life than sticks, stones, and raw meat. Determined to single-handedly, advance the human race, Ishbo continually irritates his fellow Neanderthals with ridiculous inventions like the toothbrush, the spoon, and pants. The rest of his tribe, including his exasperated parents, write off his absurd gizmos and forward thinking ideas as the ravings of an idiot, something that doesn't help his efforts to impress the beautiful Fardart, the cave girl he loves from afar. Fardart only has eyes for Ishbo's studly but dimwitted brother, Thudnik. As if things couldn't get any worse, the enemy tribe on the other side of the hill is readying for war. Will Ishbo ever win Fardart's love? Can he possibly survive a man-eating wooly mammoth or a man-hating tribe of beautiful but deadly Amazons? Can he finally pull his species out of the primordial doldrums before he's history?
