The nephew of a librarian must go collect a 200 year old book, "The Book of Ulthar." that should have never been checked out by the Evil Count Orlock cause one of the spells in it could bring about the end of the world. During his trip to the castle, he meets Marissa, a gorgeous rock star and heir to the castle's fortune. There they must confront the only other heir to the fortune and the book, Uncle Byron; and Uncle Byron and his 3 adopted nieces all have very, very, very broad smiles.
Marissa Orlock [Teri Copley] and librarian Dexter Ward [Steve Altman] go to Transylvania, she to attend the funeral and will-reading of her dead father Count Orlock and he to retrieve a 200-year overdue book titled "The Book of All Evil." Also arriving at Castle Orlock is Marissa's uncle Lord Byron Orlock [Robert Vaugh], his three adopted daughters Patti, Maxine and Laverne, and Victor Van Helsing [Ace Mask], a friend of the family. What follows is a hodgepdge of events, i.e., Marissa I possesses Marissa II, Lord Byron et al are vampires, Daddy isn't really dead, and the overdue book must be destroyed so that the Lord of Evil isn't unleashed on the world.
