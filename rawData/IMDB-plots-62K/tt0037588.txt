An eccentric wealthy family facing bankruptcy schemes to steal an inheritance, but an alcoholic ex-actor they take in for Christmas charity complicates their plan.
A wealthy family is preparing for Christmas in their usual stylish fashion. They hit on a bright idea that will make them outstanding during this holiday season among their friends. They will adopt a "lost man" and bring him to their house for the holidays. They find a news story of a washed-up actor who has attempted to commit suicide and bring him to their home. The actor proves far more than they bargained for and he shows them some real truths about giving and living.
The family has a long lost cousin who is to inherit a fortune and they try to hide this information, hoping to gain the inheritance for themselves, by taking her to the family vacation home in the mountains. Their guest, the actor, discovers their plot and tries to reveal the truth through an amazing recital of the Scrooge story in Dicken's "A Christmas Carol".
