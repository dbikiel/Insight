THE SHIFT is the story of one 12 hour night shift in the ER where a veteran nurse, who struggles with the haunting guilt of his brother's drowning, is forced to train a new nurse. The veteran nurse, Kayle (Leonel Oliva), and the new nurse, Amanda (Casey Fitzgerald), are at odds throughout the story because, while they both struggle with the spiritual turmoil of what is right and wrong, they have both come to very different conclusions. Kayle, who was trained by Floyd (Danny Glover), believes in doing whatever is best for the patient, even if that means letting them rest in peace. Amanda believes you should fight for everyone until there is nothing left. While Kayle and Amanda take care of several patients that night, there is one patient, a young girl named Emily (Genesis Ochoa), who makes them question their beliefs. Emily is dying of cancer and has come to the ER due to another infection. The dichotomy of Emily's bravery and her mother's distress eats at the hearts of the two nurses. When Emily's situation suddenly becomes more serious, Kayle and Amanda are forced to make impossible decisions.
