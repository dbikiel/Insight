The Coyote is chasing the Roadrunner using a rather ingenious invention combining a fridge, a meat grinder, ice cubes, and skis.
In their first appearance in a Warner Bros. cartoon, the Coyote (Carnivorous vulgaris) and The Road Runner (Accelerati incredibulis) launch their neverending series of chases through the desert, and The Coyote begins his relationship with the Acme Corporation in his quest for the perfect Road Runner-catching device.
