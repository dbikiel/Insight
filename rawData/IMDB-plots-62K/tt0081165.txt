One long decade after the assassination of her husband, a reclusive queen comes face-to-face with the deceased's doppelgänger and anarchist poet, and strikes a three-day pact; however, fate has other plans. What is the mystery of Oberwald?
One long and painful decade after the brutal assassination of her husband, a reclusive queen comes face-to-face with the deceased's doppelgänger and fugitive anarchist poet, Sebastian, when he breaks into her ancestral castle in nineteenth-century Oberwald. In this dark and stormy night, bold Sebastian is bent on killing the grief-stricken aristocrat; however, the would-be assassin's striking resemblance to her late husband paves the way for an unexpected three-day pact, without turning him in to the police, and the ignoble Count of Foehn. Nevertheless, fate has other plans. What is the mystery of Oberwald?
A hunted man breaks into the castle at Oberwald to kill the Queen, but faints before doing so. He is Sebastian, the splitting image of the King who was assassinated on his wedding day. The Queen discovers that Sebastian once wrote a subversive poem that she liked, even though it was attacking her. The Queen dares Sebastian to kill her, otherwise she vows to kill him.
