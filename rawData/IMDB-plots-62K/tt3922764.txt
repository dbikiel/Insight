A struggling Liberian rubber plantation worker risks everything to discover a new life as a Yellow Cab driver in New York City.
In the Liberian countryside, Cisco's quiet life as a rubber plantation worker is disrupted by a workers' strike. Risking everything to embark on a new life, he accepts a chance invitation to New York, where he immerses himself in its small Liberian community. But when Cisco meets Jacob, a former Liberian child soldier, he is forced to confront his difficult past. The film is a modern twist on a classic immigrant story, shot on locations in Liberia and New York. "Out of My Hand" is only the second foreign-production narrative feature film ever shot in Liberia and the first to be made in association with Liberia Movie Union, an affiliate of Liberian government. The film was premiered in the Panorama section at Berlinale and won Grand Jury Prize at LA Film Festival in 2015.
