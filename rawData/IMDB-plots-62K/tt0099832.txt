Lottie Mason is a police vice cop who has just the right looks to be a decoy for the whore-mungers on the streets of Los Angeles. She seems to always be where the action is whether it be vice or drugs. While she is attempting to help Stan, the District Attorney, set-up a drug buy with a witness he needs for another case, they seem to have mutual attraction in each other. Lt. Joe Morgan has the hots for her, but she cant stand him.
In Los Angeles, Detective Lottie Mason works undercover as a whore on the streets or a junkie with the vice-squad leaded by the corrupt Lt. Joe Morgan giving support and arresting clients and drug dealers. She is also having sessions with a police psychologist for evaluation because she killed a criminal. She also has troubled relationships and high debts with her credit card. When she works with the District Attorney Stan, they feel attracted for each other and have an affair. After an assignment where she was almost killed, she has a flat tire while driving home. She goes to a bar to kill time while her car is fixed. Completely upset, she meets the charming criminal Tony Per√≥n that Stan is chasing, but unknown for her, and he offers a huge amount for her to go to his place. While in his fancy house, she regrets and tries to find a meas of escape. But she witnesses the execution of Tony, and she anonymously calls the police. In the house, she finds a key of a locker where there is a bag with one million dollars that Tony stole from drug dealers. While the police search the unknown woman, Lottie lives a dilemma about what to do with the money.
Regularly working alone undercover with a vice squad boss she dislikes as much as he dislikes her, Lottie Mason is living pretty much on the edge. An assignment helping out the Assistant D.A. may be the start of a serious relationship but then, tired and disillusioned after a job one night, she finds herself accepting a proposition in a bar that leads rapidly into a web of murder and deceit.
