The descendants of a witch hunting family and their close friends are stalked and killed by a mysterious entity.
Royal descendants feel the wrath of the curse of condemned witch Mad Dolly, who spews forth her prophecy while she is burned at the stake. The victims suffer death by having their heads removed in various fashions, getting their limbs caught in animal traps, knife wounds, and other methods of medieval torture.
