The story is about Commissioner Jordan who arrives in Marseille to combat drug trafficking activities in his own unique way.
Fed-up with the inefficiency of the Marseille police, Paris sends drug-enforcement specialist Philippe Jordan to Marseille. He's supposed to assist the local law enforcement dismantle the drug networks, especially mobster Sauveur Mecacci's network. So far, Mecacci has managed to elude capture or successful prosecution by local authorities. However, Inspector Philippe Jordan's unorthodox law enforcement style may prove efficient against Mecacci if Jordan receives a free-hand green-light from the Marseille police bosses and if he survives the frequent attempts against his life, of course. Once at work, Inspector Philippe Jordan's rough style creates mayhem in the city of Marseille and triggers numerous complaints from the Mayor's Office, from outraged citizens and from the lawyers of a scared Mecacci who wants to see Jordan dead. These things, in turn, tell Jordan he's on the right track.
