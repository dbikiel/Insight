Combining footage from interviews with the late great David Bowie and contributions from those who knew him personally, this documentary celebrates the illustrious life of one of the greatest artists to ever grace the stage.
Bowie is a legend - no doubt there. The story of his life is great, but could have been told better in this doc. Some interesting interviews, but disappointingly lacks in any actual Bowie music and uses repeated shots throughout. As a fan, was disappointed.
Some great insights here into Bowie's early influences - what drove him as a songwriter - but also some interesting observations as to what drove him as a performer. It concentrates heavily on the 'talking heads' style of documenting, but he's such an interesting character that it deserves to be seen.
Few musicians have pushed the boundaries quite as spectacularly as David Bowie. During a career spanning half a century, he was an innovator unlike any other. Until the last, David Bowie was capable of springing surprises. Releasing 'Blackstar' two days before his death saw him innovating until the end.
