Barbie tells on a new story, Thumbelina. A story about a fairy who befriend a human girl, and both cooperate their strength in an attempt to save the fairies trees.
In a modern retelling of Hans Christian Andersen's classic tale, Thumbelina (1994), Barbie recounts the exciting story of the tiny forest-sprite and her new best friend: the Twillerbee, Thumbelina. Living in total harmony with nature, the minuscule race of charismatic creatures has the extraordinary power to make plants and flowers grow; however, Thumbelina will see her world turn upside down when the spoiled girl, Makena, uproots her favourite spot of wild-flowers, on a whim. Now, a big construction company threatens to destroy the enchanted land of the harmless Twillerbees. Can the teeny-tiny Thumbelina save her beloved home?
