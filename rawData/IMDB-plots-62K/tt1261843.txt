A documentary following Kobe Bryant during one day during a game against the San Antonio Spurs.
For most of us, a day at the office is never accompanied by media interviews and roaring crowds. For Los Angeles Lakers superstar Kobe Bryant, though, this is just a routine part of his job. In the spring of 2008, with the Lakers set to face off against the San Antonio Spurs in a late-season game with major playoff implications, legendary filmmaker and conspicuous sports fan Spike Lee took the opportunity to show what its like for a top athlete like Kobe to go to work. With unprecedented access, Lee follows him from his arrival at the Staples Center through team meetings and pregame warm-ups, during the game itself, and at the end of his day as he, his wife, and his kids get in the car to drive home.
