A man is reunited with his childhood friend and her husband, who believe he knows the truth about the death of her rich aunt years earlier.
In 1928, young heiress Martha Ivers fails to run off with friend Sam Masterson, and is involved in fatal events. Years later, Sam returns to find Martha the power behind Iverstown and married to "good boy" Walter O'Neil, now district attorney. At first, Sam is more interested in displaced blonde Toni Marachek than in his boyhood friends, but they draw him into a convoluted web of plotting and cross-purposes.
In 1928, in Iverstown, heiress Martha Smith Ivers is caught by the police for the fourth time trying to runaway from home with her friend Sam Masterson. She hates her aunt Mrs. Ivers. While in her room with her tutor's son Walter O'Neil, Sam shows up. A heavy storm causes the power to turn off. Martha asks Sam to bring her cat back to the room. When Sam is trying to catch the cat in the dark, her aunt comes to the staircase and Sam hides himself. Mrs. Ivers hits the cat with her cane. Martha takes the cane to stop her aunt and strikes her, causing Mrs. Ivers to tumble down the stairs to her death. Martha lies to Mr. O'Neil and blames an intruder for killing her aunt and Walter confirms the lie. Eighteen years later, Sam is driving outside Iverstown, he does not pay attention in a curve and hits his car into a post. He brings his car to a body shop in the industrial town, and while waiting for the repair, he meets the gorgeous Toni Marachek. The next morning, Toni is arrested for violation of probation, so Sam decides to go to Walter O'Neil, now the district attorney and married to the wealthy Martha Ivers, to ask him to release Toni. When Walter sees Sam, he believes Sam wants to blackmail Martha and him, and his misunderstanding leads the former friends to tragic revelations about the fatal night and discloses dirty secrets about the couple Martha and Walter.
