Chip and Dale are worried about gathering enough acorns for the winter until park ranger Donald comes along with a bag full he's trying to plant.
It's October 7th and Chip is working industriously to store enough acorns in the tree for the winter. Dale would rather sleep in his matchbox, but an angry kick from Chip gets him working furiously. But there's only so much they can do. Their tree is nearly out of acorns. Luckily, the two semi-intelligible chipmunks happen to see the half-unintelligible Donald Duck, a park ranger, planting acorns. They immediately set to steal his bag of the precious nuts. Donald soon realizes what they are up to, and sets out a box propped up with a stick. It's a crude trap, with an acorn as bait; but it's not too crude to fool Dale, who upsets it and traps Chip. Soon, Donald finds he can have fun instigating a fight between these two quarrelsome chipmunks, but he underestimates their friendship and their ability to work as a team against a common enemy: in this case, a bad-tempered duck.
Chip and Dale can't find enough acorns for their winter supply. Then they see Donald with a bag full of acorns, planning to plant them. Chip and Dale steal the acorns and when Donald finds out, he tries to catch the two semi-intelligible squirrels.
Chip and Dale worry: gathering winter supplies is way behind schedule, so when park ranger Donald Duck arrives with a sack of acorns to reseed a forest area, they get busy stealing them. Their own temper and impetuous bumbling initially turn the raid into an amusing spectacle for Donald, but he soon finds they're even more tenacious and inventive, leading to a bitter battle for the fertile 'marbles' culminating in an improvised hockey match decided by stampede...
