Two sets of two college guys spend a spring break together in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. There they have lots of fun in and out of the sun.
Stu &amp; O.T. are two studs from the big city who arrive in Fort Lauderdale for spring break. They discover that the room they had reserved in an over crowded motel is already being occupied by Nelson &amp; Adam, a pair of college nerds. With no other accomodations available, Nelson &amp; Adam reluctantly agree to share the room with Stu &amp; O.T., who promise to show them a good time. The wet-T-shirt contests and beer-guzzling-fun are threatened when Nelson's controlling step-dad shows up, along with a building inspector who wants to shut down the motel.
