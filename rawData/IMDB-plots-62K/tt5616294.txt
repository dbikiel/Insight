A happily married professor, known for having many affairs with students, becomes the prime suspect when a young woman has gone missing.
Evan Birch is a family man and esteemed professor at a distinguished college, where his charm and reputation have made his philosophy class very popular. When a female student named Joyce goes missing, Evan's previous off-campus dalliances make his wife question his alibi. Gruff police Detective Malloy has even more reason to be suspicious when crucial evidence makes Evan the prime suspect in Joyce's disappearance. Suddenly, the questions Evan faces aren't merely academic - they're a matter of life or death.
The suave philosophy professor and loving family man, Evan Birch, is still trying to put the past behind him, and the hurtful experience that almost ruined his marriage several years earlier. However, the refined intellectual will find himself in a tight spot once again, when the popular high-school cheerleader, Joyce Bonner, goes missing, bringing the grizzled police detective, Malloy, literally on his doorstep. Little by little, minor slips of the tongue and strange inconsistencies in his statements will make Evan the prime suspect, putting to the test his already shaky alibi. But, is Evan really involved in the young girl's disappearance?
