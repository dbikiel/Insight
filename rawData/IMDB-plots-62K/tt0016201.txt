Street people Armand and Marie are madly in love, and she persuades Armand and other gang members to rob the home of Pierre Marcel, a wealthy scientist. The police break up the robbery but Pierre hides Armand from them because he kept a gang member from stabbing him, but Armand is wounded in doing so. When Armand regains his health, Pierre takes him around town and introduces him to many women, and Armand has no objections. Marie - jealous of the women - swears revenge on Marcel. They meet and he falls in love with her, and they are married while Armand is away in London. On their wedding night, Marie tells Marcel she is an Apache and her revenge is complete, and she rushes into Armand's arms. But another Apache, in love with Marie, wounds her with a gun shot.
