Instead, Tracy is betrayed, arrested, and imprisoned. But no jail can hold him for long. After making his escape, Tracy becomes the target of the largest manhunt in the history of North America. He seeks out Catherine who joins him in his flight, and their love deepens under the constant threat of capture. With hundreds of posses and national guardsmen on their heels, Tracy knows that time is running out-and when it does, there will only be two options: surrender or die...
