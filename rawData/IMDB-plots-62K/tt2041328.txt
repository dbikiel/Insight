A psycho girlfriend, Tracy, moves in with her boyfriend Scott and his two roommates, Cam and Dan, only to start targeting them when they get in the way of her plans for the perfect relationship.
For Cam Dawson and his two housemates, Scott and Dan, life is a constant party. There are no rules, no boundaries and, most importantly, no commitments past the morning after. It's a perfect living arrangement. Until Scott meets Tracy. While Cam tries to convince Scott he's making a huge mistake, Tracy stops at nothing for the perfect relationship and will get rid of anyone who stands in her way.
