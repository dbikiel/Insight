A failed film producer and an unemployed Chartered Accountant decide to make a 'sure flop' movie
A Bollywood producer-turned-petty thief, Raj Chopra (Paresh Rawal), who blames Subhash Ghai, Yash Chopra, Ronnie Screwvala, and others for his failures, and an unemployed Chartered Accountant, Anand Pawar (Kunal Khemu), cook up a scheme to attract 5 Crores each (50 million rupees) from 21 investors (a total of 105 Crores). Raj invests 5 Crores to make the worst possible movie 'Solay Se L'Gaan Tak', with the worst possible crew and actors, ensure that it has a storyline that is sure to fail at the box office, and pocket the remainder of the 100 Crores. All goes according to plan - but then Murphy's Law prevails - resulting in hilarious chaos.
