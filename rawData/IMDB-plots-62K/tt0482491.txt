Based on the true story of mother/son tag-team Sante Kimes and her offspring, Kenny, who crisscrossed the country and committed a string of crimes, among them robbery, fraud, arson, slavery, and murders that shocked the world.
Sante Kimes found a rich man, Ken, but he wasn't dumb enough to marry her. So her son Kenny Jr. isn't co-heir with his step-siblings. However the boy is made her accomplice in an endless series of shameless crimes, from shoplifting to elaborate scams. After her four year jail term, Kenny is unable to escape her clasp again. When his father dies, he's dragged along throughout the US as an 'enforcer' for even more daring crimes, as she's determined to avoid jail - by murdering dangerous witnesses.
