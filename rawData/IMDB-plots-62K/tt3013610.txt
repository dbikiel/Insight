Margherita, a director in the middle of an existential crisis, has to deal with the inevitable and still unacceptable loss of her mother.
These are hard days for Margherita, who is going through a very difficult period in her life. On a professional level first, the middle-aged film director, has started wondering whether the committed movies she has been making are really an actual reflection of the world she lives in ; on top of this, she is in conflict not only with her crew but also, and primarily, with Barry Huggins, a well-known American actor of Italian origin, who proves awfully bad and uncontrollable. On the personal level, things do not get any better - it could even be said they are worse. Margherita has just left her life partner and she has become unable to relate to her teenage daughter. As for her mother, she is now seriously ill and her doctor tries to prepare her brother and her for the worst. Which is unacceptable to the weakened woman who can find salvation only in denial of reality. Will she manage to face up to the facts and to come to terms with herself?
Utterly unprepared, the stressed-out filmmaker, Margherita, juggles her limited free time between the hospital and the movie set of her latest project--a political drama about a sit-in at a factory--while struggling to cope with her mother's imminent demise. Overcome with grief and insecurity, little by little, Margherita finds herself facing a mental breakdown and an ever-growing crisis, as her brother, Giovanni, on the other hand, seems to have already made peace with the inevitable. However, when everything around crumbles into dust, can one emerge unscathed?
Margherita is a director shooting a film with the famous American actor, Barry Huggins, who is quite a headache on set. Away from the shoot, Margherita tries to hold her life together, despite her mothers illness and her daughters adolescence.
