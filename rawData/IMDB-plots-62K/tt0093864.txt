Gildo (Paolo Villaggio) is a moralistic magistrate who shuts down red light districts but his enemies conspire to photograph him in a compromising position with sex goddess Lola (Serena Grandi). Laura Antonelli plays a wealthy woman who believes her husband has drowned. A priest is forced to put his mouth on a topless nun as the battle of morality verses misbehavior unfolds. A shy girl is forced to fall in love with a hefty; a priest falls in love with a nun; and a poor employee is forced to do menial jobs to his master for not being fired.
