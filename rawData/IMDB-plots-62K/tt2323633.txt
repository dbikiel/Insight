Boa is in great mood and wants to share it with Monkey. So he sends his best regard to her through Elephant.
Once, the Boa gave the Monkey greetings through his buddy Elephant. However, the Monkey is in a state of indignation. After all, she can not understand what it is. Perhaps she should turn to friends to understand the meaning of the word. Initially, she will address this question to the Parrot, and then to the Boa himself. After all, it turns out that it is not so easy to understand what such this thing is.
