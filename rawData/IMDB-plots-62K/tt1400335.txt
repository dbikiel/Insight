A foster boy is befriended by a lost dog who turns out to belong to the President of the United States. The boy decides to run away from the foster home to return the canine to the White House -- "Because it's the right thing to do!"
While US president Barrett opens a school bearing his name, his inseparable dog Teddy gets lost in the commotion when a gun is fired at its master. To avoid a press scandal, the matter is kept discrete. The dog wanders off to a country orphanage, where Teddy chooses as new master Danny Milbright, a shy boy who never seems to be considered for adoption but has a strong sense of justice, impelling him to return Teddy to his master. It proves an eventful journey all the way to D.C.
