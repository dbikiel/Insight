A man returns to his home town after serving a prison sentence for homicide, and finds that the details of the crime have been forgotten and replaced with local legends and rumors.
After serving time for murder, Josh Hutton returns to his home town where me meets Audry Hugo. No one can remember exactly what Josh did, but they are all wary of him, especially Audry's father.
Josh has been released from prison, serving time for murder. He returns to his home town. His crimes are exaggerated and no one is entirely sure how many people he has killed! Audry's father gives him a job as a mechanic ("Is he good?" - "Sooooo good!") and Audry falls for him. The Umbelievable Truth is a comedy which makes use of its wonderful (sorry!) dialogue.
