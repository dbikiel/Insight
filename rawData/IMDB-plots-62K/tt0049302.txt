During the Korean War retreat in 1951, a small British recon group is surrounded by Chinese troops and holds out in a lonely temple atop a hill.
In 1951, during the Korean War general retreat of United Nations Forces, a small British re-con platoon finds itself cut-off from the main British force.The platoon is led by Lieutenant Butler and Sergeant Payne. Corporals Ryker and Hodge are in charge of the men. After executing a search and destroy mission in an abandoned and booby-trapped South Korean village, the platoon heads toward rice fields, but finds itself surrounded by Chinese enemy troops. When sending for help becomes no option, Lieutenant Butler decides to closer investigate the isolated South Korean temple perched atop a steep hill. The temple seems to be a good defensible position for the platoon, but it's located at the top of the steep hill with only a sheer cliff to its rear.
