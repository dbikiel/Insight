Two journalists, Sandra and Marco, are sent to film a behind the scenes expose on a hardcore movie set. The set for the film is in the exact same location where, fifteen years before, Sandra's little sister was murdered by a serial killer called The Surgeon. Reluctant at first, Sandra will eventually face her fears by accepting the job, only to find herself involved in a new line of murders: who is the Surgeon copycat? And more important, why are his victims coming back to life only to kill again?
