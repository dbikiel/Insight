A woman writes a blog about her experience with terminal cancer.
In 2008 28-year old magazine editor Lisa Lynch and her husband of eighteen months Pete are planning a Stateside visit when Lisa discovers a lump on her breast. Friends do not think it serious but on doctor's advice she visits a specialist. She has cancer though it is believed to be operable with Lisa also undergoing chemotherapy, resulting in hair loss. Referring to the illness as The Bullsh*t Lisa starts an online journal, which she calls Alright Tit, and which her friends encourage her to turn into a public blog, writing about the cancer wittily and with no self-pity. In 2011 a second operation is required and Lisa passes away two years later, surrounded by the ever supportive Pete and her family. However her legacy is the blog, published in book form as The C-Word, which has given hope and comfort to many other cancer patients.
