A horny student killed in a car crash becomes a ghost who can make himself invisible or corporal at will. With the help of his perverted ghost guide, old uncle Pinky, he goes on sexcapades, takes on the principal and finds true love.
The only thing keeping Billy Batson from the girl of his dreams is one little condom -- or rather the lack of one. Lucky Billy finds one at an all-night roadhouse -- but speeding back to his girl, he is killed in a head-on collision with a truck. Now invisible, Billy must find his sweetheart and rekindle her fire -- but when he comes back to school as a ghost, his first stop is the girl's locker room, and he's beginning to "see" all the possibilities!
