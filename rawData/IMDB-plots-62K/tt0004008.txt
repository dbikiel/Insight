The cartoonist, Winsor McCay, brings the Dinosaurus back to life in the figure of his latest creation, Gertie the Dinosaur.
Winsor Z. McCay bets another cartoonist that he can animate a dinosaur. So he draws a big friendly herbivore called Gertie. Then he get into his own picture. Gertie walks through the picture, eats a tree, meets her creator, and takes him carefully on her back for a ride.
The cartoonists Winsor McCay and George McManus, the humorist Roy McCardell, and others are out for a joy ride when suddenly a tire goes flat. As the driver fixes it, the company visits a nearby museum. The skeleton of a dinosaur inspires an idea. McCay bets McManus that he can make the Dinosaurus live again. Six months and ten thousand drawings later, McCay is ready to win his bet. As the group dines, McCay presents his newest and most fantastic creation: Gertie the Dinosaur. Before the party's astonished eyes, the drawing of a prehistoric scene comes to life as Gertie emerges from a cave. Gertie dances, cries, eats a pumpkin, devours a large tree and more.
