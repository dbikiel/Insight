A recalcitrant thief vies with a duplicitous Mongol ruler for the hand of a beautiful princess.
A thief falls in love with the Caliph of Bagdad's daughter. The Caliph will give her hand to the suitor that brings back the rarest treasure after seven moons. The thief sets off on a magical journey while, unbeknownst to him, another suitor, the Prince of the Mongols, is not playing by the rules...
A young thief makes a good living picking pockets and stealing from merchants in the marketplace. When he sees the beautiful princess, the Caliph's daughter, he falls in love. She is soon to be married and that brings many suitors to Baghdad. Among them is the Mongol Prince who is intent on taking control of the city either by marriage or by force. The thief poses as a Prince and manages to win her heart. The Caliph however sends all suitors on a journey to find the greatest gift for the bride-to-be.
The thief will steal the gold from your purse; the food from your house; or the magic rope. Whatever he wants, he takes and he has decided to steal from the Caliph - until he sees the Princess. He loses his heart to her and disguises himself as Prince Ahmed - one of four royal suitors for her hand. When she picks him, he is overcome and confesses to his true nature which gets him flogged and thrown out of the palace. But he can yet win the Princess as all the suitors travel to find the rarest of treasures. His trip is fraught with danger as he competes against the magic carpet brought by the Prince of Persia, the magic crystal stolen by the Prince of India and the magic apple taken by the Mongol Prince - who desires the Princess and the city of Bagdad.
