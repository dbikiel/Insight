Delhi-based Rohan Sood lives a wealthy lifestyle along with his businessman dad, Shekhar, and mom, Renu. He attends St. Lawrence High School and is friendly with Vasu, Sudhir and Javed, and together the friends land in hot water virtually everyday. Then everything changes when he first sets eyes on heart-achingly beautiful new student, Ayesha Mehra, who was born in London, England, and also lives a wealthy lifestyle with her mom, Sheetal, and businessman dad. Both Rohan and Ayesha are attracted to each other and decide to go on a Karaoke date - with disastrous results as both end up in a vehicle accident. Their relationship sours with rumors of Ayesha being attracted to Shantanu and Rohan dating Simran, and both part ways. Ayesha and her mom decide to go to Paris to visit Parminder and her husband, Tony. Realizing that he now loves Ayesha, Rohan decides to travel to Paris, clear the misunderstanding, and win her over. In order to do this he misuses his dad's credit card to book an air-ticket, as well as forges school documents to show that he is attending the Math Olympiad. He does reach Paris but is unable to locate Ayesha. When he approaches the Indian Embassy, he is detained and may well be deported back home to possibly face his angry dad and school authorities.
