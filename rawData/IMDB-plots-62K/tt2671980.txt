Seventeen-year-old Sascha Naimann comes to Germany from Russia when she was ten. She's very smart - and particularly good at maths - but has more than the usual coming-of-age difficulties to deal with. She has only one goal in mind: She wants to kill her stepfather Vadim. She wants retribution for what he did to her and her family. He shot their mother before her and her two little siblings' eyes. Sascha lives in an ugly high-rise housing estate and has her very own way, with the trauma. So she goes promptly into the offensive when an article is published in the newspaper, which puts the murderer of her mother in a positive light. She writes the responsible editor in a rage. As a compensation, he offers his house as temporary residence, on which a triangle between Sascha, the journalist and his son Felix.
