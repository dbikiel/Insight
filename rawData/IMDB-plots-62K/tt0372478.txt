Watch the exploits of three young romantics as they dance around St. Petersburg, Russia, getting themselves involved in everything from a soccer riot to a rainstorm to a fight between best friends. Set in mostly real time, Olya, Alyosha and Petya act as if the world is their due and they live to enjoy every moment of it. A film alive with energy and a twist at the end that really twists, Progulka (The Stroll) is Alexei Uchitels's latest effort. His last film, His Wife's Diary, was submitted as Russia's Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Film of 2000.
