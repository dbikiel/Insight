Ã‰change tells the story of HENRIK, who takes part in a student exchange program with France. The only reason for this journey is to conquer the heart of his dream girl. Wild Partys, exciting trips, a crazy host family and of course his trouble with the French language turn the - at first unmeant - holidays into a memorable summer.
