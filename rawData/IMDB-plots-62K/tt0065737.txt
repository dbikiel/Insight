Reformed drug addict Tim Brett is holidaying in Italy with his aunt. When she is murdered, he tries to investigate, and soon his whole life is out of control.
A young British author is plunged into a nightmare as he tries to solve his aunt's murder in Italy. When threats of violence, mysterious notes and deadly phone calls shatter his life, the police and his girlfriend doubt the story due to his past as a drug addict - even though his life is in danger.
One-time heroin addict Tim Brett has kicked the habit with the help of his rich, widowed aunt, and, having written a best-selling autobiography which has made him famous, is taking a holiday in Italy with the aunt prior to getting married to his girl-friend, Juliet. When, abruptly, the aunt is murdered, the Italian police are baffled and ascribe the killing to a casual thief; but Tim, returning to England, begins to pick up on strange clues which suggest a conspiracy. When his flat is broken into, he finds himself being harassed, rather than helped, by police officers - who turn out not to be genuine - and then followed by a mysterious gentleman who claims to represent British Intelligence. Was Tim's aunt part of an elaborate criminal conspiracy? Are the spies who claim to need Tim's help any more genuine than those bogus cops? Tim begins to wonder if he isn't losing his mind.
