A pair of childhood friends spend a spring together before the summer Algeria's war of Independence.
A young Algerian paperboy with friends and associates of all ages on both sides of the conflict experiences history leading up to the March 1962 independence of Algeria, witnesses ruthless violence perpetrated by French and Arabs, sees his French friends depart or die, and tries to relate to his patriotic French soccer pal to the end.
