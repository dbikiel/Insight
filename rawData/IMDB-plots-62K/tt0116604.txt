Looking for the fast track out of suburban hell, two natural born losers scheme an impossible heist. Mick is slack, cynical, and most of all, unemployed. He masterminds the plan while Kev, angry and unemployed, gets the guns. Two undercover cops and a highly strung speed dealer are not far behind.
Idiot Box is a suburban tale, mainly about Mick and Kev, two unemployed mates who decide that there would be a lot more money for beer if they robbed a bank. Throughout the movie, we see them planning (with comical precision) the details of the haul. We also witness the life of a professional bank robber, and his heroin addicted wife, who in a very interesting way, wind up with Kev and Mick.
