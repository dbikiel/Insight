In the Canadian North Woods, Bugs is wanted dead or alive and Elmer is out to bring him in.
Mountie Elmer is on the trail of Bugs who's wanted dead or alive, "preferably dead". Elmer gets handcuffed to a bomb. Bugs looks through all Elmer's keys but can't seem to find the right one... Bugs foils Elmer with tricks like the Elmer-shaped snowman. Finally Bugs lets himself be arrested. Elmer takes Bugs back to the log stockade and puts Bugs up before a Mountie firing squad. But Bugs starts singing "Dixie". The stockade becomes a field of cotton, and all the Mounties, including Elmer, turn into singing Negro minstrels!
