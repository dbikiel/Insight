For the love of the beautiful Elena the young fisherman's son Marcello turns a whole village upside down.
Italy, 1956. In the picturesque island of Amatrello, a unique custom keeps the young men of the village busy: when a girl turns eighteen, every boy is invited to bring a gift for her first date. However the gift is not for the girl, but for the father... who will ultimately determine which boy takes her on her first rendez-vous! Eighteen-year-old fisherman's son Marcello doesn't care about this tradition until he sets eyes on the enchanting Elena, the daughter of the Mayor, who has returned to the island and - according to the tradition - has come of age. As time runs out and competition rises, Marcello comes up with the perfect gift for the Mayor. But getting that gift isn't easy... Soon, he is forced to barter with the entire village, as everyone seems to want something from someone else... Marcello's frantic quest ensues, evolving into a process of reconciliation among the village's inhabitants.
