A tribute to one of the world's great filmmakers and the men of the 8th Air Force who flew mission after suicidal mission in the Second World War.
In 1943, director William Wyler crafted 'Memphis Belle,' a tribute to the titular WWII bomber. Using footage from the National Archives shot by Wyler and his team, director Erik Nelson has created a new film, featuring narration from some of the last surviving B-17 pilots.
