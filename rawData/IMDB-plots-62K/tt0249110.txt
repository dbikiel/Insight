The life of Irwin Goodman, a Finnish singer.
Martti Suosalo transforms himself into Irwin Goodman, and takes us through the singer's life. Written by his longtime friend and manager Vexi Salmi, the movie is apparently as close to the real life of Irwin as we can get. In addition to being the story of Irwin, the movie also looks at the transformation of Finnish society from the post-war years to the 70s and 80s.
