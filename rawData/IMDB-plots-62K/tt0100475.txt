Parody of The Exorcist (1973), with Linda Blair once again possessed by Satan, and Leslie Nielsen as the exorcist.
It's been some time since Father Jebedaiah Mayii exorcised the devil from little Nancy Aglet, but now Nancy has grown up and has a family, the demon returns and repossesses Nancy. With Father Mayii unwilling to help, Father Luke Brophy tries his best to help Nancy, even when TV's Ernest Weller plans to air the exorcism live on TV.
A parody of "The Exorcist", the famous horror. The main female character plays a mother in a family now. She watch the TV all day, and the devil possesses her certainly. The modern devil chaser is Leslie Nielsen, who fights with the devil in a TV show.
