A wealthy couple marries their "unattractive" daughter to one of their farmhands, who ultimately becomes a celebrated aviator.
Cantinflas is a private, who doesn't know anything about discipline or following rules. He only wants to think about his girlfriend, the maid in an opulent hacienda. The owner has an ugly and shy daughter, who is in love with Cantinflas. The problems arrive when the family arrange a wedding between the ugly girl and Cantinflas, who in order to avoid the commitment causes himself an arrest. During the punishment, Cantinflas will learn to fly with a silly and not to much trained instructor.
