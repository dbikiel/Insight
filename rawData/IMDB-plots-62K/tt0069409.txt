Trinity and Sartana
The farcial, footloose misadventures of Trinity and Sartana as a pair of sharp-shooting Robin Hood-style con artists that repeatedly thwart the villains but never get to keep the loot for themselves.Trinity (because he comes from Trinidad) and Sartana have no relation to the actors that brought the titular monikers to fame, but this acts, rather, as a Spaghetti Western trying to carve out it's place in film cinema lore. This joke-a-minute, action packed tale of two friends who find ways to lose money as fast as they come into it is suitable for fans of westerns, comedies, and classic cinema.This was also released as just "Trinity and Sartana", and is difficult to find a version of the film other than the poor quality pan-and-scan released through Mill Creek.
