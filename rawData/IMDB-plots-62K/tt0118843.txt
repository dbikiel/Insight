A small time hustler gets more than he bargained for when he tries to repay his debts by marrying his son to a sister of a troublesome gangster.
Matko is a small time hustler, living by the river Danube with his 17 year old son Zare. After a failed business deal he owes money to the much more successful gangster Dadan. Dadan has a sister, Afrodita, that he desperately wants to see get married so they strike a deal: Zare is to marry her. But none of the two care much for an arranged marriage: Zare is in love with Ida, Afrodita is waiting for the man of her dreams.
Grga Pitic and Zarije Destanov are two old friends - and rivals - who haven't seen each other in years. But a series of events beyond their wildest dreams leads to a raucously funny reunion filled with gypsy mobsters, dirty deals and shotgun weddings.After Matko, Grga's low-life son, botches a train robbery and is double-crossed into debt, he is obliged to force his son into an arranged marriage to one of Zarije's kin. As the wedding day approaches - highlighted by the long anticipated reunion between Grga and Zarije - family and friends must cope with betrayals, lust, mishaps, death, farm animals and, ultimately, the pursuit of true love and enduring friendship.
