A fugitive Pink Lady rep hooks up with a bored ad exec as she's trying to avoid going down for the murder of several Elvis impersonators.
Harmony, a cosmetic saleslady who was born at an Elvis concert, finds her life linked to the legend. One day while driving, she accidentally kills some Elvis impersonators and flees the scene. She goes on the run from the FBI and joins up with a depressed executive.
The successful Pink Lady cosmetics saleswoman Harmony Jones, who uses lipsticks of her competitor to protect her lips, is very connected to Elvis Presley since she was seven years old and met him. She presently wishes to have a boy-friend and raise a family of her own, being lucky in business and unlucky in love. While traveling nearby Las Vegas, she accidentally kills three Elvis Presley impersonators, and she believes the police is chasing her. Meanwhile, she also meets Miles Taylor, who works in an advertising agency in New York, and is traveling to Las Vegas to finalize his divorce process with his former wife, Belinda. She wants her Elvis Presley clothes back as the final condition to sign the divorce papers. Harmony sees the clothes in Miles' hands and believing he is another Elvis impersonator, she avoids him, afraid of hurting him.
