A horny college freshman feigns being gay to be near the beautiful co-ed of his desires.
A typical Midwestern 18 year-old freshman at a large state university, eager to delve into the college party life, discovers instead that school is not the beer-driven, sexual fantasy of his imagination. Determined to do anything to obtain the girl of his dreams (a gorgeous but reluctant sorority girl), he decides to adopt a gay identity in order to insinuate himself in her life. This casual charade, however, quickly lands him in a morass of campus activism, gender warfare, fraternity hazes, sorority torture, "coming out" narratives, political martyrdom, and ultimately a university-wide meltdown.
