Trio of stories about lesbian couples in three different decades.
Semi-followup of the first "If These Walls Could Talk," with three segments set in the same house but with different occupants, spanning nearly 40 years. While the first film dealt with the topic of abortion, this deals with the topic of lesbianism.
1961: When Abby dies of a stroke, her surviving partner of 50 years, Edith, must silently face heartbreak and the denial of her status as "family" by the hospital and Abby's heirs. 1972: Feminist out college student Linda and her lesbian cohorts are ousted from the on-campus women's group--apparently, the cause of feminism comes first. Attempting to forget their troubles, the friends go to the town's only lesbian bar, where Linda meets Amy, who is too butch for Linda's friends. Intrigued, despite her friends' disapproval, Linda comes to understand and fall in love with Amy while learning about her own prejudices. 2000: Fran and Kal want to have a baby. But they want the baby to be theirs only, so to the sperm bank they go. But the decisions to be made. Ordering over the internet? Which donor? What race? What gender? And what if the sperm bank is out of that particular perfect donor? Above all, is it right to bring a baby into a world that will undoubtedly be prejudiced? Or will love and laughter see them through?
