The Tramp wanders into and disrupts the filming of a go-kart race.
Charlie, dressed as a tramp for the first time, goes to a baby-cart race in Venice, California. He causes a great deal of trouble and confusion, both on off the track (getting in the way of the cameraman) and on (interfering with the race). He succeeds in irritating both the participants and the public.
Charlie visits the Kid Auto Races at Venice, California. It's a big event with thousands of spectators along the track, where the kids compete with another in small cars. A film team is trying to capture the event, but whenever they put up the camera, Charlie walks around in front of it. The film director is irritated and tries to push Charlie aside, but Charlie comes back over and over again. In the end the director gets furious and kicks Charlie in his backside. Charlie revenges himself by making wry faces straight into the lens. Afterwards Charlie writes a letter to his girl friend, complaining that his picture didn't pass the censor.
