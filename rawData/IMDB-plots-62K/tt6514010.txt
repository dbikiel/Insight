A man fakes his own death. Unfortunately for him, starting a new life with a new identity will only bring him more problems.
Brij Mohan (36), a hosiery shop owner in a busy Delhi market, desperately wants to change his life. He is fed up of his ball-crusher wife and mounting debts. In order to escape his wretched life, he changes his appearance and adopts a new identity as Amar Sethi, but ends up committing a botched up murder. He runs off with his young girlfriend, hopeful of making a new beginning. Instead, as luck would have it, he finds himself trapped in a web of his own Karma.
