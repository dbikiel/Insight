Danni is the first Sposato daughter to marry; that is, if her three wild sisters don't first tear the family apart. Niki, Chrissy and Toni return home for the long overdue Italian-style family reunion, and quickly try to one-up the other.
In Rhode Island, in the Italian-American family Sposato, Danni is going to marry Geoffrey Brancato. Danni lives with her parents Santo and Irena and is the third and 'the good daughter' of her family. Her three sisters come for her wedding: the older Nikki, a successful TV starlet, who works in a TV show very similar to 'Baywatch'. Nikki brings her boy-friend and manager Marty Weinberg to be introduced to her family. Chrissy, who deals with investments in Wall Street; and the rebel younger Toni , who plays in a rock-and- roll band with her lesbian lover Amy Kayne. Together, they have meals in the restaurant of Tom Terranova, the former and first love of Nikki. Many discussions of the Sposato family show wounds not healed, when the characters expose their real feelings.
Three sisters return home for a fourth sisters wedding. One sister is a rocker, one a successful business woman on Wall Street and the other a successful actress. All the old baggage from the past comes to light just before the wedding in some pretty funny ways. It's a cute sister chick flick.
