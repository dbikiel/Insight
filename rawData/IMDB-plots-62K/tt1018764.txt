The Straw Hat Pirates received an advertisement on a recreational island. The offers all looked promising, so they sailed to the island for an opportunity to kick back and relax from their journey across the Grand Line. The site of the resort looks like a dream come true. Only our heroes find themselves greeted by the head of the island: Baron Omatsuri. He asks all 7 of them to compete in a series of contests for their granted relaxation. Luffy accepts the challenge, and they all find this island to be not so average. There is however a mystery shrouded on the recreational paradise. Such as why are the Straw Hat Pirates the only tourists around? And why is Baron hold the only flower of the island?
