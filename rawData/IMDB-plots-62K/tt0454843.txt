There are over 43 million hunters in the United States today. A great number of hunters...a great number of deer. Statistically something was bound to go wrong.
Bow hunting enthusiast Jack Hamberg, his eight-year old stepson Clint and former news cameraman Atticus Monroe are on a mission to make a deer hunting video. All that is needed to complete the video is a "kill". Jack and Atticus reluctantly decide to trespass onto a nearby property where there may be more abundant prey. Once inside the restricted area, they come upon some frightening realizations. The hunters have become the hunted. Only one comes out alive with the tapes that captured the horrific events that transpired on "The Hunt".
