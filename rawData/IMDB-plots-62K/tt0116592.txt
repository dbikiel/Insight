Prep school student Daisy and her European-born grandmother Nana share the sad stories of their lives: Daisy tells Nana of her romance with young Ethan and problems in school because she's Jewish; and Nana tells of her young years under Nazis when she was sent to ghetto and then to concentration camp.
English-raised young gentleman Ethan is his New York prep school's lacrosse captain and girls' dream prince. Yet he takes a romantic interest in Daisy, the silly-shy social misfit, whose rare only hobby is reading, while confiding in and relaxing only with her 'nana' (grandma), a Nazi concentration camp surviver. However Ethan's platonic romance stage patience runs out and Daisy can't cope with insensitive pranks at school.
