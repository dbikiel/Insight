A girl in the forest found a broken lily and brought it to her grandfather, who at that time thought about the horrors of the outbreak of World War I, and the broken lily reminds him of poor Belgium. In response to a granddaughter's request to tell a fairy tale - he tells her about the lily.
When a young girl finds a beautiful dead lily in the woods, she asks her grandfather to tell her about it. He tells her an allegory about the Lily of Belgium: The lily stands in splendor beside a stream, admired by the creatures of the woods. But an army of beetles, bent on conquering new territories, wants to cross the stream - and the lily is blocking their way.
