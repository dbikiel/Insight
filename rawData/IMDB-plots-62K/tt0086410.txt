This is one of my favorite movies.It's from writer Charles Bukowski, and two similar roles were in Barfly starring Mickey Rourke and the newest movie, based on working, drinking and women, Factotum starring Matt Dillon."Too beautiful" Serking said. "Like an angel from heaven who flew too close to the ground."In Tales of Ordinary Madness, Ben Gazzara plays Charles Serking an alcoholic aspiring writer who meets a beautiful prostitute named Cass played by Ornella Muti. He is back in the world of women, and quickly takes her back to his place to meet his ex-wife, current landlord, Vicky.He realizes his inability to find hapiness taming, Cass, the self mutilating, most beautiful woman in town, he therefore continues his relationship enabling her to continue turning tricks, he ends up traveling towards rock bottom, in a pit of alcoholism and depression."Ever heard one mouth screaming?
