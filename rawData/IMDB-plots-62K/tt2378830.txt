The 1992 Danish football team competes for the European Championship.
The Danish national soccer team's coach Richard Moller Nielsen battles a divided team that refuses to play by his tactics. No one save his wife understands his quirks and unorthodox methods, leaving the players and the national association, press and population shaking their heads. Star players quit the national team to focus on their champion clubs, making the coach the most maligned man in the country, and everything looks bleak for his seat as the team fails to qualify for the 1992 Euro Cup in Sweden. But UEFA disqualifies war-torn Yugoslavia from participating in the European championship, giving the Danes an unexpected chance to play. Out of shape, out of touch and up against the best soccer nations of Europe, only one man in Denmark now believes, that the Danish players can go all the way ... their coach.
