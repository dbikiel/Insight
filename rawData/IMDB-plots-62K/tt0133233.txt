Klaus Grahn is a young law student in his early twenties. He has a loyal and nice blonde girlfriend Anita, but is drawn towards a new love interest, the dark haired and more exciting Eija. Frustrated by his small earnings writing bits and pieces for a newspaper he gets the idea for a perfect crime. He forges a check and cashes it in a bank, but the money runs out and now the police are after him. Desperate he boards a train to Tampere and robs a taxi there and shoots the driver with his sawn-off rifle. Getting back to Helsinki he succeeds in avoiding the police who have come to meet him at the train station. He contacts both his girlfriends, who still do not know of the killing. Anita tries to talk some sense to him but fails. Eija tries to comfort him with he loving feelings. After drinking in a bar, Klaus runs amok through the city. He thinks he has been turned in to the police by the girls. He confronts them for the last time - with the gun in his hands.
