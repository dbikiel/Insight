Special agent Vogel is sent to an isolated town in a remote mountain valley to investigate the case of a sixteen years old's disappearance.
On her way to church in the hazy alpine village of Avechot, the quiet 15-year-old, Anna Lou, daughter of a religious couple, vanishes into thin air, never to return home. To aid in the investigation of this puzzling case is summoned the fastidious Detective Vogel with the questionable methods; however, amidst a full-scale media storm and half-baked leads, no one is above suspicion, villagers and newcomers alike. But is Anna Lou's troubling disappearance a case of an adolescent tantrum only days before Christmas, or is there a wolf in sheep's clothing, hiding in the otherwise peaceful community?
