J.R. is a typical Italian-American on the streets of New York. When he gets involved with a local girl, he decides to get married and settle down, but when he learns that she was once raped, he cannot handle it. More explicitly linked with Catholic guilt than Scorsese's later work, we see what happens to J.R. when his religious guilt catches up with him.
J.R. likes to say that he is "between jobs" as he hangs out and carouses with his friends on the streets of New York City, he not truly looking for anything else to do. He grew up Catholic, with those Catholic beliefs still what he likes to believe drives him. His focus changes from his friends when he meets a young woman on the Staten Island Ferry, she who rides the ferry just for something to do. His friends can tell and don't like that she is now preoccupying his thoughts. The two of them end up falling in love with each other. Although he wants to, he decides not to have sex with her until after they're married, as he only considers virgins to be wife material. Conversely, he negatively refers to unmarried women who have had sex "broads", with who he nonetheless has previously hooked up. Ultimately, she tells him of an incident from her past that was outside of her control. Not only the information of the story but his reaction to it leads to the question whether love is enough on either side for them to enter into a truly committed relationship that both truly want under the circumstances.
