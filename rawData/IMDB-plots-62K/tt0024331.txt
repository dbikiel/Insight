Mickey Mouse and his friends perform "Uncle Tom's Cabin."
Mickey Mouse and his friends perform the play 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' for a packed house. The gang dresses for their roles backstage, then Mickey and Minnie Mouse go on to enthusiastic applause. Horace Horsecollar is met with similar enthusiasm in his role as Simon, but the audience turns on him by throwing produce at the stage when the actor portrays the villain too convincingly. In the next scene, Clarabelle Cow plays Eliza crossing the ice while Goofy and the rest of the troupe create storm effects backstage. Various dogs are dressed in bloodhound costumes to "chase" Eliza, but when the pups find a cat in their midst, they chase it instead, wreaking havoc on the theater.
