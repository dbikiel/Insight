There are top secret plans of turning Denmark into EEC/EU's "holiday park". The Olsen gang plans to steal and sell the plans at DEM10,000,000. After being double-crossed, will patriotism win?
Some criminal EU ministers plan to turn Denmark into a gigantic fair ground and holiday paradise. Egon gets his hands on some important documents which could both make them rich and save Denmark's future.
For once Egon is released from prison without a plan. Luckily Benny has a plan which Egon messes up in order to get thrown back in jail. This lets him get the information he needs for his next brilliant plan. The gang steal the plans for Daisy-Land, a plot to turn Denmark into a recreational area for the rest of Europe. Egon gets tied to the face of the clock on the tower of Copenhagen city hall, and is left to the mercy of the hands of time, unless Benny and Kjeld can save him.
