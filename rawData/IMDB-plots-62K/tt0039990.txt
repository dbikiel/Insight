Donald is travelling the countryside and decides to rest for the night. He refuses to stay at the motel because of its $16 fee so he sets up camp in a woodland area. First he has problems blowing up the air mattress, then by a troublesome boulder, and finally after the air mattress is blown up, it deflates sending Don riding through the air back to the motel where it is presumed he changed his mind and slept there for the night and must pay the $16.
