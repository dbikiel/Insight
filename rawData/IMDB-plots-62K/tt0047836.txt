After the Civil War, government envoys organize a cattle drive from Texas to Kansas but Mexican bandits and Apache renegades plan to steal the cattle and a secret shipment of Henry repeating rifles.
Just after the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln asks two former enemies--a Union officer and a former Confederate--to drive a herd of cattle from Texas to Kansas, to help feed civilians who are short of food. The journey is complicated by marauding Apache Indians and a gang of Mexican bandits who want the new Henry repeating rifles that the drovers will be carrying.
