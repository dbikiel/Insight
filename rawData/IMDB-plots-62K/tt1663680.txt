Five strangers with nothing in common are forced to come together at a remote roadside eatery because of a road closure. They place their orders with the diner's omniscient owner, who seems to know everything about them... and claims he is Jesus.
Five strangers are forced to re-examine their life choices after finding themselves stranded at a mysterious, isolated diner with a man who somehow has all of the answers to their most pressing problems. From the callous businessman (Steve "Sting" Borden) to the unhappily married couple, the desperate runaway, and the solitary woman, each of these lost souls faces an existential dilemma that has thrown their lives into chaos. But the proprietor of the restaurant, a man named Nazerine (Bruce Marchiano), possesses the secret to freeing them all from an eternity of suffering, if they could only see outside of themselves long enough to understand just what's at stake.
