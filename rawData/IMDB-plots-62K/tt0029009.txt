Just after Kramer goes to Wyoming to start his protection racket, cowboy actor Jeff Carson finishes a picture and goes camping. Attracted to Joyce Butler, he hires on at her ranch and quickly gets caught up in Butler's conflict with Kramer. When the Butlers refuse to buy his service, he has their cattle stampeded.
When the law gets too close in their eastern city of operations, gang-leader "Doc" Kramer moves them all west to Wyoming and starts an extortion racket against the cattlemen. Jeffrey Carson, a western movie star, is about to leave the area when his friend, G. Gadsby Holmes, a Hollywood film writer, shows up on the lam from a divorce action, and persuades Carson to stay on and go hunting until it cools down for him in Hollywood. It isn't long before Carson finds himself fighting on the behalf of local rancher Violet Butler, and her niece, Betty, against the Kramer gangsters.
