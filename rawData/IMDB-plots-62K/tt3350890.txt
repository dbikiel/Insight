While researching an urban legend on feral children, three friends find themselves trapped in an abandoned high school, where they are confronted with an evil more sinister than the legend itself.
Ever wonder what humans are capable of when pushed to the brink of death? In the abandoned town of Freedom, Florida, such a question is being answered as an ever-rotating group of hitchhikers and lost travelers are being put in situations that test their will to survive. BECK (Bobby Campo), CANDICE (Mariah Bonner), and JIMINEY (Dave Davis) take a road trip into this isolated town to research the legend of feral children for a new graphic novel. As they interview the few residents living on the outskirts of town, they ignore all warnings to "leave before they become part of the story", and are captured by the reclusive psychopath, RUNYAN. Starved for the purpose of entertainment and revenge, our three travelers find themselves in a situation pulled right from their darkest nightmares. They are forced to fight and kill other captives to earn their next meal. When our heroes think they've seen the deepest pit of inhumanity, they discover that Runyan is just a pawn in a bigger, deadlier game. He's controlled by a sadistic caretaker who hides in the shadows, barking unthinkable demands for reasons only he knows. Can family members and loved ones withstand the evil temptations? Or will the pressure get the best of them as they battle one another for the right to live? "STARVE" takes a disturbing look at the deprivations humans are willing to endure for survival...
