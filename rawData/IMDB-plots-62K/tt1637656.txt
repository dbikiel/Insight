Strawberry Fields is the story of two sisters who both like the same man but in different ways and is a bold and inventive melodrama that offers a distinctively refreshing spin on a complex story of lust, rivalry and liberation. A seemingly carefree woman is seen cycling through narrow lanes before reaching a strawberry farm where she takes on a job, living in a shabby caravan, starting to develop friendships with her co-workers and in particular one rugged farmhand, Kev. Although aloof and mysterious it's not until a dazzling woman appears in the strawberry fields that we discover who she was running away from - her sister, Emily. Emily is eccentric to the point of dangerous and it's not long before the two sisters form a battle of wills with Kev caught in the crossfire.
