A major league star who is on the verge of breaking a record, meets a singer and they get married, but they have different goals, so they separate, jeopardizing his opportunity in sports and the possibility of making up with his wife.
Darryl Palmer is a right fielder for the Atlanta Braves. He is a middling batter at 0.294 for the season thus far. He falls in love at first sight with Debby Huston when he sees her performing at the Limelight, a local club, she who dreams of pop music stardom, with the next step on that hopeful road being a record contract. Initially, Debby has no interest in Darryl whatsoever, but he eventually wears her down with his true affection for her, they eventually getting married. As he feels he has nothing else of substance to give her, how he shows his love for her is to be the best batter he can be, their first date which was predicated on he hitting two home runs in the next game, something he had never done before. As such, he continues to hit home run after another in providing this gift for Debby, while in return people begin to see Debby as his good luck charm. As Darryl's newfound hitting prowess is in large part the reason for the Braves' success - they marching toward the pennant and he himself on track to break Roger Maris' long standing record for most home runs in a season at sixty-one - Debby, despite loving Darryl with all her heart, begins to feel the pressure of always needing to be there for him, at the expense of her own life and career. The question becomes whether their relationship and marriage can withstand the pressure despite their love, Debby who wants Darryl to rely on himself, especially as she is offered that coveted record contract.
