Four filmmakers take their cameras into the Montana wilderness to document the mysterious inner workings of a young community with a giant secret.
In the summer of 2012, a group of four filmmakers receives a cryptic postcard from their friend, Nathaniel, who's been AWOL for more than three years. Despite the misgivings of one of the filmmakers, the group heads to Montana to answer Nathaniel's plea for help. With cameras rolling, the filmmakers set off to capture life inside what is either a harmless commune or something much more sinister. Once inside the community, the filmmakers document the inner workings of the group while earning the trust of members who resent their presence. Amidst the details of the group's simple lives in isolation, the filmmakers learn of an inexplicable bond shared by members of the group, witnessing a mysterious event that otherwise might have gone completely unnoticed.
