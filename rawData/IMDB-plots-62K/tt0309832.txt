Four prisoners find an ancient diary in the wall of their cell which might be the key to getting out.
In a penitentiary, four prisoners occupy a cell: Carrère, who used his company to commit a fraud and was betrayed by his wife; the drag Marcus and his protégée, the intellectually disabled Paquerette, who ate his six months sister; and the intellectual, Lassalle who killed his wife. One night, Carrère finds an ancient journal hidden in a hole in the wall of the cell. They realize that the book was written by Danvers in the beginning of the last century and is about black magic. They decide to read and use its content to escape from the prison, when they find the truth about Danvers' fate.
Four prisoners share a single cell: the domineering transvestite, Marcus; Marcus's idiot savant buddy, Paquerette, who will eat anything in sight including pocket watches, cockroaches, and his little sister; Lassalle, the intelligent librarian who murdered his wife; and Carrère, the new guy who was caught up in corporate fraud and is now focused on escaping. After a brick falls from the wall, the men discover the hidden journal of a 'Fountain of Youth'-obsessed serial killer who occupied the cell in the 1920s. Is this journal the secret to their escape? Or is there something much more sinister behind it?
