The film looks behind the fear, hype and politics that polarize people into emotionally charged pro-vaccine or anti-vaccine camps with no room for middle ground. Verite stories of individuals and their families, whose lives have been forever changed by vaccine choices, interwoven with interviews from leading experts in the field, will re-frame the vaccine debate and offer, for the first time, the opportunity to have a rational, scientific and factual discussion on how to create a more effective vaccine program in America today.
At a crossroads, society is asking questions about vaccine safety, but is confused on where to turn for answers. Governmental agencies and health regulatory bodies are charged with implementing and carrying out sound vaccine policy that will keep vaccination rates high and disease rates low. To accomplish this noble goal, has government gone too far in shielding the public from the possible side effects of vaccination? Shifting the focus from the controversial, vaccine induced autism theory, The Greater Good, will examine the cultural unwillingness to look at a failing system. This character driven documentary follows the highly dramatic and ever controversial story of vaccines -- where parenting meets modern medicine and individual rights collide with politics; all the time striving to offer parents, doctors and policy makers a safe space to actively listen and learn.
