Late autumn 1943. Wydra (Otter), a Polish partisan, catches an informer in a nearby village and brings him to his starving unit in the forest. A thrilling adventure finds desperate times calling for desperate measures in wartime...
It is late autumn 1943. A small sabotage team of the Resistance, ridden with disease and hunger, vegetates in the damp, autumnal woods, waiting for the next call to action. Their task is to coordinate difficult military actions, particularly the assassination of Nazis and their sympathisers. They are partisans devoted to special ops, only they are in need of some special operations themselves.
