In 1932, a modernizing U.S. Army orders the Cavalry to destroy its horses but some sympathetic cavalrymen, defying orders, steal the horses in order to save them from destruction, to the dismay of the top Army-brass.
A group of cavalry men defy orders to destroy hundreds of army horses. Having disobeyed a direct order, the men are pursued by the military, but now the bullets aren't just aimed at the horses.
Based on a true story. In 1932 some American soldiers risked their lives and career for the respect to the horses who fought with them in their battles. General MacArthur himself ordered the shooting of 509 healthy horses in order to prepare the army for a foreseeable wold war.
