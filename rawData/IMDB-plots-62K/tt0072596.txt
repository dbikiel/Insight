In New York City, a young black boy and Puerto Rican girl fall in love despite objections from each other's families.
Aaron and Angela, two young adults living in the Harlem ghetto of New York City, are deeply in love with each other. The only thing standing in the way of their love is their families. Aaron is black, while Angela is Puerto Rican, and neither family wants one of their own to associate with the others. As the pair rebel against the prejudices of their families, they soon find the conflict spreading out to their friends and neighbors, until the hatred threatens to spiral out of control.
Against all odds, two teenagers--one African-American and one Puerto Rican--fall in love and learn about life in NYC's Spanish Harlem (Josiah Howard, "Blaxploitation cinema: The Essential Reference Guide.")
