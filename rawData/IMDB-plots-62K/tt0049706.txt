During the Mau Mau Uprising in British Kenya in the 1950s, settler-hunter Ken Duffield is a hired guide for a lion hunting party but he also hopes to find the Mau Mau rebel who killed his family.
Wealthy eccentric Sir Vincent Brampton and his fiancée Linda Latham hire Ken Duffield to lead them on a jungle hunt. Duffield is looking for the murderer of his son; he gets the killer and Linda.
After his young son is killed by Kenyan Mau Mau rebels, professional hunter Ken Duffield agrees to take Sir Vincent Brampton and his young fiancée Linda Latham on a safari. His real goal however is to locate the Mau Mau and one in man particular, Jeroge, who used to work for him. Duffield will put them all in danger but so will Sir Vincent's obsession: to shoot a famed lion that no one else has yet managed to track down. As they continue up country closer and closer to rebel territory, they both get closer to achieving their goals. Sir Vincent is also oblivious to the growing affection between Duffield and Linda.
