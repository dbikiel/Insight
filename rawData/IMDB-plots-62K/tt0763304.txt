This is the story of Doogal (Daniel Tay), an adorable candy-loving mutt who goes on a mission to save the world. Doogal must prevent the evil sorcerer Zeebad (Jon Stewart) from freezing the Earth forever with the power of the three mysterious legendary diamonds. Joining Doogal on his big quest are pals Dylan (Jimmy Fallon), a guitar-playing rabbit, Ermintrude (Whoopi Goldberg), an opera-singing cow, and Brian (William H. Macy), a bashful snail. Hopping on a magic train, they travel over ice-capped mountains, navigate fiery pits of lava, and sail across vast oceans on the perilous journey of a lifetime. Along the way, they learn that the most powerful weapon of all is their friendship, which even Zeebad's magic cannot destroy.
Legend tells of three magic diamonds that, if in the wrong hands, can be united to create a force powerful enough to freeze the sun. When the evil sorcerer Zeebad (Jon Stewart) escapes from his ancient prison, he vows to exact revenge by deep-freezing the Earth forever. Determined to save the world, a fellowship of four unlikely heroes band together to foil Zeebad's villainous plot. Led by the candy-loving mutt Doogal (Daniel Tay), friends Dylan (Jimmy Fallon), Brian (William H. Macy), and Ermintrude (Whoopi Goldberg) embark on an epic adventure to save the world. In order to find the diamonds before Zeebad, they must climb icy mountains, navigate fiery pits of molten lava, sail across vast oceans, and pass through a booby-trapped temple guarded by an army of ninja skeleton warriors. Along the way, they learn that the most powerful weapon is their friendship, which even Zeebad's evil magic cannot destroy.
