She's just fallen in love with an artist she's met, she's going for a PhD, and has a job at the VA hospital, as well as in the reserves. She decides to upgrade her security rating, with an eye toward promotion, and during the interview, she tells the investigator that she is a lesbian. The army begins proceedings to discharge her.
