When ancient Sodom is doomed to destruction due to its people's corrupt ways, Lot is the only righteous man destined to be spared.
Recounts the story of the birth of the Jewish people and the advent of monotheism on the backdrop of the last week in history of the infamous city of Sodom, the entertainment, gambling, sex and corruption capital of biblical times. A close look reveals that the biblical reality is no different than our reality today. A jungle of wheeling and dealing where its every man for himself. The father of the nation extorts God to save Lot, his relative, the evil king of Sodom proves authority will corrupt even the one righteous man in the city, Lots Wife redefines opportunism, and even the angels assigned to do justice discover that scruples are of no consequence when the heat is on.
