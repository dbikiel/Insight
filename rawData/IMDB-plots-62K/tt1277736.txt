A filmed account of the Zaire 74 soul music festival, originally intended to be in concert with the famous Rumble in the Jungle bout in Kinshasa, Zaire in 1974.
In 1974, music producers, Hugh Masekela and Stewart Levine worked with the boxing promoter, Don King, to create a music festival in Africa to run concurrently with his championship boxing match he arranged with Muhammad Ali and George Foreman, aka "The Rumble in the Jungle," in Kinshasa, Zaire. However, due to an unforeseen delay due to Foreman injuring himself in training, it was decided that the music festival must still go on as scheduled. This film covers the preparation of that festival with both stage construction and the arrival of the participating musicians. When all is ready, the people of Zaire got to experience a musical event that Africa had never seen before with great African-American and local artists performing with verve and purpose, with the Godfather of Soul, James Brown, just the biggest star of this musical extravaganza.
Kinshasa, Zaire - 1974. South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela and record producer Stewart Levine partnered with boxing promoter Don King to launch 'Zaire 74' a three-day music festival to accompany 'The Rumble in the Jungle' heavyweight title fight between thirty-two-year-old boxing titan Muhammad Ali and reigning champion George Foreman. Foreman injured himself while training but the show proceeded as scheduled, with cameras capturing the unpredictable collision of risky business ventures, unwavering and competing commitments to vision, alongside highly personal notions of spiritual allegiance and black identity. Headlined by James Brown, featuring Miriam Makeba, Celia Cruz with the Fania All-Stars, B.B. King, Bill Withers, the Spinners, and the riveting performances of many others.
