Alice, an ambitious camgirl, wakes up one day to discover she's been replaced on her show with an exact replica of herself.
In Daniel Goldhaber and Isa Mazzei's paranoid horror thriller "Cam," an erotic webcam performer finds her followers stolen by a doppelganger who hijacks her channel, pushes the sexual envelope farther, and otherwise seems determined to destroy her life. Call it identity theft of a possibly supernatural kind.
