Two cross-town rival dance teams go head to head for the National Nationals Championship.
*When dance-talent Brandon's penniless mother moved for a job, he had to leave behind without actual goodbye his childhood love Jasmine from a wealthy family, who blames him. The star of a ballet school, Brandon constitutes a crew, eager to win fame and fortune in a competition, but lack of success is exhausting moral. Then ruthless entertainment entrepreneur Mary sets up a new competition, the National Nationals, with little prizes or budget, but irresistible media exposure. As both enter e-and make the cut, Brandon finds himself opposite Jasmine's crew, posing split loyalties as his jealous deputy has a crush on him, Jasmine remains vindictive. Ingrate Mary's son JT is charged with all the dirty jobs while she grabs the laurels, but he starts speaking up for fairness to the contestants and she exposes her meanness unaware the microphone is open.
