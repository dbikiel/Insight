The Pink Panther is chronically late for work due to over sleeping. So, he buys a cuckoo clock in hope that the cuckoo's chirps will wake him in ample time each morning. The cuckoo does exactly this, but the panther is so irate at being jolted awake that he tries to silence the cuckoo so that he can go back to sleep.
