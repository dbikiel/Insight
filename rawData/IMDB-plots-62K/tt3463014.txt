"Halam Geldi"(My Aunt has Arrived) does not just tell a story in the Greek village of Northern Cyprus, where the sounds of the Ezan is accompanied by the church bells, it also underlines a tradition in Anatolia; the drama of child brides. Three children in the village, three of them from Diyarbakir (Turkey), three of them at the age of thirteen, three of them imprisoned by their fate.
