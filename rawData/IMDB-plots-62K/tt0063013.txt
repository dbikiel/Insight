A married woman leaves her husband and zooms off on her motorcycle to see her lover.
Newly-married Rebecca leaves her husband's Alsatian bed on her prized motorbike - symbol of freedom and escape - to visit her lover in Heidelberg. En route she indulges in psychedelic reveries as she relives her changing relationship with the two men.
The newly married Rebecca leaves her husband, the school teacher Raymond, and drives her motorcycle to meet her lover Daniel in Heldelberg. While crossing Europe, she recalls some moments of Raymond's life and how she met Daniel at her father's bookstore and then in an inn.
It's been only two short months of marital life, and rebellious Rebecca suffocates already in her dull relationship with the down-to-earth and timid school teacher husband Raymond. As a result, without guilt nor remorse, Rebecca decides to leave him and their dreary bleak town, to be free and alive, and most importantly, close to her intellectual perfect lover Daniel in Heidelberg. As free-spirited Rebecca dashes into the endless and cold highways on the saddle of her brutal pitch-black Harley wearing nothing but her skin-tight leather jumpsuit, her mind wanders from lover to husband, reflecting on her relationships and erotic experiences. However, what does the future hold for the imperfect trio?
