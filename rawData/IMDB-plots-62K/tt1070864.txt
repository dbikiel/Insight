A classic Russian fairy tale about Alyonushka and her naughty brother turned into a goatling.
Once upon a time there lived sister Alyonushka and brother Ivanushka. They somehow went to the field to work, and on the way back Ivanushka wanted to drink water. He clung to one puddle in the shape of a hoof, but Alyonushka did not let him get drunk from it so that her brother would not turn into a foal. Then Ivanushka almost drank some water from a calf pool, but again in time Alyonushka took him away from it. But from the goat puddle the brother still got drunk and became a goat kid. The maiden grieved, but there is nothing to do, and they began to live as they lived.
