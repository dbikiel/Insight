Although free spirit Helen Bauer does not believe in marriage, she consents to marry Don, but his infidelities cause her to also take on a lover.
Commercial artist Helen Bauer believes marriage kills romance. She lives with advertising writer Don Peterson. He convinces her to marry him. He later carries on with client Peggy Smith; Helen takes up with Don's competitor Nick Malvyn. In the end, the couple agree to give marriage another chance.
No one in their social circle knows that talented graphic artist Helen Bauer and Don Peterson, who owns/operates his own small advertising firm, are not only dating, but are in love, he having a key to her apartment to come and go as he pleases. They have no intention to get married on Helen's want, she who doesn't believe in the institution in further believing that such a commitment stifles individual freedom and romance. While he goes along with that, Don actually does want to marry her. He is eventually able to convince her to get married, which they both see as a total commitment to each other in all aspects of their lives. When problems start to creep into their marriage, resentment and jealousy emerge on both sides. While they still love each other, they have to see if they can find the correct balance of being in love, wanting to be together, and having that freedom as individuals either in a relationship or in a marriage. Parallel to their story is that of their friends, married Hugo and Iris Van Hugh. Iris does whatever she can to make Hugh jealous in his neglect of her, while not realizing that Hugh is totally devoted to her even in that neglect.
