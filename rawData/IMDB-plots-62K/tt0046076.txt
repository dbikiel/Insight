A self-righteous missionary man seeks to save the soul of a former prostitute.
At a lonely military outpost on American Samoa, sticky heat alternates with torrential rain. A ship quarantine strands here Sadie Thompson, a "breezy dame" who sets the Marines afire... and self-righteous Mr. Davidson, powerful head of the Mission Board, who suspects Sadie is a fugitive from the notorious Emerald Club of Honolulu. Meanwhile, Sadie is courted by crude but good-hearted Marine Sgt. Phil O'Hara.
When the free-spirited Sadie Thompson arrives in American Samoa, temperatures rise especially among the Marines stationed there and Sgt. Phil O'Hara in particular. What was supposed to be a 2 hour stopover turns into a week's stay due to their ship being quarantined, problems begin. Alfred Davidson, full of religion and self-righteousness doesn't approve of Sadie. When he remembers that he'd see her in Honolulu's notorious Emerald Club during a police raid he'd organized, he wants her deported. His own lustful desires surface however and tragedy ensues.
Post-World War II, and Miss Sadie Thompson is heading to work in New Caledonia in the southwest Pacific Ocean. She is stranded on a rainy island, as a crew member on board the Orduna, the vessel she is travelling on, contracts typhus and the whole ship is put into quarantine. Sadie befriends a group of marines from an American outpost and is courted by Sergeant Phil O'Hara. He proposes that she move together with him to Sydney, Australia. However, the moralist and powerful Reverend Alfred Davidson recognizes her from the infamous Emerald Club in Honolulu, and forces her to return to San Francisco where she has a past that haunts her. Nevertheless no one can run away from themselves.
