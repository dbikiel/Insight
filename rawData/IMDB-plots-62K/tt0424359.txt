Les Blank's first feature-length documentary captures music and other events at Leon Russell's Oklahoma recording studio during a three-year period (1972-1974).
This film was not officially released in 1974 and shown only at non-profit institutions with Les Blank appearing in person. After Les Blank's death in 2013, Les'son Harrod Blank and Leon Russell came to an agreement to remaster and release the film. Janus Films and Criterion are currently distributing the film in North America.
