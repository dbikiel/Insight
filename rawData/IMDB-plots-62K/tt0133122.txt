Two businessmen are hired to steal secrets from a rival, and decide to use a beautiful, but volatile call girl to do so.
Maas and Hosaka are two large Corporations in the future world. They are fighting to get control over the best minds of the world. The best is Hiroshi and at the moment he is working for the Maas Corporation. Fox has accepted an offer to persuade Hiroshi to go over to the Hosaka Corporation. Sandii is a little Italian girl from Japan and she should be the way to get to Hiroshi. X is the man who should train Sandii to break Hiroshi's Heart. But if X falls in love with Sandii? And if the Hosaka Corporation breaks the agreement? And if Sandii is not a little Italian girl?
In the not-too-distant future, two New York businessmen plot to play two multinational rival corporations against each other, with a little help from a shady Italian street woman, to obtain an important Japanese businessman for the company they work at, only things are not always as they appear.
Manhattan in the not-too-distant future seems a lot like Tokyo. Two friends who live on the margin try for one big score. One is Fox, older, limping, philosophical. The other is X. They stand to make $100 million from Maas, a conglomerate, if they can steal the secrets of a genetics company, Hosaka, and its genius leader, Hitoshi. They enlist Sandii, a call girl, to fly to Merrekech, where Hosaka's laboratory is, to seduce Hitoshi. During the set up, X falls in love with Sandii; Fox is cynical about the relationship. She heads for Morocco; Maas is ready to wire $100 million to a Swiss bank account; X fears for Sandii's safety. Will it all work out?
