A modern, gothic tale of crime and redemption about an aging police officer from a small Ontario Mennonite town who hides a violent past until a local murder upsets the calm of his newly reformed life.
Walter is the chief of police in a small Ontario town that has its first murder victim, an attractive young woman who is found naked on the shores of the nearby lake. The woman isn't local and while the Ontario Provincial Police have taken the lead in the investigation, Walter assists where he can. The town is mostly a close-knit Mennonite community and Walter has recently returned to his church. He is also trying to deal with his own temper that led to a violent incident some months before. As the young woman is identified, it becomes apparent that Walter's former love interest may be lying.
When a young, unidentified woman is found dead by the lake -- the victim of a brutal and violent crime -- Walter, a retired small-town police officer (Peter Stormare), is called to the scene of the town's first murder investigation in decades.Haunted by his past, and hampered by the mistrust of the community and a state police officer overseeing the investigation, Walter sets out to solve the murder, complicated by his ex-lover (Jill Hennessey) and his suspicion of her current boyfriend. As he delves deeper into the crime, his newly-reformed life begins to unravel, threatening his relationship with Sam (Martha Plimpton) and intertwining itself within the investigation and possibly the murder itself.
