A true tale of love, liberty and scandal amongst the Edwardian artists' colony in Cornwall
The Newlyn School of artists flourished at the beginning of the 20th Century and the film focuses on the wild and bohemian Lamorna Group, which included Alfred Munnings and Laura and Harold Knight. The incendiary anti-Modernist Munnings, now regarded as one of Britain's most sought-after artists, is at the centre of the complex love triangle, involving aspiring artist Florence Carter-Wood and Gilbert Evans, the land agent in charge of the Lamorna Valley estate. True - and deeply moving - the story is played out against the timeless beauty of the Cornish coast, in the approaching shadow of The Great War.
A sweeping romance set at a bohemian artist colony on the picturesque coasts of pre-war England, SUMMER IN FEBRUARY is based on the true story of painter Sir Alfred Munnings and his blue-blood best friend Gilbert. Born into a working-class family, Munnings rises to become one of the premiere British artists of his time, winning the affection of aristocratic beauty Florence Carter-Wood. But when Gilbert falls for Florence as well, a love triangle emerges with tragic consequences.
