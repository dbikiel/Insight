John Walden, left home 20 years earlier and has been "passing" as white in a town where no one knew of his background. He returns home to take his now grown sister back with him so she too can live a life as a white woman. He even goes so far as to find her a suitable white man to marry. Unfortunately, she can not get over the young black man she left back home.
