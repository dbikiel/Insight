A woman from the low class desperately tries to get her daughter into the movies.
Film director Blasetti is looking for a little girl for his new movie. Along with other mothers, Maddelena takes her daugther to Cinecittà, hoping she'll be selected and become a star. She is ready to sacrifice anything for little Maria, even if her husband would prefer they save their little money for the rent, instead of paying teachers, hairdressers or bribes for her illusions.
From the slums of Rome, Maddalena Cecconi, a struggling working-class mother with aspirations of catapulting her five-year-old daughter Maria to the dazzling world of the silver screen, descends to the famous studios of Cinecittà after a casting call by director Blasetti for Rome's most beautiful girl. As a result, determined to help her daughter stand out from the hordes of the ambitious contestants, the worried mother will become willingly the prey of a motley crew of teachers and expert professionals, who all promise her assured results, of course, for the right amount of money. Before long, the family's poor savings are squandered here and there, nevertheless, is there really a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow for the most Bellissima?
