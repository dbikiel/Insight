Combining newsreel footage, still photographs, interviews, and analytical narration, this documentary focuses on the antifascist, anti-imperialist efforts of labor groups, peasants, and working-class soldiers to liberate Portugal from the control of the government of Antonio de Oliveira Salazar.
The documentary, from a radical view point, follows the evolution of the radical social movement following the April 24, 1974, military coup in Portugal: the appeal by leftist movements for armed action by the people, the role of the Armed Forces Movement (MFA), nationalization of banks, rural land and some companies, direct control of companies by the trade unions and workers' groups, inner fights between staff of some newspapers and radio stations, the independence of Angola, major strikes by trade unions, the declaration of state of siege, the counter-coup of November 25, 1975, and the political campaign for the election of the President of the Republic in 1976.
