A college professor attempts to salvage his personal and professional reputation by using a laboratory chimpanzee to prove that environment trumps heredity in behavioral development.
Professor Peter Boyd's engagement to the Dean's daughter is upset by the revelation that his father was a habitual convict. To prove the Dean's genetic theory of inherited traits as wrong, Boyd starts a 'secret' experiment. He borrows the science department's chimpanzee with the goal of showing that it is one's environment that affects your reaction to right and wrong.
Peter Boyd (Ronald Reagan), a college professor of psychology, is in love with Dr. Valerie Tillinghast, the college dean's daughter. Dean Tillinghast (Herbert Heyes), a firm believer in heredity, opposes their impending marriage on the grounds that Peter's father was a notorious criminal. Peter sets out to prove environment is more important than heredity by training the science department's chimpanzee in moral values. He take Bonzo (Bonzo) home and hires a pretty girl, Jane Linden (Diana Lynn), as a trainer/mother combination. Complications arise from having such a pretty "mother" in Professor Boyd's home and from the chimp's predilection for stealing jewelry.
Prof. Peter Boyd is engaged to brainy dean's daughter Valerie. But the Dean wants the engagement ended when he finds that Peter's father was a crook. To prove that environment is more important than heredity, Peter adopts lab chimp Bonzo and vows to "teach this monkey the difference between right and wrong." He hires young nursemaid Jane Linden to "mother" Bonzo; but will Valerie understand if she finds Jane about the house?
