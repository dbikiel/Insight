An inquisitive teenager pries into suspected dodgy dealings on her space station home - and ends up being sent down to Earth.
Zenon Car is a trouble-prone 13-year-old girl who, in the year 2049 AD, lives on a space station with the rest of her family. When she runs afoul of Parker Windom, the owner of the station, Zenon is determined to be "incorrigible", and as punishment is exiled to the worst place imaginable: The planet earth. After several painful weeks of adjustment to her new surroundings, Zenon enlists the aid of her earthbound pals to return to her "real" home with evidence that the "respectable" Mr. Windom is up to no good.
When Zenon is forced to leave the space station that is her home, banished to Earth after she gets into some trouble with Chief Windom, with the help of some 'earthlings', she searches for evidence that Windom is corrupt and a way to return home.
