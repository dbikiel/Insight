A father and son, both coroners, are pulled into a complex mystery while attempting to identify the body of a young woman, who was apparently harboring dark secrets.
While investigating the murder of a family, Sheriff Sheldon and his team are puzzled with the discovery of the body of a stranger buried in the basement that does not fit to the crime scene. He brings the corpse of the beautiful Jane Doe late night to the coroner Tommy Tilden and requests to have the cause of death until the next morning to have an answer to the press. Tommy's son and assistant Austin Tilden is ready to go to the movie theater with his girlfriend Emma, but he decides to stay to help his father in the autopsy. Along the stormy and tragic night, they disclose weird and creepy secrets about Jane Doe.
In the rife with evidence house of a brutally murdered couple, the Forensic crew find the body of an almost intact and exceptionally preserved young woman in her mid-twenties. Amid a huge media frenzy, Sheriff Sheldon enlists the help of the experienced coroner, Tommy Tilden, and his son, Austin, entrusting them with the emergency autopsy of this beautiful Jane Doe with the cloudy eyes. In high hopes of finishing early, Austin decides to stay with his father during the seemingly quiet night; however, the peat under the cryptic woman's fingernails, the severed tongue, and her completely shattered joints strongly imply that this will not be just another ordinary case. Without delay, the two coroners begin to work, only to plunge themselves deeper and deeper into a world of impossible occurrences and equally inexplicable findings. Then, in the dead of night, something eerily strange happens. Can they unearth pale Jane's morbid secret?
