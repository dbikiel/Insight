A security guard falls for a famous TV actress he is hired to protect while dealing with mobsters who want him to sell out his business to them.
Zoe Clairmont, star of the hit TV show "Sweet Angels", is being stalked by her ex-boyfriend, so she hires Night Eyes Security guard Will to protect her. Complicating matters are the schemes of her jealous co-star, business rivalry from a competing security agency hoping to put Night Eyes out of business, and the sexual attraction that inevitably builds between Zoe and Will.
