A girl finds herself shamed in her small rural town after being raped by a football player. Her boyfriend, her mother and her lawyer all try their best to protect her, but will the local high school put a stop to the harassment?
A young high school student is raped by a classmate. However, when word of the crime gets out, instead of condemning the rapist--a member of the school's championship football team--the other students jeer at and humiliate her, call her a "slut", accuse her of instigating the rape and pressure her to keep her mouth shut so the football team will still be able to play.
