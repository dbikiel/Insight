"Only Clouds..." is a film about eleven year old Maria, who has lost her little brother. Her mother disappears into her own sorrow, then Maria meets Jacob.
Eleven-year-old Maria loses her little brother to cancer. Her mother retreats into deep depression; her father attempts to keep the family emotionally afloat. Sent to her grandparents' home for the summer, Maria meets Jacob, also an eleven-year-old, but with a completely different attitude to life and loss - he is an outgoing, adventurous latch-key kid with wisdom way beyond his tender years. Their budding friendship helps Maria reach out to her mother so that they can mourn and heal together.
