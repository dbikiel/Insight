A pastor who's suffered a personal loss accepts a position in a town that believes in a Christmas miracle candle, which he strives to abolish.
Deep in the heart of the English countryside lies the enchanting village of Gladbury. Legend has it every twenty-five years an angel visits the village candlemaker and touches a single candle. Whoever lights this candle and prays before it receives a miracle on Christmas Eve, but in 1890, at the dawn of the electric age, this centuries old legend may come to an end. When David Richmond, a progressive young minister, arrives in Gladbury, the villagers discover a new formula for miracles: good deeds and acts of kindness. While David's quest to modernize Gladbury sets him at odds with the old world candlemaker, he finds an unlikely ally in the lovely skeptic, Emily Barstow. Now, the fiery candlemaker must fight to preserve the legacy of the Christmas Candle, but when the blessed candle goes missing, the miraculous and human collide in the most astonishing Christmas the village of Gladbury has ever seen.
A young minister brings electricity to an English village during the late 20th Century, threatening a local tradition involving a candle capable of delivering Christmas miracles. According to local legend, an angel visits the quaint hamlet of Gladbury every 25 years, touching a candle produced by the local candle-maker, and giving one lucky family a Christmas miracle. Now the year is 1890, and as Christmas approaches, youthful minster David Richmond (Hans Matheson) arrives in Gladbury convinced that the locals will embrace the convenience of electricity with open arms. Meanwhile, the tempestuous candle-maker sees electricity as a direct threat to his livelihood, and plots to ensure that the legend is preserved. When the one blessed candle disappears, however, the citizens of this quaint hamlet have a Christmas like none ever before..
