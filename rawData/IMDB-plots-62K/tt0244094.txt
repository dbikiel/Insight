Two people who have pledged never to fall in love again then discover each other in a gay bar.
Never Again is a romantic comedy about falling in love despite your better judgment. An exterminator and jazz pianist in the noble model of Gary Cooper and other '40's screen legends, Christopher is having a sexual identity crisis. He hasn't been able to perform with the young women he's been dating, and is looking for sexual inspiration. Grace, an administrator for Mentors of New York, sends her final child off to college and then realizes that she hasn't tended to her own needs in a very long time. When Christopher meets Grace at a gay bar, her best friends admonish her that it's not a good idea to start a heterosexual relationship with a man you meet in a gay bar. Through human insecurities and foibles, and the refreshing reminder that the Boomer generation is still very much sexually viable, Christopher and Grace defy the odds of it never happening again. In a real, meaningful and adult fashion, they fall in love.
