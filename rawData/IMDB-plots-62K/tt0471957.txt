A woman dulled with praise, Nelli is well on her way to Med-School thanks to her parents, but dreams of a career as a singer.
Nelli, a girl whos been subdued by praise, is on her way to medical school if her parents can help it, even though she daydreams about a career as a singer. If only she could come up with a demo that she could use to show her talent to the record companies.Sune, a beaten down kid from the projects, is a talented hip hop DJ whos afraid of women. To show his friends otherwise, he makes a bet that he can get Nelli in bed. His friends dont believe a looker like her would even spit Sunes way. But Nelli sees an opportunity to get herself a free demo.As they use each other, they fall for each other. Theres a lot of road to cover to meet halfway. The lady needs to learn to stop trying to please everyone. The tramp needs to learn to observe others in life as well as in art.Sunes friends have a barrel of fun with what goes down. But Nellis boyfriend and father arent at all pleased.Taking your own path is always a step into emptiness.
