A 14-year-old video enthusiast is so caught up in film fantasy that he can no longer relate to the real world, to such an extent that he commits murder and records an on-camera confession for his parents.
In Benny's Video, the 14-year old student Benny (Arno Frisch) spends his days at school palling around with his school mates, visiting the video arcade and watching scenes recorded by his video camera on the television monitor in his room. Benny's mother (Angela Winkler) seems to only be available to fill the refrigerator with microwaveable treats, and his father (Ulrich MÃ¼he) only seems to hand down cool fatherly advice. Benny's parents spend much time away leaving Benny on his own, which the young boy fills with watching a documentary film he made of a pig being slaughtered, beginning with being shot in the head with a captive bolt. One afternoon, Benny meets a young girl (Ingrid Stassner) in front of a video store and invites her home where they have pizza and milk, and watch videos. Benny shows the young girl the captive bolt that he stole when he made the video of the pig slaughter and the two youngsters dare each other to shoot. With the video camera recording everything, Benny shoots the young girl dead and hides her body in his closet as he makes a date with his buddy from school to go to a disco and sleep over. On his way home the next day, Benny goes to a barber and has his hair shorn off and after getting a lecture from his father about it, shows his parents the video of his killing the young girl. After discussing what has happened, his parents plan to take Benny away for a vacation and dispose of the dead body.
