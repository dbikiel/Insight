Under the Ottomans' reign of terror in early-1820s Greece, Papaflessas played a key role in the nation's uprising to gain its independence, until his heroic fall against the tyrants' brutal multitudes, on May 20, 1825.
The life and work of the hero of 1821 Papaflessas that during the liberation struggle of the Greeks against the Turks, urging the elders and the world to declare war !!. Up to the heroic battle of Maniaki in 1825, fighting the hordes of Egyptian Ibrahim. Papaflessas was the "soul burglar" of the Greek Revolution. A real story for the heroism and sacrifice of the Greeks for their homeland and their freedom.
Under the Turks' heavy thumb and the Ottomans' reign of terror in early-1820s Greece, the son of a klepht, fervent patriot and cleric, Gregorius Dikaeos Flessas, or Papaflessas, was the selfless revolutionary--who, in complete disregard for his own life--was arming the enslaved Greek "ragiades" with the will to fight for the cherished and long-awaited freedom. Ordained to the highest rank in the clergy, that of Archimandritis, Papaflessas was able to move freely in the region of Moldovlachia--and as a member of the secret organisation, Filiki Eteria--he played a key role in preparing the ground for a nation's imminent uprising to gain its independence. From the commencement of the revolution on March 25, 1821, to his heroic fall on May 20, 1825, in the Battle of Maniaki against Ibrahim Pasha's brutal multitudes, Papaflessas will always be remembered as a hero in the everlasting pantheon of Greece's immortals.
