Henry Matthews is an exceptionally talented young R&amp;B singer whose happy family life is disrupted when his father, a marine, is re-deployed to Afghanistan. Despite all the obstacles including losing the family home and being forced to move in with his grandfather who hates his music, Henry is inspired to enter a teen singing competition in the hopes of winning and escaping a world that is falling apart.
Henry Matthews is a troubled middle school age boy growing up in Alabama. His mother is a recovering addict and his father is a marine who shares his son's love of hip-hop music. When his dad is deployed to Afghanistan and his mom loses the house and they are forced to live with his abusive, racist grandfather, Henry's only solace is working with a local pastor to hone his singing/songwriting skills to enter a singing competition with a substantial cash prize that will solve the family's financial crisis just in time for his dad's return home.
