A suddenly single guy invites what he thinks is a perfect couple to move into his apartment, only to discover they quickly insert themselves into all aspects of his life.
Scott Teller's life is turned upside down when he meets Ryan and Mary, a seemingly perfect couple who move into his apartment and his life. He quickly becomes their third wheel. But when Scott meets the girl of his dreams in Leslie he believes that Ryan and Mary are intentionally sabotaging his chances with her because they desperately need him in their life to hold their dysfunctional relationship together.
Sophia Bush, star of One Tree Hill and Brandon Routh of "Superman Returns" star in Table For Three, a cautionary but very funny tale of what happens when you let a perfect couple into your life.
Brandon Routh is Scott, suddenly single and alone after his girlfriend dumps him during his marriage proposal and his roommate moves thousands of miles away.
But when he invites super-nice strangers Ryan and Mary (Sophia Bush of "One Tree Hill" and Jesse Bradford of "Bring It On") to share his apartment, they soon begin to intrude on every aspect of his life including his new relationship with the girl of his dreams (Jennifer Morrison of "House M.D.").
Is Scott just being paranoid or does this seemingly perfect couple' need a third wheel to keep them rolling?
