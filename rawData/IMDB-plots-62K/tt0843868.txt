A promising track star, 18 year old Jessie Brenner struggles with binge drinking during her freshman year of college.
As mother's girl, Jessie got good enough grades and track and field results to be the Brenner family's first going to college. But her immaturity soon allows addiction to alcohol in the Greek life, which her lewd dorm mate Shanna introduces her to, wrecking both college pursuits. She also wastes her virginity without asking questions, then dumps the dream prince for not being monogamous, only to become another party slut. Only musically gifted Colin is a good influence. Only after an Internat scandal, mother discovers the extent of Jessie's orgiastic debauchery.
