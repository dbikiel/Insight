A kaleidoscopic film portrait of Shelly Brown, a twenty-three year-old alienated urban misfit recently released from a psychiatric hospital.
An ordinary woman is seen in a therapy session apparently in a residential facility and appears to be near getting discharged by the counselor. We see various scenes from her life, particularly a number of brief relationships with men, various attempts at auditions for various roles in plays, both with questionable results. At the same time, we eventually find out that her mother is supposedly a good actress but had a falling out with her and that put this woman in a residential facility. The Director apparently to together with her lead star (whom she's known in real life from childhood), wrote up an in-depth biography of her character, and then interviewed her for ten hours prior to shooting the movie. All the dialogue in the movie is also improvised.
