Spencer, a struggling comedian and hypochondriac, is convinced that he's dying from a bizarre array of symptoms. Out of options and armed with a binder full of WebMD printouts, he flies cross-country to his quaint hometown in upstate New York to consult with his five childhood doctors in a single day, planning to take the red-eye back to L.A. that night without seeing any of his friends or family. The only exception is Jay- the sweet, emotionally repressed townie Spencer convinces to chauffeur him around. "5 Doctors" is the story of their increasingly disastrous day together, as Spencer is prodded, dilated, and biopsied into accepting that the cause of his symptoms and his reasons for coming home may be more complicated than he thought.
