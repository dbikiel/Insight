The drama about a woman that gets fired because of his pregnancy and deals with a difficult financial and familiar situation.
Life used to smile at Luciana Colacci. Well, she was not the wealthiest woman on earth, as she was only a worker in the local factory, but she had very good relationships with her friends, the people of her neighborhood and her fellow employees. And she was (almost) happily married to Stefano, a charmer with a nice sense of humor. But almost only... considering the fact that her partner was more interested in hanging out in cafes doing business that never succeeded than in supporting his wife. That almost perfect life unfortunately came to an end the day Luciana was abruptly fired. Her crime: being pregnant! A fateful day which marked the beginning of her slow descent into hell...
