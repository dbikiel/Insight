A comedy set in the world of European royalty.
Eugenia is the queen of an imaginary European country. When her husband dies, quite unexpectedly, the country is left without a king. According to the law, the new king needs to be married so that leaves out the eldest son. Her youngest son, Prince Arnaud is married to the lovely Armelle and they have two young children. They become the future rulers of the kingdom.
The king of a small Eastern European country is killed in a helicopter accident. His heir to the Crown, Prince Alban is ruled out by his mother, Queen Eug√©nia, because he is not married as he should be according to the charter of the kingdom. His younger brother, although rather irresponsible, will take his place, since he has a wife and since, incidentally, he is his mother's favorite. The trouble for the Queen is Arnaud's wife, Armelle, an awkward plain-looking speech therapist. Will this ugly duckling really be up to her royal task?
