Pauline is a 'little girl of 66 years old'. She is intellectually disabled and been cared after by her sister Martha. When Martha dies, her two younger sisters, Paulette and Cecile have to make a decision on the best place for Pauline to be looked after. Neither of them is ready to take care of her. Paulette has a shop to look after and Cecile has her Albert. But according to Martha's last will, her fortune will only be divided in three equal parts if one of the sisters looks after Pauline. If they decide to take her to an institution, Pauline will be the only heir.
Pauline is a person with cognitive disability, she has a simple and rather happy life with her older sister Martha, who takes care of her since their parents died. It's an assistive and very asymmetrical relation, Pauline is considered a child, despite her age of 66. Suddenly Martha dies and the two younger sisters have to think of how to face with the new situation. The "easy solution", to send Pauline to an institute, becomes impractical because of the clause of Martha's last will, her fortune will be divided in three equal parts only if one of the sisters will take care of Pauline. Pauline loves immensely her sister Paulette, her shop and all the bright colored stuff in it. Paulette has rude manners, she has her own life, the shop, the Operetta, but in her straight words and gestures in some way promotes the autonomy of the sister. You have to be able! The other sister has a relation with a "very elegant" man, much too elegant, there isn't space for Pauline in their narrow, suffocating relation. The time with Pauline has its difficulties, hence, and perhaps it's better to give up the heritage, the two sisters think at last. But the new situation for Paulette, who closes her shop, leads to new decisions, to new lives...
