A film crew ventures into the forest in search of the mythical 'Jersey Devil'.
Bristling with equipment, two enthusiastic local access cable TV producers recruit an assistant and venture into a forest in search of the mythical and horrifying Jersey Devil. Days later, only one of the trio emerges. He becomes the prime suspect in the disappearances of the other two. However, a local filmmaker examines extensive footage found at the scene and arrives at a different conclusion.
Fact or Fiction was an innocuous cable access show. Steven Avkast and Locus Wheeler were the hosts who had developed a near cult status among the local youth. In it's waning hour, they put on the "Jersey Devil" episode, a live broadcast featuring a journey to a remote location in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey. Two fans they met on the Internet, Rein Clackin and Jim Suerd were enlisted to help. The idea seemed harmless enough. What happened became known as the Jersey Devil murders. It took the Police two days to find the body parts. It took the coroner four days to put them back together...
Presented as a documentary, and using the footage of the victims to show the events "as they happened", the tale follows a documentary film-maker's investigation into the mysterious murders of three would-be television personalities in the lonely Pine Barrens of New Jersey, and the purported guilt or innocence of the man later arrested and convicted of the slayings.
