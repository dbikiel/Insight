At Christmas-time, a generally disliked out-of-work actor finds himself in debt for $900 to a local bookie, who threatens to start breaking bones if he doesn't pay. Knowing he won't get much sympathy, he tells his girlfriend that he needs money for an emergency abortion for his sister. Soon a bartender and a friendly bar customer starts hitting everyone up for the cash. Meanwhile everyone is roaming amongst Christmas parties and spreading the word. In the end, everyone meets back at the bar and only then does the actor's ploy stand revealed.
