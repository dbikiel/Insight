As the title would suggest, La Mort du Cygne (The Death of the Swan) is set in the high art world of ballet. In fact, it is the first full length motion picture set in this world. It is about a young dance student, Rose Souris, who nourishes an impassioned admiration for a star of the ballet, Miss Beaupre, and consequently will do anything to help her further herself. Called "Ballerina" internationally, La Mort du Cygne was remade by MGM as The Unfinished Dance (1947).
