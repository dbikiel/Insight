A very old crocodile is shunned by his family after eating one of them.
Suffering from a severe case of acute rheumatism, an ancient crocodile is no longer able to take care of himself, let alone hunt to stay alive. One day, in despair, really famished and at the end of his tether, the elderly member of the Nile's peaceful crocodile community resorts to a despicable act of pure cannibalism--a merciless deed that would banish him forever from his beloved place. And then, as the outcast swims in the wide open sea, he befriends a 12-legged octopus. But has the old glutton renounced his former self, or could this truly be the beginning of a real friendship?
