RUNNING WILD is a comedy/romance/western/road movie/coming of age story about LIZA (Zoe Worth) and ELI (Alden Ehrenreich), childhood friends with a disastrously dependent, sexual tension laden relationship. Back from their first winter break home from college, Liza and Eli run away together and embark on a road trip that doesn't really leave LA or go much of anywhere. Encountering blood, sex, bar mitzvah and a Dalmatian, Liza and Eli continue to tear each other apart or keep just running and running and running.
