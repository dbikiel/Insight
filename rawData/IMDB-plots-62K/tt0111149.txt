Three friends discover their new flatmate dead but loaded with cash.
Three friends in Edinburgh, Scotland, interview and select a new flatmate. He's hardly moved in than they discover him dead in his room. An ethical dilemma ensues when they discover that he possessed a large amount of cash. Things get worse as the men whose money it was search for it, and the three friends start to turn on each other.
Close friends and roommates Alex Law, David Stephens and Juliet Miller - a newspaper writer, accountant and physician respectively - are looking for a fourth to share their Edinburgh flat. They revel in the condescending and cruel manner they treat the people they interview as that fourth in their general feeling of superiority. On Juliet's suggestion, they settle on Hugo as their new roommate. Shortly after Hugo moves in, they discover him in his locked bedroom not only naked and dead, but with a suitcase full of money. Individually agreeing to varying degrees, they, after debating the matter, decide as a collective to hide Hugo's supposed suicide, disposing his body - not before dismembering him of important parts for Juliet to destroy using her medical access so that he can't be identified if the body is discovered - and any evidence of Hugo ever having been their roommate, they believing that a "f***-up" like him wouldn't have any friends or family, all done so that they can keep the money. Their plan has the potential to unravel if their assumption that no one would be looking for Hugo are incorrect and/or if the relationship between the three flatmates changes from one of BFFs to every man for himself in either self-interest and/or paranoia over the situation, real or imagined.
The new flatmate of three preexisting roommates turns up mysteriously dead but in possession of a large sum of money. When the roommates decide to keep it for themselves, their action sets in motion a destructive chain of events that spiral out of control.
