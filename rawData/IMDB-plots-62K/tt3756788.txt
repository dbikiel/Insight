A story that revolves around three sisters who live in their grandmother's home and the arrival of their thirteen-year-old half sister.
Three sisters live together in their late grandmother's house in the city of Kamakura. They have lived together since their dad left home for another woman and their mum imitated her husband by running off with another man. Sachi, 29, the oldest Koda sister, a nurse at the local hospital, acts as a substitute mother to Yoshino, 22, and Chika, 19. One day, the threesome learns of the death of their "traitor" father and it is only halfheartedly that they go to his funeral. But in Yamagata something unexpected happens: they meet their half-sister Suzu, 13, there and immediately fall for the spell of this exquisite young creature. Sensing that Yoko, her father's widow, will not be a fit guardian, Sachi invites Suzu to move in with them.
In the coastal town of Kamakura, the Koda sisters--the twenty-nine-year-old, Sachi; the twenty-two-year-old, Yoshino, and the nineteen-year-old, Chika--live together in their late grandmother's ancestral house, since their father left them to live with another woman, and their mother followed soon afterwards. And then, unexpectedly--after so many years--the sisters receive news of their unfaithful father's demise, and much to their surprise, they meet their unknown but lively thirteen-year-old half-sister, Suzu, at his funeral. Straight away, the girls know that there are so many things that unite them, and as a result, it's only natural that Suzu joins them in the family house. Will the arrival of the little sister mark the beginning of a better future and a new purpose in life?
