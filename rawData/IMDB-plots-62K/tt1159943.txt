Not only is In the Edges: The Grizzly Man Sessions a very well shot and compiled piece, but the process of scoring the film proves to be a fascinating one. Rather than commission a score in the traditional manner, Herzog brought in guitarists supreme Richard Thompson and Henry Kaiser, and asked them and their fellow musicians to essentially improvise a soundtrack to the film, to match its mood with music that would be both soulful and raw, melancholic and yet also vibrant. In The Edges features Henry Kaiser, Richard Thompson, Jim O'Rourke, Danielle DeGruttola, Damon Smith, John Hanes, and Werner Herzog. It also contains several clips from the film itself.
