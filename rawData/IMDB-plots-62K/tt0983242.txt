In the strangest of places, a lonely public lavatory attendant who dreams of romance will find excitement and perhaps love, when a chivalrous secret admirer keeps leaving flowers in her tip jar. But, what good is an invisible lover?
A single middle aged lady working as receptionist and cleaner in a public lavatory for men spends her time between chores reading "Happy Woman" and daydreaming about a loving partner. When an unknown man starts leaving flowers at her desk, she gets excited but also increasingly stressed out trying to figure out who is her secret admirer or, perhaps, the prankster.
Who would have thought that in the strangest of places, a lonely public lavatory attendant would find excitement--and perhaps--love? Dreaming of romance in her small cubicle, the unkempt cleaner will find a fragrant bouquet of flowers in her tiny tip jar, and much to her amazement, the same surprise will be waiting for her every single morning. Without a doubt, this must be the work of a chivalrous, yet timid secret admirer longing for companionship; however, what good is an invisible lover?
