An ancient tower, in which is seated the magician, occupies the centre of the stage. On either side of the tower is a statue. The magician waves his hands and the tower and both statues disappear. He then removes his coat and seats himself upon a chair. On one side of the chair, two figures, each an exact counterpart of himself, appear. On the other side a third figure, also an exact counterpart of himself, appears. The figures then run up the wall, one of them balancing itself upon the head of the magician, and the others stand on their heads in the palms of his hands. The figures are then turned into flags, which the magician waves and throws aside as he makes his exit.
