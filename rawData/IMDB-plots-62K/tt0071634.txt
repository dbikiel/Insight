Huckleberry Finn, a rambuctious boy adventurer chafing under the bonds of civilization, escapes his humdrum world and his selfish, plotting father by sailing a raft down the Mississippi River. Accompanying him is Jim, a slave running away from being sold. Together the two strike a bond of friendship that takes them through harrowing events and thrilling adventures.
In Hannibal, Missouri in the mid nineteenth century, young Huckleberry Finn and his guardians' slave, Jim, run away independently of each other but for the same reason. Huck's no good father is holding Huck for ransom, the only way Huck's guardians can come up with the money is to sell Jim to the slave traders. After leaving, Jim runs into Huck and they decide to travel together down the Mississippi River on a raft to the free state of Illinois where Jim can live free. They learn that the news around Hannibal is that Jim murdered Huck, so the two have no choice but to escape. On their travels, they run into one adventure after another, including run-ins with wealthy Colonel Grangeford and his unusual family, slave traders, and con men known as the King and Duke. But before they get to their final destination, Huck changes their collective plans for what he feels is the best for both.
