After losing her job, Jersey girl Stephanie Plum is broke. Needing a job she is told that her cousin, a bail bondsman, needs someone to help out in the office. But the only job openings he has are for skip tracers. She learns that Joe Morelli, a guy she knew intimately years ago, is one of the "skips". She eventually finds him but wasn't really prepared so he gets away. Another bounty hunter, Ranger, tries to teach her. Eventually she finds Morelli again, but he claims he is innocent of the crime he is accused of and he is trying to prove his innocence. Eventually Stephanie thinks he's telling the truth so she stakes out the person who can help him. She only finds herself in trouble and Morelli saves her. She tries to find someone who can prove his innocence, but the problem is that shortly after meeting with them they're killed or attacked.
A proud, born-and-bred Jersey girl, Stephanie, has plenty of attitude, even if she's been out of work for the last six months and just lost her car to a debt collector. Desperate for some fast cash, she turns to her last resort - convincing her sleazy cousin to give her a job at his bail bonding company as a recovery agent.Stephanie takes on the company's most notorious bail-jumper, former vice cop and murder suspect Joe Morelli - the same Joe Morelli who happened to break her heart in high school. Nabbing Joe would be satisfying payback and a hefty paycheck. But as Stephanie learns the ins and outs of the business from hunky colleague Ranger, she also realizes that the case against Joe isn't airtight. With a plethora of misadventures along the way, Stephanie's new job isn't nearly as easy as she thought.
