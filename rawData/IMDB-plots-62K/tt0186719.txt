Charlie (Gummersall), his sexy girlfriend (Jover), and his moronic best friend (Bailey) drink, drug, and self-destruct over the course of one day at Charlie's father home in Los Angeles.
A day-in-the-life of Charlie Fox, a brash young commercials director from a troubled, show-biz family. Accompanied by three friends--his unhappy girlfriend Paloma, his party-animal buddy Joe, and a vulnerable newcomer, Cassandra--Charlie rides an emotional rollercoaster all the way from a California dream to a contemporary tragedy.
