An 18th century London wench gets involved with the nobility.
London, 1783: Kitty, a saucy wench of the slums, meets the painter Gainsborough by stealing his shoes. He paints her as an "anonymous lady" who excites the interest of his noble friends, notably penniless Sir Hugh Marcy, who schemes to pass Kitty off as a genuine lady (a formidable task) and marry her off for financial gain. But Kitty has her own ideas about the uses of matrimony. Lots of decolletage.
In 1783 London, artist Thomas Gainsborough has just unveiled his latest portrait titled "The Anonymous Lady" to great aplomb, as much for the portrait as for the beauty of its unknown subject. In reality, she is a cockney tongued slum girl solely named Kitty. In addition to Tom, one person who does know her true background is Sir Hugh Marcy who was in Tom's studio the day Kitty sat for him. One of the many who falls in love with the portrait's subject is the elderly Fitzwilliam, the Duke of Malmunster, who previously let Hugh go from his position at the Foreign Office in favor of the Duke's nephew. With assistance from his continually inebriated aunt, Lady Susan Dowitt, Hugh carries out a plan: transform Kitty into a lady complete with a back story in order to marry the Duke. The purpose of this plan is twofold: for Kitty to be able to get Hugh his job back at the Foreign Office, and primarily for Hugh to exact revenge on the Duke for letting Hugh go in the first place. Following the transformation, Kitty will be known as Lady Kitty Gordon. Although Kitty agrees to the transformation, Kitty has a mind of her own and can only take so much training before breaking. But as the situation around Kitty, Hugh and Lady Susan changes, Kitty unilaterally changes the plan all for a singular purpose. Through it all, Kitty is hoping that one person will see what she's doing and in return do something about it, leading to her own true happiness. But Kitty's fantasy and reality may be two totally different things.
