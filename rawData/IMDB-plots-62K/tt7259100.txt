Three young people - Maxim, his brother Pyotr and his new girl Pauline - come to a godforsaken village, where they settle in an old abandoned ship with a very bad reputation among the locals. Suddenly, at night Polina disappears, and the brothers rush to her search. And when she returns as unexpectedly, strange things begin to happen around her. Maxim fears for the girl, and his brother has suspicions that it's - not Pauline.
