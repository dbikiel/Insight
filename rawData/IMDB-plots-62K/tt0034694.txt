After two years under German rule, a small Norwegian fishing village rises up and revolts against the occupying Nazis.
It's two years after the Nazi's invasion of Norway and in a small fishing village that is headquarters to 150 German soldiers, the 800 locals are stewing, waiting for a supply of arms so they can revolt. Leaders include Karen Stensgard, whose father is the town's doctor and not all that sure that an open revolt will accomplish much and whose brother has proven disloyal to Norway previously, and Gunnar Brogge, a fisherman who was planning to sail to England to fight but changed his mind on hearing of English arms being delivered. Although the Nazi's cruelty is evident, the townspeople bide their time, until one incident causes the stewpot to boil over.
In Nazi occupied Norway in 1942, the 800 residents of a small fishing village stage a revolt against the garrison of 150 crack Nazi troops. Up to this point, the villagers had contented themselves with small acts of sabotage, such as pouring kerosene in the fish at the local canning plant. When someone from a neighboring village arrives saying they had staged an armed revolt with weapons provided by the British, they too decide to stage an uprising, despite the great risks to all of them. Led by fisherman Gunnar Broge and Karen Stensgard, daughter of the village physician, they are advised by a British officer not to attack until all of the coastal villages have been armed. The humiliation and eviction from his home of the retired local school teacher and an attack on Karen Stargard, forces them into action.
