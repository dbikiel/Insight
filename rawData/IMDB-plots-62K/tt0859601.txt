Dakota is a young werewolf who discovers a way to halt her monthly transformations with medical means, and attempts to flee the pack where she lives, and make a new life for herself. But her attempts to have a "normal" life is complicated when the leader of her former pack, Michael, refuses to let her go, which results in Dakota forming an alliance with a group of would-be mob assassins under the thumb of a shady nightclub owner who agrees to team up to stop the werewolves.
