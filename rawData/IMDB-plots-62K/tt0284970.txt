A boy in his early teens develops a crush on a grown woman old enough to be his mother only to discover she is also attracted to him. Marion (Emmanuelle Bercot) is a headstrong and free-spirited woman in her early thirties who heads to the seacoast for a short vacation that coincides with the 13th birthday of her godson Benoit (Kevin Goffette). Benoit and his friends are just old enough to be enthralled with any conversation involving sex and Marion humors them by joining in their talks on the beach about the mysteries of women.
