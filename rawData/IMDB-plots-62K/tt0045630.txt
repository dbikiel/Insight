Two American divers are distracted by fair ladies and skulduggery while trying to salvage a gold ship off Jamaica.
Divers Brad and Tony arrive in Jamaica to attempt salvage of the "Lady Luck," sunk with all hands and a million in gold. They charter a boat, "American Beauty," skippered by attractive Terry McBride, but cannot find the ship. But there's more to the "Lady Luck" than meets the eye, and undersea skullduggery forms a counterpoint to Brad's romance with Terry, and Tony's with cabaret singer Venita.
Deep-sea divers Brad Carlton and Tony Bartlett are hired by Dwight Trevor to locate $1,000,000 in gold bullion sunk with the ship "Lady Luck." But, there's no trace of the ship because of a scheme between Trevor and the supposedly-missing captain of the ship. The "Lady Luck" is actually amid the ruins of a submerged city. Following and underseas earthquake, some menacing voodoo drums, and a whole lot of scheming and counter-scheming, the villains are disposed with, and the heroes get the girls.
