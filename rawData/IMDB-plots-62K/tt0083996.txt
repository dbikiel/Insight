Cruchot and his gendarmes from Saint-Tropez receive a highly responsible government mission - to ensure the safety of four young beautiful female gendarmes officers. In a few days they begin to be abducted by mysterious villains.
Cruchot's police office moves into a new building. They do not only get high tech equipment, but also four young female police officers to educate. All of them scramble to work with them -- and cause pure chaos while being distracted by the fine ladies. Then they get into real trouble when one after the other of their female colleagues is kidnapped.
