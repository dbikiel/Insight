A tough young boxer struggles to come out in England. Having travelled to London, from his smaller town, he meets and falls for a twenty-something music producer. But love doesn't come easy.
Craig is a rough kid in Blackpool, picking up cash as a bare-knuckle club fighter; he's also having a hard time accepting that he's gay. Outside a dance club, he meets Matt, a Londoner working for Kelvin, a shady but enterprising music producer. Matt's flatmate is a client, singer Paula Poptart, who's Matt's good friend but also insecure and needy as a performer. Craig comes down to London to join Matt, but this presents problems for Matt, who's had lots of blokes but never fallen in love. Matt's feelings, Kelvin's demands, Matt's dream to run a rock club, Paula's snits and jealousy, and Craig's lack of job skills combine to put Craig and Matt's relationship in jeopardy.
