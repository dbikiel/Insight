Christine (Alexandra Finder) is married to police officer Uwe (David Zimmerschied) and together with their little girl Clara (played by Pia and Chiara Kleemann) they live in a small town near the Dutch border. The couple are into infantile games such as arm wrestling and spraying each other with water and unfortunately the childish behavior doesn't stop there, as Uwe occasionally goes into fits of violent rage as if he still were a petulant child that didn't get his way. At the same time, Christine tries to raise Clara to love her father, by no means an easy task, though the protagonist herself seems to do so unconditionally.
The story of a young couple who live in a small town with their four-year-old daughter. The husband is so caught up in his work as a policeman that he gradually becomes increasingly alienated from his wife and daughter who become ever closer to one another as they discover the new town. It is only a matter of time before the conflicts within the family manifest themselves.
