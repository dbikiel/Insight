Teen girl Jules must deal with her budding sexuality, and the fact that some men and women want her adds to her confusion.
A girl who, in memory of her father, carries his male name, Giulio, lives in Venice with her mother, a rich, fat, in commensurable woman. As an adolescent, she had a lesbian experience with their housekeeper Lia, who also taught her to hate men, to be considered animal-like beings, from which a woman can not be hurt. Over the years she manages to escape that bond morbid and becomes engaged to college student Lorenzo, who was raised by a beautiful but corrupt governor and was too shy to touch her, but promised fidelity and security. However she wants to try to have a sexual relationship with a man before marriage.
