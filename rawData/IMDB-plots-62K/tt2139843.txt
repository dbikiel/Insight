Pregnant by music? Rachel, a young teenager from a fundamentalist Mormon community, believes in immaculate conception, while her fundamentally religious family regards her condition as an intolerable transgression. The search for the child's origins is a revelation for the 15-year-old.
In a Mormon community in Utah, the fifteen year-old Rachel Angela McKnight discovers that she is pregnant. She believes in Immaculate Conception by the music of a blue cassette tape that she had listened to in a cassette recorder. Her father and religious leader Paul blames her brother Mr. Will and expels him from home; he also arranges a marriage in the community for Rachel. However she decides to go to Las Vegas to seek out the father of her baby. She steals Paul's pickup truck and heads to Vegas, and Mr. Will that is sleeping in the trunk goes with her. They meet the skater Clyde and his friend, the musician Johnny and Clyde invites Rachel and Mr. Will to go with them in their van to the place where they live. Rachel and Clyde become romantically involved and Clyde offers to marry her. However Rachel wants to find the musician on the tape.
