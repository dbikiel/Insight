In the remote woods of Upstate New York, David and Clare Poe are attempting to live an idyllic life. However, their twin children's bizarre behavior might just tear the family apart.
Documents one family's descent into darkness, using a compilation of found home-made footage. In the remote woods of upstate New York, the Poe family lives a Norman Rockwell life. Perfect house. Perfect marriage. If only the children stopped stapling frogs to trees. Something is very wrong with Jack and Emily Poe, the ten-year old twins. And, to stop them, their parents must enter the nightmare of their minds. The only question is: who will survive the night?
Psychologist mom and over-eager Pastor dad have moved their twins to a remote house in the woods, where the kids are clearly going very, very wrong. The video camera that the parents constantly use to record their holidays (and horrors) is the viewer's only eye on what happens, giving a documentary feel to the movie, but lacking in supportive plot information. Each parent tries to approach the creepy kid problem from their own field and perspective, and the videoed holidays and diary entries show us the conflicts in their apparently wonderful marriage, as well as in their very opposed professions, though the film remains purposely ambiguous. The faux documentary approach is most certainly derived from the "The Blair Witch Project" school of filmmaking, so the characters are familiar, but the plot is open to the viewer's interpretation, planting this film in a very modern genre.
