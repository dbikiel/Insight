Kika, a cute cosmetologist, prepares Ramon for funeral when he revives. He proposes to the much older Kika who has his dad as lover. Did Ramon's dad murder his mom? What about the escaped rapist and the PSYCHOlogist video reporter?
Kika, a young cosmetologist, is called to the mansion of Nicolas, an American writer to make-up the corpse of his stepson, Ramon. Ramon, who is not dead, is revived by Kika's attentions and she then moves in with him. They might live happily ever after but first they have to cope with Kika's affair with Nicolas, the suspicious death of Ramon's mother and the intrusive gaze of tabloid-TV star and Ramon's ex-psychologist Andrea Scarface.
