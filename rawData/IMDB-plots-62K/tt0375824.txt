The wealthy Edward (Haywood) sparks to Anna (Mckenzie), the lead voice in a choir that's raising money for an upcoming trip to China. He donates money to her choir, and she agrees to sit for him for a series of still-life drawings. As Anna is drawn more into Edward's life, their relationship -- quite platonic -- nevertheless causes problems at home for Anna, who lives with David (Blabey), a frustrated artist.
