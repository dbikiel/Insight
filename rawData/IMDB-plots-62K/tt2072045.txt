What is the difference between us and pedophiles?
For the first time in history the tables have turned on men. In the past "Witch-Hunt" was associated with women but now it is associated with men. In an effort to protect our children society has started to isolate men. This documentary explores the pedophilia hysteria and how all men are viewed as potential pedophiles. How did society come to such a conclusion and what are the political and social consequences? Have men really become victims of modern sexism or is the increase in sexism justified? Are All Men Pedophiles?
We live in a society that condemns pedophiles, though biological instinct and world cultures throughout history suggest that an attraction to adolescents is as natural as it is unavoidable. The fashion industry on the one hand sexualizes ever-younger girls while those who act on these instincts are reviled. The apparent hypocrisy at the heart of society forces the question: What do we mean when we talk about Pedophilia? Are All Men Pedophiles?The documentary shows the differences that exist between non-pedophiles and pedophiles. It reveals the missing link between pedophiles and non-pedophiles, namely hebophiles.
Hebophilia is a sexual attraction to children in puberty (ages 12-17 years). Because the public does not know that word, they speak of pedophilia when in actual fact it is hebophilia.
The documentary contains interviews with experts as Dick Swaab (professor of neurobiology at the University of Amsterdam), Corine de Ruiter (professor of forensic psychology at the University of Maastricht), Josine Blok (professor of Ancient History) and Holland's largest sexual research centre, the Rutger WPF (World Population Foundation). There are also interviews with pedophiles and victims of pedophilia.
