A serial killer in Los Angeles celebrates Jack the Ripper's 100th birthday by committing similar murders and only one has a chance of stopping him.
A young doctor is suspected when a series of Jack the Ripper copycat killings is committed. However, when the doctor himself is murdered, his identical twin brother claims to have seen visions of the true killer.
Someone's emulating Jack the Ripper so the entire police force tries to find him. A young doctor who works in an inner city clinic sees that one of the persons who comes to the clinic is an old friend who is now a junkie. It seems she's pregnant and wants an abortion but the head of the clinic refuses to have it done. Later, he goes to see her and he finds another doctor from the clinic doing something to her. He assumes he's the ripper and runs off, but, the man catches him and kills him. The police assume he's the ripper and closes the case. But, as they place the body in the ambulance, another man comes walking by who looks like him. It turns out to be his twin brother. It seems he had a dream about his brother's death. When the psychiatrist consulting the police thinks he's telling the truth, he hypnotizes him and he reveals things that only a person with intimate knowledge could know. So they wonder if he could be the ripper. In the meantime, he tries to figure out what happened to his brother.
