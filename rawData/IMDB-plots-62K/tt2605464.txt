This film is based on the short story Gandasa (Punjabi Machete) which describe the tale of rivalry in Gujranwala between the Malik clan and Maula's clan. The film differs from the short story but it's core components are the same.
The Malik clan and Jutt clan are involved in a dispute. Maula Jutt the youngest of the Jutts is a young man who is interested only in the finer things of life and wrestling. When his father is murdered by Ranga of the Malik clan, Maula swears revenge at all costs, saying, "The murders will start only now, I will murder even those who are yet to be born who will become our enemies"
Maula's friend Raushan tries to calm down Maula and make him see reason however Maula will heed no reason. One by one Maula takes on the Malik clan and lays waste to them. He is aided by Baala, the buffalo cart driver who he befriends after Baala defends him when he is attacked by the Maliks.
The Malik clan are arrested and Maula is offered the chance to condemn them to execution but he spurns the opportunity saying he was coerced into testifying against them by his brothers. His reason for mercy is that unless he kills his enemies with his own hands he will not rest in peace.
