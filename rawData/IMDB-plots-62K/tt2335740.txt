A man comes in a boat to an island on the river Parana. It goes to a place where there was a house or perhaps a hamlet. Small signs of something old and lost: its native place. The presence of the man allows that materialized the things in the godforsaken place: ranches and tables, animals and canoes. He constructs, for living again, the space for the reunion. Soon, others come to the island: space, light, last beauty, bodies and words, they spill from the ground and the river. It is the reunion, fundamentally, with its dead father, whom it does not see from four years and of the one that does not remember the face. It is the reunion with its dears. With its dead persons and with its birds, with the musician of the river and with its pains.
