Two couples (played by Andrew Scott, Cillian Murphy, Eva Birthistle and Catherine Walker) appear to live in marital bliss until cracks begin to appear in both seemingly steady marriages. The film asks the question 'How well do any of us really know each other' and explores the ideas of love, lust, and family relationships.
