Mickey, Donald, and Goofy are cleaning a large clock. Among the complications: Mickey fights a sleeping stork that doesn't want to leave, Donald gets tangled up in the main-spring, and Goofy is inside the bell when the clock strikes four.
The clock-tower is getting a major cleaning. Donald soon characteristically looses his temper while cleaning the inner clockwork, when a resilient spring proves better at springing back then he at pushing and hammering it where it just won't fit. Mickey is in charge of the exterior plates, which is perilous enough, but soon must also try to save from a fatal fall Goofy, who ended up the sleep-walking loser of a shadow-fight against the automatically rotating bronze figures which ring the giant bell, which he managed to stand inside so the deafening drone totally shattered his sense of balance.
