The first film to ever show a nudity scene on screen is a simple presentation of a servant preparing a bath for another woman.
An elegantly dress woman and her maid servant enter a room which has a large basin on the floor. The maid immediately helps the woman disrobe giving modern viewers an idea of how many layers of clothing women wore in 1897. When the woman is down to her last garment she steps into the tub and the maid pours what appears to be black powder onto her back. She then covers the woman with a robe, pats her dry and the film ends.
Exhausted after a scintillating ball, an aristocratic and very fashionable Madame returns home craving for a warm bath before retiring. Without delay, the invaluable lady's maid helps her remove the voluminous ballroom gown, and layer after layer of fine 19th-century underwear, she finally exposes the belle's Rubenesque physique. In the end, in an act of simulated nudity which vividly portrays the beauty standards of the time, the maid pours warm water from a pitcher, finally covering the dame in a robe.
