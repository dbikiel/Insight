A SECOND KNOCK AT THE DOOR is an award-winning documentary that offers a rare glimpse into the lives of military families dealing with the loss of loved ones to friendly fire. Through interviews and investigative reports, this film explores key incidents that forced families of the fallen to embark on individual but integrally linked quests for the truth after the Army attempted to bury the truth within the "fog of war." Unwilling to allow these soldiers to be defined by their death, A SECOND KNOCK AT THE DOOR explores the men outside of their uniforms through the eyes of the communities that saw them not only as heroes but as sons, husbands, fathers, fianc√©s and friends.
