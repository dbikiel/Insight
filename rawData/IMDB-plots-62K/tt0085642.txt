An Israeli lawyer is defending a Palestinian charged by The Military Court System in the Israeli-Occupied Territories. It's a tough case because of a strong political background.
Hanna Kaufman is a Jewish-American, who moved to Israel and now works as a defense lawyer there. Her troubles start when she's court-appointed to defend Palestinian Salim Bakri, who's been arrested and charged by the military tribunal with belonging to a terrorist network. Bakri claims that he's an innocent victim of prosecution by the Israeli state, because he wants his family's property back. Hanna investigates his claims and realizes that he may not be lying. The prosecutor proposes a way to both get rid of Bakri and not give in to his demands. Hanna must decide whether to give in and possibly save her client's life or fight for what she, as the child of Holocaust survivors, believes to be right. This case takes a tall on her personal life as well.
