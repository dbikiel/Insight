A Roman Catholic priest leads a band of ten young men from various backgrounds on a pilgrimage. They walk from the south of France along the less popular Northern Route of the "Camino" to Santiago de Compostela in Northern Spain, a shrine built around the remains of Santiago, the Apostle St. James. Along the way through mountain pathways, inclement weather and blistered feet, the men learn valuable life lessons about commitment, perseverance, assistance and spirituality. "In order to succeed you only need to get up one more time than you fall."
