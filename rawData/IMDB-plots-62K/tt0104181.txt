A man becomes obsessed with vengeance when his soul mate marries another man.
Heathcliff is Cathy Earnshaw's foster brother; more than that, he is her other half. When forces within and without tear them apart, Heathcliff wreaks vengeance on those he holds responsible, even into a second generation.
The love that exists between Cathy and Heathcliff is told, that love which began upon first sight in the late eighteenth century when Cathy's father, Mr. Earnshaw, brought Heathcliff into their farmhouse called Wuthering Heights on the side of the English moors to live, when both Cathy and Heathcliff were adolescents. Mr. Earnshaw found Heathcliff, assumed to be orphaned, on the streets of Liverpool. Heathcliff's status as the favored one in the house changed upon Mr. Earnshaw's death, with the new head of household, Cathy's older brother Hindley relegating Heathcliff to the role of servant, most specifically stable boy, Heathcliff who was now banished to live in the stables as opposed to the house. Cathy and Heathcliff's want to be together in love, as they grew into young adulthood, was affected largely by meeting brother and sister Edgar and Isabella Linton who lived in nearby grand Thrushcross Grange, the Lintons who lived in a higher social class. The question as the years go on is whether Cathy and Heathcliff's love can endure against the obstacles which they and others have placed in front of them.
