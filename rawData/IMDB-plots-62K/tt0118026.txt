Leo and Marili grow up in a working class neighborhood in post world war one Munich in Germany. They make their first holy communion, fall in love for the first time, graduate from school and start working, bury a loved one for the first time in their lives, and generally try to get as much out of life as they can under the circumstances in the 1920s and 1930s, up until the first day of the second world war.
