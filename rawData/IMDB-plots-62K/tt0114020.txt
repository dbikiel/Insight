Sebastian is one of five youths who are always together. Suddenly he realizes that he is attracted to another boy (Ulf).
16 year old Sebastian behaves strangely. He stays alone in his room for hours thinking and doesn't talk to his parents as he used to. He refuses to explain to them what his problem is. The truth is that he slowly discovers that he feels stangely for his best friend Ulf. Soon he is going to accept his true self - that he is gay and that he is also in love with his best friend Ulf.
