Its style has been compared to Paranormal Activity and The Blair Witch Project and is being represented as "found footage, " but it is not "shaky-cam" like the headache-inducing The Last Exorcism, nor is it a "mockumentary" such as The Fourth Kind. The films content deals with the question, "What happened to the alien bodies that were recovered from the 1947 Roswell incident?" It not only asks this question, but also answers it with captured images that will shock and horrify the viewing audience in such a profound way that one will need to carefully reassess their beliefs in extraterrestrial life.
This multiple-award winning feature film is a must see for all sci-fi and horror fans as well as anyone who is on the fence about whether or not aliens actually exist.
