When a cunning, unscrupulous mobster is sentenced to a Florida prison farm, he launches a deadly escape plan.
New York gangster Bart Galvin (Richard Conte) is sent to a prison-farm in Florida for killing one of his enemies in Miami. Once there, he learns that, in the particular prison he is serving his sentence, "trustees" ate made to guard other prisoners ,and that, should a trustee actually shoot an escaping prisoner, the trustee is given his freedom. Being smart, Glavin quickly decides he had rather be a trustee instead of an other prisoner, via bribery he quickly becomes a trustee. He hatches an escape plan and, using a bribe of $25,000 , he sends prisoner Samuel Gower (Sam Jaffe), who has a starving wife and child, into the woods. Gower doesn't quite make the woods, as Galnin shoots him in the back before he gets very far. Galvin gets his freedom and heads for the border, but there is a determined sheriff, Bill Langley (John McIntire) who has heard of the deal through the prison grapevine...and he is on Galvin's tail.
