A young German boy faces the problems of the tough life in the immediate post WWII Berlin.
Edmund, a young boy who lives in war-devastated Germany after the Second World War has to do all kinds of work and tricks to help his family in getting food and barely survive. One day he meets a man who used to be one of his teachers in school and hopes to get support from him, but the ideas of this man do not lead Edmund in a clearer or safer way of living...
In 1947, an ordinary German family fights to survive in a wrecked Berlin after the end of World War II. The father is very sick, incapable to work and bring food home; his older son, Karl-Heinz, is a former soldier hiding from the police, afraid of the consequences of fighting in the war; his daughter Eva is waiting for her boyfriend Wolf and goes to clubs at night to bring valuable cigarettes and minor gifts to contribute to the survival of her family; and the twelve year old boy Edmund wanders through the devastated city trying to find work or some food to reduce the starvation of his family. When Edmund meets his former teacher, Herr Enning, he will be led to a desperate final solution.
Burdened with the difficult task of providing for his family in Allied-occupied post-World War II Berlin, the brave twelve-year-old, Edmund KÃ¶hler, scrapes by on whatever he can find in the war-battered streets. Undoubtedly, this is a great responsibility; however--with Edmund's father too sick to get out of bed, and his older ex-Nazi brother, Karl-Heinz, hiding from the authorities--inevitably, he is the family's only chance of survival. As a result, an innocent and desperate for food Edmund will soon have to accept his former teacher Herr Henning's risky proposition, who, secretly, seems to be still nostalgic of the old days. Can the venom of an unrepentant Nazi still be potent?
