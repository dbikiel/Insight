In medieval France, the Devil intervenes when one of his two envoys, sent to seduce and deceive mortals, falls instead for a victim.
At the end of the 15th century, two minstrels, Gilles and Dominique, come from nowhere to the castle of Baron Hugues. Gilles charms Anne, Hughes' daughter, while Dominique charms both Hugues and Ann's fianc√©, Renaud. Gilles and Dominique are not really in love - they have been sent by the Devil to drive people to despair. But Ann is so pure that Gilles is caught to his own trap - How will they fight against the Devil?
