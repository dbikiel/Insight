A shy but smitten college boy pursues a NY go-go boy through the pretext of making a documentary film about him, with the guys knowing each other only as "Doc" and "Go."
College boy "Doc" is obsessed with a well-known NYC go-go dancer, nicknamed "Go." He befriends his hunky crush under the ruse of shooting a movie about what it's like to live in his skin. Camera in hand, he follows his subject across the city - into bars, onto rooftops, over dance floors and, ultimately, into his bedroom - but as they grow closer, flirtation blurs the line between subject and filmmaker until a steamy night together solidifies deeper feelings. Cory Kruekeberg's explicit directorial debut explores the thrill and danger of getting exactly what you wish for.
