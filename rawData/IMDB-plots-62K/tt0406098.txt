Three young adults in Most sort out feelings and responsibilities: Monika's boyfriend has left for the States, her mother wants her to join him there, and if the invitation does come, what should she do? Toník is a nice guy, his love for Moni is unrequited. He's trying to rebuild his family's crumbling house; a nearby factory has made an offer to buy the land. With Moni, he watches out for the two young sons of Dasha, their friend who's in a hopeless long-term affair with a married man: Dasha is at once unstable, unrealistic, neglectful of her boys, and cruel to those who help. For whom is this something like happiness?
In a industrial city in the Czech Republic, Monika 'Moni', Tonik and Dasha are old friends that live in a working class building. Moni's boyfriend Jirka has just emigrated to the United States of America expecting to have a better life and promises to bring Moni later. Her mother Jirina, who is a woman frustrated with her marriage with the unemployed Olda Soucek, presses Moni to move on together with Jirka, but her father would rather prefer his daughter to stay in their country. Tonik is a loser, but a good man, that has an unrequited love for Moni. His estranged father would like him to work in the local factory, but Tonik has chosen to move to the ruined house that belonged to his grandfather and the factory wants to buy where his aunt lives. Dasha is an unbalanced, neglectful and ungrateful single mother with two sons, Denis and Pat, and has an affair with the married Jára. When Dasha has a mental breakdown, she is interned in a psychiatric hospital and Moni decides to stay in the Czech Republic with the children, otherwise they will be sent to the orphanage. She moves to Tonik's house and together with his aunt, they work hard to restore the house. Out of the blue, Dasha returns to take her children.
