A struggling young couple stumbles upon a cache of dirty money after a shootout in their apartment building. With hopes of a better life they flee with the money -- provoking the fury of a corrupt DEA agent who will stop at nothing to get his money back, and arousing the suspicions of a detective who is determined to find out what's really going before its too late.
Money changes everything, at least that's what Duke and Amber would like to believe. Duke, a hapless Iraq War vet, stumbles onto a drug deal turned deadly and finds a duffel bag stuffed with dirty money. After stopping for a quickie wedding, Duke and Amber hit the road to start the life they've always dreamed about. The dream quickly turns into a nightmare when Pollen, a corrupt DEA agent, comes to reclaim what he believes is rightfully his. The chase begins with non-stop, hair-raising action as Duke and Amber are forced to outwit the increasingly crazed Pollen as they fight for their very lives.
