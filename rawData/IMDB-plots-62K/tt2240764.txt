Gay older Parisian takes home a drunken American found in the street. A romantic connection forms despite the younger man's secret - he's famous.
Frenchman Claude (Yann De Monterno) had a bad relationship in USA ages ago; that's why he came back to France. One early dawn as he is walking towards his home, he sees a drunken American lying on the pavement. Claude takes him to his home because there was no way to identify the Young American. When they have a chance to talk, the young American's name is Brad (Kevin Miranda). That chance meeting leads to their relationship but Brad seems an enigma, seeming aloof even to Claude's BFF Catherine (Florence D' Azemar). Things get worse on the day of Claude's birthday, when a group of friends surprise him at his home; one recognizes Brad. Will Claude and Brad have the chance for a long term relationship?
Elder Parisian Claude discovers a handsome but dead drunk young American in an alley and takes him home. The young man later introduces himself as Brad, and an easy, intimate relationship begins between the men. Despite their age difference, they seem quite content in each other's company - up until Claude's best friend, Catherine, hosts a surprise birthday party where Brad turns out not to be a mere nobody.
