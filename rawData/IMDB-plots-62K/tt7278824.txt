Romulus and Remus, two shepherds and loyal brothers, end up taking part to a journey that will lead one of them to be the founder of the greatest nation ever seen. However, the fate of the chosen one will pass from killing his own brother.
Romulus and Remus are 18-year-old shepherds brothers living in peace near the Tiber river. Convinced that he is bigger than gods' will, Remus believes that he is meant to become king of the city he will found together with his brother. But their tragic destiny is already written. This incredible journey will lead the two brothers to creating one of the greatest empires the world has ever seen.
When the river Tiber floods, twin brothers Romulus and Remus are swept away by the water along with their livestock. They miraculously escape death, but are despoiled of their goods, reduced to slavery and deported to the city of Alba. Here, they are forced to fight against each other. Romulus leads a revolt and escapes together with the rest of the prisoners. The difficulties that Romulus and his mates have to face to keep their enemies at bay are endless, but Romulus never desists from his intention to cross the Tiber river and lay the foundation of a new city. To bring the gods' protection unto him, he steals the sacred fire of Alba together with vestal virgin Satnei. This act unleashes not only Alba's wrath, but also convinces some of Romulus's men that his sacrilege will cause misfortune. After Romulus is wounded in a night assault, Remus has to take care of his brother. Eventually he becomes the leader of the rebel group. But just when Remus begins to think the gods are on his side, Satnei foretells a terrible prophecy: the future Empire will be named after the brother who kills the other one.
