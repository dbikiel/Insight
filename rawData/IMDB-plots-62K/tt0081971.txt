Ah Q is a poor man that looks trivial, lives in small town Wei Zhuang and works as a casual laborer. Though Q is such a man, he always feels good about himself. He often makes trouble, gets himself into it and then gets abused and beaten. But he can make himself satisfied with his "spiritual victory" thoughts at last. Q ultimately is not able to save his life from a tragic ending.
