In New York City, a young girl is caught in the middle of her parents' bitter custody battle.
WHAT MAISIE KNEW is a contemporary New York City re-visioning of the Henry James novel by the same name, written by Carroll Cartwright and Nancy Doyne. It revolves around unwitting 7-year-old Maisie, caught in the middle of a custody battle between her mother Suzanna, an aging rock star, and her father, Beale, a major art dealer. In a race to win the court's advantage, Beale marries Maisie's nanny Margo, prompting Suzanna in turn to marry friend and local bartender, Lincoln. Both forced into a battle neither wishes to be a part of, Margo and Lincoln come to empathize with Maisie's position and over time with one another's. Teased by the notion of making their own surrogate family, the trio must either submit to the will of Maisie's parents or eventually face their wrath.
Caught in the middle of a long and messy divorce, six-year-old New Yorker, Maisie, struggles hopelessly to understand the incomprehensible world of the adults. Undoubtedly, in this relentless tug-of-war between Susanna, her neglectful rock star mother, and Beale, her self-absorbed international art dealer father, Maisie is nothing but a poor and innocent pawn trapped in a tragic and utterly chaotic game of chess with inevitable casualties. Under those circumstances, the angry parents infused with bitterness and contempt for each other, see Maisie's custody as yet another challenge that would appease their selfish nature, nevertheless, does anyone really know that the true centre of the world is, above all, their precious daughter?
