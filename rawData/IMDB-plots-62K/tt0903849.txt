A documentary exploring the increasingly critical world we live in. After starring in a film that was critically bashed, Jamie Kennedy takes on hecklers and critics and ask some questions of people such as George Lucas, Bill Maher, Mike Ditka, Rob Zombie, Howie Mandel, and many more. This fast moving documentary pulls no punches as you see an uncensored look at just how nasty and mean the fight is between those in the spotlight and those in the dark.
2 good comedians tell their favorite stories about destroying hecklers. 10 mediocre comedians talk about how much it hurts their feelings when people don't like their jokes. The rest of the movie is Jaime Kennedy reenacting 'Jay &amp; Silent Bob Strike Back' by tracking down critics that don't like him and telling them he got a blowjob this one time (seriously, I wish I made that part up).
