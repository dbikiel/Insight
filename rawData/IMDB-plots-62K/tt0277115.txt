Luis Martinetti, a contortionist suspended from acrobatic flying rings, contorts himself for about thirty seconds. This is one of the first films made for Edison's kinetoscopes.
Vaudeville performer Luis Martinetti demonstrates his novelty acrobatic act. Performing on the flying rings, he puts his legs through the rings and then contorts himself so that his head is between his legs. He swivels around to take up several different positions, in each case twisting his body around as necessary.
