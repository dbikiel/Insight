When nuclear weapons are smuggled into America, F.B.I. Agent Shane Daughtry (David A.R White) is faced with an impossible task, find them before they are detonated. The clock is ticking and the only people who can help are a washed up arms dealer (Lee Majors), a converted Israeli Mossad Agent (Stacy Keach), and a by-the-book C.I.A. Deputy Director (Randy Travis).
