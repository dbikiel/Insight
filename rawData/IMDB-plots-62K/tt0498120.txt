In Paris, six people all look for love, despite typically having their romantic aspirations dashed at every turn.
Seven lonely lives in Paris: a middle-aged estate agent who thinks a colleague is sending messages in video tapes she loans him; his co-worker whose Bible is close at hand in times of stress; her late-night charge, who's an angry, nasty bedridden old man; his son, a patient bartender; the bartender's best patron, an ex-soldier who's lost his moorings while his fiancée looks for a large flat for them; and, the estate agent's much younger sister, who answers ads in the personal and waits in cafés with a red flower pinned on her jacket. Will any connect? Can open hearts trump fears?
In a snowing Paris, six lonely dwellers have their lives entwined while seeking for love: Nicole is looking for a three bedroom apartment to move with her fiancé Dan, who is unemployed and has drinking problem. Her middle-aged real estate agent Thierry lives with his younger sister Gaëlle that tells him that party with her girlfriends every night. However Gaëlle indeed spends her nights alone in cafeterias waiting for blind dates that never appear for the encounter. Thierry's colleague is the pious and repressed Charlotte that loans a videotape with a musical religious show to him. But in the end, Thierry sees her in an erotic dance and he believes she is sending a sign for to him. Charlotte is nursing during the nights the aggressive and nasty father of the bartender Lionel that attends Dan every night in his bar.
