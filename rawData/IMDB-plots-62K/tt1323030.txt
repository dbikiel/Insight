After failing to get the anchor woman position she was promised solely as wife (now ex) of a studio boss, Kelly Faraday needs to feel her own roots again. She returns home with daughter Kamilla, to equally stubborn (grand)ma Ruth Hanson. Ruth makes them commit to try keep the ranch in the family at a time of drought, when neighbors sell to a company that wants to build a casino. Kelly's ex Walt Mitchell, now Ruth's foreman, rekindles her love-life, while Kamilla gets on with local rancher Hank Bentley's son Chuck. Further a company's trade in illegal, possibly unsafe drugs is discovered.
