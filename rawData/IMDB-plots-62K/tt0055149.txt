A theatrical impresario tries to win a bet with a psychiatrist over the production of a perfect baby.
A failing theatrical producer takes a desperate wager of £5000 with a psychiatrist that a perfect baby can be produced via hypnotising the pregnant mother, but she must be perfect herself. He contrives such a subject with a (unpregnant) French model and a remote cottage, but soon his fiancée and her fiancé get the wrong idea.
