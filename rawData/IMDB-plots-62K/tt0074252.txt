Giacinto lives with his wife, their ten children and various other family members in a shack on the hills of Rome. Some time ago he has lost his left eye while at work, and got a consistent sum of money from the insurance company, which he keeps hidden from the rest of the family. His whole life is now based on defending the money he sees as his own, while the rest of the family concentrate on stealing it from him, but things turn very bad when he gets himself a mistress and decides that she will live with him, sharing the same bed as his wife... In a mix of hilarious scenes and realistic portraits of social degradation, we follow the adventures of this peculiar family in their struggle to survive every day life.
