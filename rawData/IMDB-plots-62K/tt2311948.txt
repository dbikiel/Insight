Seventeen-year-old Grantham struggles to find his way as a man when a spontaneous road trip thrusts him into the care of a feisty eighty-one-year-old African-American woman named Rose.
Seventeen-year-old Grantham has just entered juvenile detention. Tattooed and hiding behind a tough exterior, he instantly clashes with his fellow inmates. This brings him to the attention of Rose, an elderly volunteer who mentors some of the boys. Rose has a unique style that is tough, wise, and unpredictable. Sensing something special in him, she offers an outrageous proposal to Grantham. She wants him to accompany her on a journey, the purpose of which she won't reveal. She is able and willing to spring him if he agrees. At first he thinks she is crazy, but Rose is crazy like a fox. She sneaks him out under everyone's noses and off they go. This is a charming and unexpected twist on that pillar of American cinema: the road trip. These are two people meant to clash ferociously, as well as to change each other in ways they could never anticipate.
