Ever since her brother died, Lupe has lived an agoraphobic life at odds with her teenage son and her superstitious Mexican mother. It takes a drastic Day of the Dead ritual to wake her up and teach her the value of saying goodbye.
If you saw Lupe (35) in her bathrobe and slippers, stuck at home making pies, you would never imagine that back in the 80's she was a pop-rock star. She and her brother Diego made up the band Groenlandia, whose first album was a huge hit. But Lupe has turned her back on that distant past of touring and concerts. She lives wholly dependent on her mother Paquita (65) and has a teenage son, Pancho(14), who hates her. Her agoraphobia won't even let her leave the house to buy the ingredients she needs for cooking. Luckily her mother, Paquita, a superstitious Mexican woman with a heart of gold,is there to do the shopping, deal with her frequent crises and do what matters most: be a mother to Pancho. But Paquita is running out of time. She just found out that she's going to die and she has only one final goal: to prepare her family for life without her.
