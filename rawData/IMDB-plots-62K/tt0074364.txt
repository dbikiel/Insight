Poor Leonida (Gino Pagnani) serves in the house of Count Aristide, his rich uncle with the hope of getting the legacy. At last he dies in the arms of beautiful maid, Ornella (Paola Maiolini) during an escapade. Rumors reveal that Count on his deathbed decided to leave everything to Marco (Claudio Ercoli), his illegitimate son who grew up secretly in a boarding school. The whole family of Leonida in the meantime had already moved to the luxurious estate of the Count and they certainly do not want to miss out wealth, and therefore the company of the cleverer puts in place a plan to marry the hereditary Marco to Leonida's daughter, Nicoletta (Ziggy Zanger), the little cousin. Leonida's wife, Elvira (Ria De Simone), will also be the accomplice of the subtle plan in possibly lending her own cheekiness to the young Marco.
