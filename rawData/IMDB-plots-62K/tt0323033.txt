Amidst a sea of litigation, two New York City divorce lawyers find love.
This is the story of two New York divorce attorneys who are often competing against each other, but end up in a relationship nonetheless. When they get married, can they avoid the same issues at home that lead people to provide them business at work? One of the central cases in the story is the heavily-publicized divorce of a rock star from his wife...
In New York, the efficient, insecure and single divorce lawyer Audrey Woods faces the charming, unethical but also efficient divorce lawyer Daniel Rafferty in a litigation case. On the evening before the trial, they date and drink a lot, they have one night stand, and she loses her first case in court when Daniel uses information disclosed by Audrey in their meeting in the previous night. She becomes upset with him and their competition increases, until the rock star Thorne Jamison and his wife Serena hire Audrey and Daniel respectively in the millionaire divorce case. They have to go to Ireland, where they get married after a drinking night. When they wake up in the next morning, they have to face the new reality of husband and wife.
Two prominent divorce attorneys begin to see each other in court, and sparks start flying. Audrey (Julianne Moore) and Daniel (Pierce Brosnan) see the worst part of failed marriages, which is why they have remained single. In court, they love to fight each other, each wanting so badly to win that they play dirty. One night, they are not thinking and they get married. While they did not mean to get married, they must pretend to the public that it was not a mistake. To save their careers, they decide to stay at Audrey's house, where Audrey starts showing affection toward Daniel, who discovers some information about Audrey's client (Michael Sheen), which Daniel accidentally uses in court, and feeling betrayed, Audrey asks for a divorce.
