In this off-kilter comedy, a woman comes to terms with her husband's strange secret: a compulsive desire to cut off his arms.
ARMLESS tells the story of John, a man who suffers from Body Integrity Identity Disorder, a real-life psychological condition in which an individual paradoxically doesn't feel "whole" unless he loses one or more major limbs. When he leaves his wife and goes to find a doctor willing to amputate his arms, it triggers a twisted romp filled with mistaken identities, missed chances, and tragic consequences. ARMLESS utilizes the structure of a classic farce, combining it with a darkly philosophical tone. It also explores the ways in which a culture with so much wealth can come to fetishize suffering. But at its heart, ARMLESS is a fable about acceptance, a meditation on trust, love and marriage.
