The following synopsis were provided by la_bon_chat. His/her writings were even more attractive than the film itself and contained the spoilers. Saluted to la_bon_chat and enjoyed.
****************************************************************************************************************************Main female character is in love with main male character though he can't stand her (his sole reason for despising the always gorgeous Sienna Miller? She talks too much. Okaaayyy.) Boy marries girl that he hates. (Why? Because he's on parole and her uncle is a sherriff. Duh!)  Girl dies.  Girl awakes and continues to live though her body is now decaying. Cue the teenybopper pop-country soundtrack aannd...Boy is now in love with girl. Mmm-bop!  (Why? Because she's the walking dead now, duh! I'm always falling in love with zombies.)  Cops think boy killed girl.  The cliche must-have, a "wise, older character", Cowboy Bob, hides them amongst his 'My Little Ponies' and takes them to their honeymoon destination--Niagara Falls.  Along the way she continues to decay.  Terrible soundtrack continues to accompany rotting and travel. (Don't worry--the decay is gore-free. Think, cute rotting...no peeling flesh or maggots.)  They reach gigantic waterfall, she disappears, cops appear, Uncle/Sheriff character says best line in movie, "I'm a lawman. I'm not afraid to take the law into my own hands. The real law...The law of love." and gives boy a gun. Boy gets shot. Girl reappears, riding a blue horse. Seeing her alive, cops back off. Together boy and girl jump into the falls while riding said horse. Onlookers gasp.  Cheesy song about miracles and love plays.  Credits. (Poor horse.)***************************************************************************************************************************Here we go for the normal plot description:The plot followed the two characters who just married were going to Niagara Falls on their honeymoon. Silas Parker (Franco) was a thief who marries Camille Foster (Miller), his parole officer's niece, in hopes it would be his chance to escape to Canada. But Silas couldn't stand Camille and she was blind to how he really felt, believing that everything would be all right once they reached the falls. After their wedding Camille fretted about there was no rice thrown and how that was bad luck.On the way to Niagara Falls they crashed their honeymoon bike and Camille died in the accident. Thinking that he killed Camille, Silas ran away &amp; breaking into a nearby house to call the police but hanging up before he reported the accident. When he returned to the scene of the accident he found Camille up and washing in a nearby river. Over the course of the trip Silas realized that Camille really did die in the accident as she started to decay. While taking care of her, Silas showed a kinder side due to his guilt over having accidentally caused her death.Meanwhile the police believed that Silas actually killed his wife and began to hunt him down. The couple evaded capture several times and ended up traveling with an old rodeo cowboy (Carradine) with colored horses. One of the horses, Maggie, was old and should have died years ago but was still sticking around for some reason. As Camille got worse, she and Silas grew closer, eventually dancing and kissing in the rain. Silas said that while he never believed in anything, Camille believed in him when no one else ever had.They finally reached Niagara Falls and took the boat tour together. As Silas smiled down on Camille, happy to be with her, she told him that she's ready now. He turned to ask someone to take their picture but found her then vanished. He got off the boat and headed towards the Canadian border, but stopped and went back looking for Camille. He's then spotted by the police and chased to the edge of the Niagara Falls viewing point. He screamed out for Camille - not believing her to be truly dead and gone - and the police, thinking he's still evading arrest, shoot him. Camille suddenly appeared, riding toward him on Maggie, the horse. She asked why he didn't go on without her and he replied he couldn't without her. He mounted up behind her and said "I love you" for the first time. They two kissed and then turned toward the falls. Camille said "I had a great honeymoon" and Silas answers "Me too."Then Maggie galloped forward and jumped over the edge into the Niagara Falls with Camille and Silas on her back, all three disappeared into the mist. After they jumped, rice started to fall from the sky.(I must admitted that my eyes were filling with tear at the end of the film.)
