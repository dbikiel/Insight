A simpleton turns into a gangster after his younger brother is killed and sets out for revenge on the perpetrators who destroyed his life.
Kundan is a naive and simple-minded young man who comes to Bombay City from a small village in Uttar Pradesh, along with his younger brother, Krishna. Upon arrival in Bombay, he is assisted by a young lady named Pooja, who also helps Krishna to read and write. The community where they live is being terrorized by a gangster named David. When Pooja's lawyer father, Satyaprakash, attempts to take this matter to court, he is killed. Kundan avenges his death by severelly beating up David, and making a big name for himself. Soon he is respected by everyone around, and attains the position of a gangster with a good heart. Kundan marries Pooja, and few months later they are proud parents of a baby boy. It is then that Pooja questions this living, and wonders if she would like to have her son also grow up to be like his father. Her attempts to sway Kundan are in vain, for Kundan has gone too far deep in this game, and the only they can stay alive is by maintaining a status quo. But will this decision be acceptable to Pooja?
