Sveta is eager to escape from Norilsk. It's even more of a dream because Maxim is out there in the far-away southern town of Temryuk waiting for her (or so she thinks). Nadya is the essence of everything that Sveta hates about Norilsk. The situation becomes even worse as Sveta's friends shamelessly and perpetually use Nadya's sexual services. When the disgusting dispatcher and prostitute gets an opportunity to leave Norilsk, Sveta's hatred reaches its climax. 'She has stolen my dream!'
