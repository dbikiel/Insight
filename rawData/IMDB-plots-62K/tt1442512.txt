It's been 10 years since Mr. Park's gas station was attacked by the No Mark motorcycle gangs. To get his revenge, Park (Park Yeoung-gyoo) hires a quartet of dodgy boys: a lethal puncher (Ji Hyeon-woo); a footballer with a killer high kick (Jo Han-seon); a potbellied wrestler (Moon Won-joo); and a video game addict who mastered the art of bluffing (Jeong Jae-hoon-I). But these employees turn out to be more dangerous when they demand their overdue salaries.
