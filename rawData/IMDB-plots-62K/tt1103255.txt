An aspiring pimp struggles to make a mint after inheriting his late uncles escort service and discovering that competition on the streets is fierce.
3D (David Alan Grier), an old school pimp, runs a dating service in Washington, DC. When 3D passes away suddenly, he leaves the family business to his na√Øve nephew JoJo (Kevin Hart). In attempt to turn the dating service into a legitimate business, JoJo tries to apply the wealth of knowledge he acquired while getting his 2-year degree from UDC. Jojos crazy cousin Avery (Donnell Rawlings), his lead escorts Angela (Tasha Smith), Vanity (Leslie Jones) and self-proclaimed legal advisor Payton Profit (Chris Spencer) try to help JoJo save the business by coming up with a hair brained marketing campaign that lands them behind bars and shuts the business down. Hilarious antics ensue, as this group of misfits bands together to save the business and their dysfunctional family.
