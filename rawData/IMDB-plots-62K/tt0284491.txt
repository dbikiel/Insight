Two angels, one from the heaven and one from the hell, come to earth to save the soul of a boxer.
A boxer named Manny, battling a potentially life-threatening brain injury, finds his soul to be the object of a metaphysical fight. Two different supernatural agents are sent to win over his soul to their side: one is an angel from a curious version of Heaven, that looks just like a beatific Paris, and in it everyone speaks French; and the other agent is a waitress from Hell, sent to seduce him to spend his eternity in a red-tinted prison where everyone speaks English.
When the leaders of Heaven and Hell, Marina D'Angelo and Davenport respectively, decide to fight for the soul of the decadent boxer Manny, they send their best agents to Earth. The singer Lola Nevado from Heaven and the former gangster Carmen Ramos from Hell are assigned to get his soul, and they have a tough dispute to accomplish their mission.
