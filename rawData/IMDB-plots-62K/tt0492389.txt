In the Oregon wilderness, a real-estate developer's new housing subdivision faces a unique group of protestors: local woodland creatures who don't want their homes disturbed.
Hoping to make enough money through an overseas employer to live comfortably, Real Estate Developer Dan Sanders manages to convince his son, Tyler, and wife, Tammy, to re-locate in a remote corner of Oregon. Tyler does seem content after he meets with lovely Amber, but Tammy is concerned about her husband when he near-hysterically claims that local creatures, including beavers, ravens, bears, fox, etc. have joined forces to sabotage his project.
Dan Sanders is land developer whose boss treats him like dirt. He made Dan move his family to Oregon to oversee a project. His son resents him for making him move there. But when his son meets a girl named Amber, he sees a ray of sunshine but she doesn't approve of what his father is doing. When Dan does something to one of the forest animals, the animals led by a raccoon decide to get back at him. And when Dan tells everyone what's happening to him they don't believe him. But his son does some research and learns that this is not first time this has happened to someone who encroaches on their territory. But Dan decides to ignore it.
When Dan Sanders moves his family to the country, he's put in charge of developing a suburban neighborhood in a wooded area. Dan soon finds himself under pressure from his boss to push the project through while his wife and son pressure him to move back to Chicago. But Dan's situation soon gets worse when the local wildlife, led by a wily raccoon, stand their ground to protect their homes. It's not long before Dan finds himself in all out war with the animals.
