A modern Christian-themed retelling of the classic fairy tale 'Beauty and the Beast'.
Belle Watson agrees to work for reclusive millionaire, Eric Landry, to pay off a debt incurred by her father accidentally breaking a valuable vase. As Belle gets to know Eric, she sees a kinder side to him than just the rough and rude exterior as society knows him.
