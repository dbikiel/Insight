In the Iranian ghost-town Bad City, a place that reeks of death and loneliness, the townspeople are unaware they are being stalked by a lonesome vampire.
An Iranian Vampire Western, shot in black&amp;white and with a killer soundtrack... it's a love story about two tortured souls in a desolate Iranian Ghost-town called 'Bad City', where a lonely vampire is stalking the towns most depraved denizens.
The film opens with a scene of a vast wasteland, Bad City, populated with oil drilling machines and a palpable sense of being a quasi ghost town. Here, Arash a lonely teenager with a drug addicted father who consistently owes money to a dealer, tries his best to make a living working as a gardener for a rich family. Unknown to him, the city is inhabited by a lonely young vampire whose name we never learn. She acts as a sort of vigilante, choosing to feed from those who she considers "bad", killing them without mercy. When one night she runs into Arash, she will finally know the possibilities that love offers, and that even in Bad City, shines a small glimmer of hope.
In Bad City, Arash is a young man that lives with his father Hossein, who is drug addicted, and he brings a stray cat home. Arash has a car that he bought after working for many years. One day, the drug dealer Saeed, who is also a pimp, takes Arash's car to pay the debts of his father. Saeed abuses of the prostitute Atti and soon he meets a young lonesome woman and takes her home. However she is a vampire that attacks abusive men and homeless and she kills him. Meanwhile Arash steals a pair of earrings from his employee and goes to Saeed's house to get his car back, but he finds Saeed dead. He brings his car and a wallet with drugs and money with him and starts dealing drugs with the users. He goes to a party dressed of Dracula and two girls give drug to him. Arash wanders through the streets completely lost and he stumbles with the vampire that brings him home. The vampire meets Atti and then Arash schedules to meet her during the night in a sort of date and he gives the pair of earrings to her. In the morning, Hossein trashes the pictures of his wife and Arash gives money to his father and expels him from home. Hossein takes the cat and goes to Atti's house and abuses of her, forcing Atti to use drug. The vampire attacks Hossein and kills him. Soon Arash finds the body of his father dumped in a wasteland and he decides to go away from Bad City with the girl. When he meets her, he finds the stray cat at her home. What will Arash do?
What happeneds when you accidentally meet a good guy on his first night off his face - and you've been the girl protecting the women and children in a bad city from bad men - Well, you fall in love, or do you, or do you simply gain a new perspective? As a lonesome young female vampire who's had to get a bit creative with the locals from time to time. Do you let this get in your head? Shot in black and white with slow direction and fantastic lighting this modern vampire love story gives a slightly different interpretation on the popular teenage vampire genre. Pay attention to the small props the director pays to past Vampire and Dracula classics. One such moment will flash a smirk across the face of anyone who's ever watch Bram's Dracula. It's brilliant. If Fellini made a teen vampire love story, I'm certain it could look a little like this. Grab a fork and sit forward for a dark, but enchanting Iranian version, of a spaghetti western teen vampire flick. But bring your own cheese. It's meaty.
