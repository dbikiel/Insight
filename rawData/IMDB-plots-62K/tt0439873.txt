A Christian fable about the end of the world, atomic-style.
This extremely rare film is a Christian parable told with puppet animation. It scope is broad: from the creation of the world to the birth of Christ to the atomic destruction of the earth. Extremely preachy, heavy-handed, and basically totally unlike ant other film in Tashlin's body of work (though it has some small connections to his Say One for Me).
