Walt Sherill is a mild-mannered space engineer who is a victim of a vicious "for kicks" assault by a teen-age gang. Increasingly obsessed by his desire for revenge, Sherill embarks on a manhunt of his own, and hampers the efforts of Detective Sergeant Pete Koleski, consequently causing some avoidable deaths.
