A group of escaped convicts take over a suburban home to evade the ongoing police manhunt, making the lives of the family living there a nightmare. The longer the men stay there, the more the tensions build and the more likely it becomes a tragedy will occur. Based on a real-life hostage-taking.
I saw this picture in 1955, and was impressed with Cassavetes' acting ability. i was riveted to my seat, wondering what the outcome would be, who would be the first to die, etc. I remember a scene in the desert north of Los Angeles, where the escapees were driving a Lincoln (?) automobile on a dirt road, bouncing all over the place. This was two years before I bought my first (of, currently, 7) Lincoln car; I was so impressed with the car in the film.
