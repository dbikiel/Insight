A graduate filmmaker chronicles a jam band's journey to a famous music festival.
Electric Apricot is a spoof of jam bands centered around the band, Electric Apricot, in the style of "This Is Spinal Tap". The members of the band go by the assumed names, Steve Hampton Trouzdale on bass and vocals, Steve "Gordo" Gordon on guitar and vocals, Herschal Tambor Brillstien on keyboards and vocals, and Lapland "Lapdog" Miclovik on drums and vocals.
In the Spring of 2005 a graduate filmmaker from UCLA set forth to make a documentary reflecting an element of contemporary music culture that had yet to be fully examined. The notion was to capture something raw and original. He searched for something unpretentious and genuine, yearning to make a film that would stand out from other music documentaries and potentially redefine the genre. Who he found was the band Electric Apricot, what he achieved is enlightenment. Unexpectedly while searching for enlightenment the duality of existence was unveiled.
