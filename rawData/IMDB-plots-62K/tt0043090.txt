A sharp-eyed woman spots a man with a gun on a train and her alert to the railroad police helps them in their search for a ruthless gang who have kidnapped a blind heiress.
Secretary Joyce Willecombe grows suspicious of two men boarding her train and is referred to 'Tough Willy' Calhoun, head of the Union Station police. The all-seeing, no-nonsense Calhoun is initially skeptical, but the men (who escape) prove to be involved in a kidnap case. Calhoun calls in equally tough police Inspector Donnelly, but the ruthless kidnapper's precision planning stays one jump ahead of them. Most of the action centers around bustling Union Station.
On a train to Union Station, Joyce Willecombe witnesses what she believes is suspicious activity by two men. Indeed, they have kidnapped Lorna Murchison, the blind daughter of Joyce's wealthy employer, and are holding Lorna ransom for $100,000. As the crooks use bustling and aways crowded Union Station as the drop-off point for the ransom, "tough" Lt. Bill Calhoun, Chief of Police at Union Station, leads the investigation along with equally pragmatic Inspector Donnelly of the city police. Joyce and Bill are two of only a few people who can identify the two men. The investigators use this limited knowledge to gather more evidence as to the crooks' hideout and hopefully a still living Lorna. Meanwhile, Joe Beacom, a penny-ante ex-con and mastermind behind the kidnapping, won't let anything or anyone, including his accomplices, stop him from getting the prized $100,000.
Lt William Calhoun, head of the police squad at Union Station, finds himself trying to solve a kidnapping when the criminals decide to use the train station as the drop-off point for the money. The victim, Lorna Murchison, is blind and her wealthy father is prepared to pay any amount to get her back safe. Working with Inspector Donnelly, they track down the kidnapper but he manages to escape leading to a final showdown in the station.
