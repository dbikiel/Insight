About a young woman who is married to a devout Jew and the problems that trouble their marriage because of the woman wanting something more out of her life
Sonia is a member of a closed Hasidic community, who doesn't feel comfortable about religious rules and restrictions, and constantly breaks them, upsetting her relatives.
A young Hasidic Jewess, trained as a jeweler, is unhappily married to a very religious scholar. She has a mystical bent which is manifested by ongoing dialogue with her deceased younger brother and by encounters with a mysterious but wisdom-dispensing older woman. After her brother-in-law offers her a job as his jewelry buyer in his jewelry business, she embarks on an unfullfilling sexual relationship with him. She loves her new job and meets a talented Puerto Rican jewlery maker whom she encourages to continue his trade. Her jealous lover thinks she is having an affair with the jewelry maker and destroys her life. Abandoned by everyone, she finds a new life in the ashes and sets out to pursue her dreams.
