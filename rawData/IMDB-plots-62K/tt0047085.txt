An American businessman in Scotland is conned into shipping a valuable load of cargo to a Scottish island via a coal powered boat.
The skipper of a tatty coastal 'puffer' boat cons an American into letting "The Maggie" carry a cargo to a Scottish island. The American soon realises he's been conned but can he stop them?
Mactaggart is the rascally skipper of The Maggie, a flimsy, rusting cargo ship known as a "puffer," which hauls freight along the western Scottish coastline and its islands. Although The Maggie is owned by his sister, he just manages to eke out a meager living while staying one step ahead of his creditors on his beloved boat. When rich American Calvin Marshall wishes to transport material to his new house on one of the out-islands, Mactaggart manages to trick his agent into hiring The Maggie for 300 pounds, a sum that might be used for some much-needed repairs, for the job. When Marshall learns that his valuable cargo is at risk in a vessel that's less than seaworthy, he does all in his power to abort the charter and have his valuable cargo transferred to a more reliable vessel. What Marshall is not prepared for is the wily Mactaggart's sly delaying tactics and crafty machinations.
