On the 21st July 1969 Neil Armstrong became the first human being to set foot on another world. Learning to fly just as the super-sonic era dawned, and honing his piloting skills flying Navy combat missions over North Korea, Armstrong was a product of his time. With additional experience as an elite, rocket-powered, X-15 test pilot he had just the right skill set NASA was looking for in 1961, when they recruited their second group of astronauts to shoot for the Moon. Achieving the first Moon landing and taking that first step onto its surface just eight years later, not only transformed human history, but also it changed Armstrong's own life as well. Drawing on private family archives and told through a series of intimate interviews, this is the story of the real Neil Armstrong, by those who loved, lived and worked with 'the first man on the Moon'.
