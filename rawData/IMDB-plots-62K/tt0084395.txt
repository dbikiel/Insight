It's been 10 years since Lizzie Borden High School's class of '72 graduated, and the preppies, the hippies and the in-crowd has returned to reminisce over good times past. But classmate Walter Baylor has returned too with a vengeance.
Lizzie Borden High's class of 1972 are going through the motions at their tenth-year reunion, until deranged alum Walter Baylor, driven insane by a sadistic senior-year prank, escapes from the mental institution and crashes the party. When guests start getting killed, the other alumni, including snooty yacht salesman Bob Spinnaker, class tease Bunny Packard, and class zero Gary Nash, spring into action to uncover the culprit. Chuck Berry makes an on-stage appearance.
