Vaarala, a reserved romantic photographer, has an odd artistic vision of loneliness: he takes serial photos of an empty park bench in remote spaces of nature.
When he meets and falls in love with the spirited, unruly Ansa his bench is suddenly filled. But in order to be with her he has to not only overcome his own frailties but the impending danger of Ansas volatile ex-con ex, and then Ansa herself, a woman prone to impulsiveness and impetuousness. Someone ends up dead , and in the mess of difficult and fractured small-town relationships, reaching far beyond Vaarala and Ansa, its not surprising. Its madness and mayhem and beauty and bliss: This is life, and these are the things we do for love.
