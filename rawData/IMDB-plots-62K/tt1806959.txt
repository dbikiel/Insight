A soulful romantic comedy with a twist, this evocative tale revolves around three people who must come to terms with their interwoven past, and establish a healthy harmony in their relationships.
Madhan is deeply in love with actress Ambujakshi but he always suspects her, which eventually ends in quarrels. When Ambujakshi goes abroad (Paris) to enjoy her vacation, Madhan gets irritated and approaches private detective Mannar to spy on her. Mannar accepts the job on one condition: Madhan has to take care of the medical expenses of Rajan (Ramesh Arvind). Meanwhile, Deepa also goes to Paris with her children. And with that, the hilarious joy ride begins!
