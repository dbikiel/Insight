In the Biblical story from Genesis, God floods the world as Noah rescues his family and the animals in a gigantic ark.
The events from "Genesis" are reordered and compressed in this re-imagination of the biblical story. Sodom and Gomorrah face God's wrath, and only Noah and his friend Lot are chosen to escape from the sinful cities. The best of friends, Lot and Noah separate when God takes Lot's wife from him. When God expands his wrath to create the legendary flood, Noah alone is chosen to save his righteous family. Once aboard, the Earth becomes flooded, and Noah must lead his family to salvation and survival - even if it means facing his former friend Lot, now a leader of desperate...pirates.
