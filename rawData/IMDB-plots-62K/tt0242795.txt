Mathieu, 18, spends the summer at his mother's summer house, in Brittany. On the beach, he meets Cédric, a boy his age. A love-story begins between the two boys.
Eighteen-year-old Mathieu vacations at the beach with his family when he meets local teen Cédric. After an extremely erotic kiss, the boys begin a passionate romance, complete with skinny-dipping at night, nude dancing on the beach and intense lovemaking in the dunes; yet, as Mathieu grapples with his sexuality and copes with his sick mother, absent father and annoying kid sister, his bond with Cédric grows stronger until it bursts.
Presque Rien ('Come Undone') begins during one hot, French summer in a sleepy, picturesque town near the coast of Nantes and ends there eighteen months later. As Mathieu a quiet eighteen-year-old boy, spends yet another holiday with his depressed mother, nosy aunt and clingy sister, he meets a cocksure young man, Cedric who catches his eye while selling candy at the local seaside amusement park. The beautiful, more experienced Cedric begins to pursue Mathieu, and they are soon meeting for clandestine, evening encounters in the dunes. The young men open up to their respective families about the nature of their involvement, and a fragile happiness sets in. The audience is allowed to steal very private glances at Mathieu's memories and snapshots of his life, including his loss of innocence. These moments let us experience what happens to Mathieu after he gives in to Cedric's pleas for a life together. He learns to live independently for the first time, far removed from the people whose love he's always taken for granted.
