Walking jawline Tony Stone (Robert Z'Dar), is a tough criminal with questionable recruitment criteria for his henchmen. After he and his goons pull off a heist at a surprisingly well-guarded ice cream truck depot, they're caught by Lt. Sunset (Jim Brown) and shipped off to the slammer. En route, Stone's brother-disguised as the most unconvincing woman ever-springs the gang and gets gut-shot for his efforts. In search of medical help, the bad guys invade the home of all-American bad ass John Morgan (Harold Diamond). Morgan plays along with the criminals to save his family, but an all-American bad ass can only take so much before deciding to kill.
