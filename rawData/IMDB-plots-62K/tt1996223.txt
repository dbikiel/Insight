The animated documentary feature-length Crulic The Path to Beyond tells the story of the life of Crulic, the 33 years old Romanian accused of having stolen a wallet from the important Polish Judge. Crulic is brought to the Krakow Detention Center Custody prison. He decided to start a hunger strike from the day he was arrested, asking for: a meeting with somebody from the Romanian Consulate, a change of the attorney. In exchange, the Consul writes an answer to Crulic, in which he advises him to put his trust in Polish justice. Crulic claimed he was in Italy at the day of the theft, and not only the bus ticket, but also the record containing the passengers names, confirms his innocence. His detention was lengthened by 3 months. Finally, the Court agreed to release the man so that he could be treated in a civilian hospital. He died after 16 hours. Press investigation started in both countries. The repercussions of the investigation have concluded with the resignation of the Minister of the Foreign Affairs, while in Poland, 3 doctors were officially accused of Crulic's death.
