Dr. Gillespie's cancer has gotten worse, and to force him to take a rest instead of pursuing a sulfa-drug/pneumonia study, Kildare refuses to assist Gillespie, and instead accepts a case of hysterical blindness. She's also the daughter of a millionaire who could help the hospital.
Dr. Leonard Gillespie is approached by the very rich man, Paul Messenger, who is worried about his daughter Nancy's mood swings. Dr. Kildare meets the girl, without her knowing that he is a doctor, to see what he can find out. Nancy suffers from severe headaches and occasional hysterical blindness. With Gillespie's guidance, Kildare realizes it's all in her mind. Gillespie meanwhile is clearly not well. He's working too hard and is getting too little sleep leading him to faint in his consulting room. Kildare's parents unexpectedly come to New York City, ostensibly for a visit, but the young doctor doesn't realize his father is ill and seeing a specialist.
