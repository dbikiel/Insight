Brazilian chef Isabella Oliveira moves to San Francisco when her husband, frustrated by her motion sickness, cheats on her.
Plagued by chronic motion sickness, Isabella--a sultry Brazilian belle, and a gifted chef--needs to be in control in every aspect of her life: in her car; in the kitchen; on the dance floor, and of course, during sex. Needless to say, this confusing situation drives Isabella's husband, Toninho, crazy--and after one infidelity too many--the feisty young woman decides to do what she knows best: take over the reins of her life, and move to San Francisco. There, a brilliant career as the presenter of her TV cooking show awaits Isabella--and for the first time in a long while--she feels loved. Will guilty Toninho realise what he's lost?
Isabella is a great cook, making her husband's restaurant in Bahia, Brazil, a success. To control her motion sickness, she must do the driving and be on top during sex, which drives her macho husband, Toninho, to infidelities. Heart-broken, she leaves for San Francisco, moving in with her childhood friend, Monica, a cross-dresser. To mend her heart, she makes an offering to Yemanja, the goddess of the sea. The goddess responds: Isabella no longer loves and the fish in Bahia no longer bite. Stricken, Toninho heads north to get her back; he finds her hosting a popular TV show, Passion Food, courted by its producer. Can he learn humility? Can she find happiness without him?
