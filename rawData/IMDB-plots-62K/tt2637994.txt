Anna lives with her dog Manu. She thinks they will live together forever. When he dies, she buries him in the garden of the family across the street. But unlike Manu, the happy, bustling family does not need her love and affection. September is that ambivalent mood, between endings and beginnings, a struggle to find meaning and happiness out of life's ordinariness.
