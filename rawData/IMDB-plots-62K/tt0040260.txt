Donald adopts a baby kangaroo. It's more than he bargained for.
For some reason, Donald adopts a baby. It turns out not to be a duck, but a kangaroo. Donald takes little Joey home and tries to make him take a bath, with the help of the friendly lady of the adoption bureau on the telephone telling him what to do. After the bath, Donald's baby is scared by the rug made of a bear.
Donald Duck successfully applied with an adoption agency, but instead of a duckling, his baby is- a kangaroo! Incessant checkup and instructions calls from a nagging female agency (social worker?) voice interlace the various scenes in which inexperienced 'daddy' Duck wrestles with a baby who is physically his superior, yet must be bathed etcetera...
Donald decides to take parental responsibility, and adopts a baby kangaroo named Joey.Donald takes him home, where the rambunctious little fellow is like a hyperactive spring, bouncing all over the place. Donald tries to unsuccessfully give him a bath, as well as dry him off.As Joey playfully bounces around the room, a bearskin rug on the floor terrifies him. Donald decides to play a little prank, and pretends to fight the bear. Deciding to go a step further, he pretends to be eaten by the bearkskin rug, and begins to move around inside it.This frightens Joey, who then decides to get at the bear for eating his Daddy. Joey ends up pummeling and beating at the bearskin until Donald emerges unscathed, at which point Joey happily hugs him, happy that Donald is alright.
