Rolf, a former mercenary who now makes a living as a helicopter pilot, is visited by some of his buddies from his mercenary days, who want him to help them in a drug-smuggling operation. Rolf refuses to get involved in the deal, which angers his former friends and they beat him severely. He later finds out that his girlfriend has been raped and murdered, and he sets out to find out if it was his former friends or the local police chief--who has been trying to get rid of Rolf in order to get the girl for himself--who is behind it all.
