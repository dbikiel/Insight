An awkward high school student strives to lose his virginity before his parents and their Satanic cult can sacrifice him to the devil.
High school student Neil (Jesse Carere) has vowed to remain celibate due to his religious beliefs, as his church wants him to be part of a religious ceremony that requires him to be a virgin. Neil is unaware that his church, which practices Satanism, is planning to sacrifice him to Satan in order to prevent 1000 years of peace on earth. Once Neil becomes aware of this plan, he and his best friend Matt (Daryl Sabara) make plans to find a woman to take Neil's virginity and thus save him from certain death.
