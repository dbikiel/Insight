An ex-Confederate officer and his young daughter, traveling West, rescue two women survivors of an Indian attack.
In 1865 in Nevada, former Confederate Captain Ben Lassiter and his daughter Abbey travel through Modoc territory on their way to Oregon. At Fenniman's Station they stop for a meal, a bath and supplies. Inside the way-station, a group of Union soldiers, led by Lieutenant Weeks, are enjoying a meal. The patrol escorts an Army payroll and two sisters to meet another patrol, led by Captain Howard Poole. One of the sisters, Beth Drury, is engaged to Poole. The other sister, Martha Drury, is bitter at having lost her fiance during the American Civil War. When Ben Lassiter and his daughter sit for a meal inside the way-station, Martha Drury reacts badly toward the former Confederate officer and asks the Union patrol to arrest Lassiter. However, the Union patrol commander explains the civil war is over, shrugs Martha's suggestion off and orders the patrol to move on. Unknown to them, the Modocs have already set up a nearby ambush while other Modocs have surrounded Captain Poole's troop, pinning them down. Ben Lassiter and his daughter Abbey are the last to leave Fenniman's Station. Resuming their journey, they travel all day and they set up a night camp just off the trail. During the night, Ben Lassiter scouts around and notices a group of drunken Modoc Indians carrying liquor jugs, similar to those sold at Fenniman's Station. Fearing that the Indians have attacked Fenniman's Station, Ben Lassiter decides to wait for the sunrise and warn Lieutenant Weeks' payroll escort of the danger. Ironically, a former Confederate officer is attempting to save Union soldiers' lives.
