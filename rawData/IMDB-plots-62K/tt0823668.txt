Internationally known director Carla Garapedian follows the rock band System of a Down as they tour Europe and the US pointing out the horrors of modern genocide that began in Armenia in 1915 up though Darfur today.
Genocide recognition fuels the passion of alternative metal band System of a Down both on stage and off. When not performing the cameras follow the band and their loyal fans to confront politicians from the House of Lords to the US Congress. The murder of featured publicist Hrant Dink just as the film is released in 2006 is a sober and chilling reminder of what is at stake. First person interviews, historic and current footage are stepping stones that move from Genocide to Holocaust to Darfur. Director Garapedian portrays artistically in film what the band expresses with music.
