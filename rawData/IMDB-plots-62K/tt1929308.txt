A naive young tourist's road trip across Chile with friends turns into a waking nightmare.
Alicia arrives in South America to vacation with her cousin, Sara. When Sarah is suddenly called away, Alicia is stuck on a remote island off Chile with three of Sara's friends, including Brink, an American exchange student with a sadistic streak. Bewildered, frightened, and unable to sleep, Alicia's reality becomes a nightmare from which there is no waking. Ancient indigenous rites, disturbing animal behavior, and captivating hypnotic trances come together in an intense exploration into the darkest corners . . . when the games go too far, reality unravels with astonishing and deadly consequences.
The American Alicia travels to Chile to meet her cousin Sara and they immediately travel to a remote island with Sara's boyfriend Agustin, his sister Barbara and their friend Brink. Out of the blue, Sara returns to the city and Alicia is left alone with the trio of Chileans that speak most of the time in Spanish. Soon the unstable Alicia is unable to sleep and becomes paranoid; she uses lots of pills and gets in a journey with no return.
