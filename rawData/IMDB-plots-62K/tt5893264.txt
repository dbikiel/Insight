A writer goes through a tough period after the release of her latest book, as she gets involved with an obsessive admirer.
Basking in the tremendous success of her debut autobiographical novel dedicated to her late mother, suddenly, the lonely Parisian author, Delphine Dayrieux, realises that there are cold and unrelenting haters among a sea of worshippers. On the other hand, though, there's Elle--the passionate admirer, and cryptic new friend--who takes Delphine by surprise, and just like that, worms her way into the unsuspecting writer's life. However, who is truly this elusive and alluringly enigmatic woman who is bent on helping Delphine break through a persistent writer's block? More and more, Elle becomes designingly indispensable. Can she jolt Delphine out of her torpor?
