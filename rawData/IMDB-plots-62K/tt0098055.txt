Because of an accident, Michele (a leader of P.C.I. and a water-polo player) loses his memory. During one water-polo match, strange guys torment him; they want him to remember his past. As the match is about to finish, he misses the penalty which would have let his team draw the match and keep the leadership.
Michele is the leader of the Italian communist party and a professional water polo player. On this day he's just lost his memory following a (very stupid) car accident. So he has to discover the intricacies of his life again, and he does so through the naive eyes of the anxious child he used to be - through an improvised psychoanalytic trip symbolized by the friendships and adversities of a water polo game.
