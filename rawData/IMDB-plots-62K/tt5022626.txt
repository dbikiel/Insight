An exploration of a new paradigm of health, science, and medicine, based on the interconnections between us and nature.
At a genetic level, humans are literally connected to the rest of the natural world through our DNA. But today's highly processed foods, pesticide based monoculture farming methods, increasing urbanization, obsession with technology and destruction of the natural environment distance us further and further from the world we coevolved with. We are out of balance with nature and the reductionist philosophy of modern western medicine, once immensely powerful, seems inadequate to answer today's challenges.
In Search of Balance explores a new paradigm of health, science and medicine that recognizes the importance of the interconnections between us, the food we consume, how we produce that food and the natural world at large, including the mysterious, invisible world of the human microbiome.
