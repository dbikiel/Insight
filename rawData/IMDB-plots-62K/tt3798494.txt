The film is a view from the inside on how it is to be in opposition in Russia of Putin. Attempts, mistakes, political tricks, seen through the eyes of the opposition leaders.
The main characters of this caustic report on Russia's chilling sociopolitical landscape are the representatives of the local opposition, for whom protesting against the Kremlin has become their raison d'Ãªtre. Their diverse lives form the foundation upon which grows a more general discourse on democracy, freedom, and the need of the masses to seek a charismatic leader.
This documentary project was conceived in may 2012, when Putin had settled into the Kremlin for his third term. The original experimental format of 'documentary bulletins', which were published daily online, allowed for wide-ranging content; the feature film focused solely on the members of various opposition groups. The work's neutral position remains and viewers have to interpret the objectively presented positions for themselves. The characteristics of this movie include close contacts with the protagonists and precise editing. It arches over the lives of people for whom protest became their raison d'etre and provides a chilling discourse on democratic rights and freedoms, the relationship of state power toward differently thinking groups and the tendency of the masses to seek out charismatic leaders.
