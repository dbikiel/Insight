In the tradition of classic horror movies, "Don't Look" is the story of five friends who leave NYC for a weekend they'll never forget.
Five friends from New York City embark on a rural getaway for a holiday vacation, but they soon find themselves being targeted by a local, murderous psycho, who may have connections to the group. A modern, female-directed twist on classic 1980s slasher films.
This movie is the opposite of the video game Until Dawn.
