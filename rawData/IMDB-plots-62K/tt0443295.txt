A widowed Coast Guard Admiral and a widow handbag designer fall in love and marry, much to the dismay of her 10 and his 8 children.
Admiral Frank Beardsley returns to New London to run the Coast Guard Academy, his last stop before a probable promotion to head the Guard. A widower with eight children, he runs a loving but tight ship, with charts and salutes. The kids long for a permanent home. Helen North is a free spirit, a designer whose ten children live in loving chaos, with occasional group hugs. Helen and Frank, high school sweethearts, reconnect at a reunion, and it's love at first re-sighting. They marry on the spot. Then the problems start as two sets of kids, the free spirits and the disciplined preppies, must live together. The warring factions agree to work together to end the marriage.
High school sweethearts Frank Beardsley and Helen North nee White are reunited when Frank and his family move back to his home town of New London. They are instantly attracted to each other and quickly decide to marry. They are quite cognizant of the fact that he already has eight children from his first marriage, and she has ten from her first marriage, hers a mixture of her biological offspring and a rainbow of adopted children. What may be more problematic is that he is an Admiral with the Coast Guard and as such has a very regimented view of how things should be done, whereas she is a free spirit - she is a designer by trade - with a more lackadaisical attitude. Their respective children, who are a product of their parents' views, hate each other. They however feel that they can better rid themselves of their new situation by joining forces to show their parents their respective philosophical differences about life. Regardless of if they achieve their goal, the kids' plan may also have some unexpected consequences.
