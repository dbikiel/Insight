A worker in a factory learns a lesson about life. When is enough?
A factory worker in a dark, gray world assembles devices that promise happiness. In his spare time he tinkers to create something better, and finally succeeds in perfecting his invention, which allows people to see life through rose-colored glasses. But he has to pay a price for his success.
Lost in a meaningless and dreary life, trapped without hope in a sad world devoid of colour, an idealist inventor struggles for a way out. Under those circumstances, his only shelters are his vivid childhood memories and an innovative contraption that helps to emulate a better world filled with blissful ignorance, however, will this Earth ameliorate if we look the other way?
