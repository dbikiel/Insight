Siberia. Late autumn. In taiga, in the deserted village there lives an old man Ivan &amp; his seven-year-old grandson Leshia. A pack of feral dogs devours everything alive in the neighborhood. One of these dogs is Leshia's best friend. Sometimes their relative uncle Yuri brings food to them. Once on his way back from Ivan's village uncle Yuri is attacked by dogs &amp; perishes. Ivan &amp; Leshia stay without supply. Once Leshia witnesses Ivan shooting at 'his' dog &amp; runs away. The old Man finds him in a dry well, but he fails to get him out on his own. Ivan sets out through taiga in search of help. Now the dogs are hunting him... And the boy is waiting for his father...
