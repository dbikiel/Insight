Working as a pornstar while a student at USC, Annabel Chong becomes the hottest ticket in adult entertainment almost overnight when she (over a 10-hour period) has sex with 251 men.
During a ten-hour period in January, 1995, porn actress Annabel Chong (1972- ) had sex with 251 men in front of cameras. The resulting video sold more than 40,000 copies (she was never paid the agreed-upon $10,000). This documentary tells the story of that day and connects it to Chong's life as a student at USC and as the daughter of a middle-class Chinese couple in Singapore. Annabel talks to the camera about her decisions; the camera also follows her to an AIDS test after the world-record-setting sex fest and home to Singapore, where she visits her parents who do not know about her profession and friends and professors who do. Should she tell her mother?
