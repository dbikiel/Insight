An unbalanced but alluring former mental patient takes a porn star prisoner in the hopes of convincing her to marry him.
Ricky is released from a mental hospital, and knows exactly what he wants to do. He hunts down Marina, a porn film star he once had sex with, and tries to convince her to be his wife. She is a bit reluctant, so he ties her up. Will this approach endear him to her?
Just released from residential psychiatry, where he became an all-round handyman, gentle orphan Ricky pursues his sole pathological obsession. Penniless, hence without a chance to court her, he kidnaps porn actress Marina from the set of crippled director Maximo's last movie. At first she hates her abductor. Once she realizes he risks and bares everything for her, she gets feeling for him to. But won't she still escape and return to her family and career?
