Allied agents attempt to infiltrate the Nazis' rocket research site.
This is the story of the methods used to defeat Hitler's V1 (doodlebug) and V2 (rocket) "revenge weapons" towards the end of World War II. Even though the Nazis were in retreat, these weapons could have turned their defeat into victory. This movie includes references to Hannah Reich, who was a German test pilot in real-life.
In an effort to learn more about German rocketry, the Allies infiltrate the Nazi missile works at Peenemunde. The Agents they have selected are all engineers and they assume the identities of real-life individuals who are either dead or otherwise indisposed. What they don't realize is that the mission has been compromised from the beginning by the fact that one of them men is wanted for murder and that one of the applicants for the mission is actually a Nazi Agent. In the end, the two remaining Agents assist the Royal Air Force in identifying the worksite during a massive bombing campaign.
