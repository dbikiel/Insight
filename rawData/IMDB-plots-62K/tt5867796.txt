Diane agreed, without hesitation to bear the child of a gay couple, Thomas and Jacques, her close friends. During her pregnancy, she moved to the old house of her grandparents in the countryside to do some work before selling it, and she met Fabrizio, an electrician. It is in this context, and over the months of Diane's pregnancy, they fall in love.
