A coming-of-age story of a teenage girl from a liberal upbringing who moves to a conservative baptist community in rural 1950s America.
Artist Stuart Anderson keeps moving all over the States, to inspire his painting pallet, with his wife and offspring. In 1954, they arrive in a rural town, where the kids Robert, Megan and Tamara soon feel really at home, although the previous owners moved out after their academically gifted son died from leukemia. Tamara (15) tastes of Chrustian faith and love with neighbor farm-boy Rusty Murphy. Then their ma is institutionalized with advanced tuberculosis, so people are scared to visit the 'cursed' house.
After years of moving, 15-year-old Tamara is tired of starting over. When her unconventional family relocates to a conservative country town, she discovers new friends, new romance-and a chance at a normal life. But just as she begins to feel at home, her mother is hospitalized, forcing young Tamara to grow up quickly and find the strength to keep her family from falling apart. Set in rural 1950's America, this coming-of-age story tells a tale of courage, faith, and the power of forgiveness.
