A couple's wedding day turns horrific as some of the guests start showing signs of a strange illness.
The action now takes place miles away from the original location and partly in broad daylight, giving the film an entirely fresh yet disturbing new reality. The infection has left the building. In a clever twist that draws together the plots of the first two movies, this third part of the saga also works as a decoder to uncover information hidden in the first two films and leaves the door open for the final installment, the future '[REC] 4 Apocalypse.'
This movie is set in a timeframe prior to the other two 'REC' films. It involves a couple (Clara and Koldo) who are about to be married. All their friends and family are there at the church and some are filming the wedding. Everyone can see that the couple are so in love, so happy, yet so not ready for what is going to happen while at the reception. They notice the police arriving outside the reception hall, but they're not sure on why they are there. And as in the first two films, things turn nasty for all involved. Will the newly weds survive the night?
On the day of the wedding of Clara and Koldo, their uncle Pepe VÃ­ctor comes to the ceremony with a wounded hand that was bitten by a dog. Soon the infection turns him into a zombie and he attacks the other guests. Along the day and the night, Koldo and Clara seek out each other while they see their families turning into zombies.
In '[REC] 3: Genesis' the action now takes place miles away from the original location and partly in broad daylight, giving the film an entirely fresh yet disturbing new reality. The infection has left the building. In a clever twist that draws together the plots of the first two movies, this third part of the saga also works as a decoder to uncover information hidden in the first two films and leaves the door open for the final installment, the future '[REC] 4 Apocalypse.'
