An action film for the youth generation, set in a decaying future London. A gang set out on a chase to avenge the murder of one of their own.
Set in a dystopic future London in 2015, where society has fallen apart, gangs have taken over and the economy is in complete anarchy. The story follows Junior and his older brother, Rager, who are in charge of a local gang, "The Paper Chaserz". They try to stay out of trouble and refuse to kill as part of their 'moral code', which is especially enforced by the strong but defensive Rager. Rager leads his gang, "The Paper Chaserz" and they plan to steal goods out of a local van. The robbery is successful, but a rival gang called The Soldiers, who are notorious and bloodthirsty in trying to take-over all other postcodes in the London area, attempt a theft. The "Paper Chaserz" escape, except for Junior who is stranded and cornered by The Soldiers. Rager reappears and saves his brother by beating all the rival gang members, telling Junior to leave. As Junior flees, Rager is attacked by the crews leader Tugz, who stabs Rager in the back multiple times. Junior now teams up with the rest of his gang to get revenge on The Soldiers. The gang meets a trio of girls named Ree Ree, Tash, and Little Lexy, who agree to help them as they also have a reason to get revenge against Tugz.
