Over more than thirty years, a department of the Condesa in Mexico City, is the setting in which they are carried out ten stories, mixed, form one whose only constant is the rupture. The passage of time and the outside world only guess through the windows and objects that come with the characters. The set is a great solitude, possible in a city of the blind.
