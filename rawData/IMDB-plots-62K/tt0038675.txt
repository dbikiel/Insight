Ingeborg is a small-town piano teacher who raises her foster daughter, Nelly, into young adulthood.

This is devastating news for Ingeborg, who is ill and does not expect to live long. Ulf, the stolid 30ish man in love with Nelly, begs her to stay; but she is not in love with him, considering him much too old. Instead, she is attracted to Jack, a new arrival in town.
