This is a delightful, if peculiar, story of a day in the life of a small, Welsh fishing village called "Llareggub" (read it backwards). We meet a host of curious characters (and ghosts) through the "eyes" of blind Captain Tom Cat (Peter O'Toole). This is a true "classic" of modern British writing with a wonderful, mischievous use of language.
One night while the townsfolk wrestle with their dreams, seedy Captain Tom Cat (Peter O'Toole) and a stranger walk the streets. Captain Cat is a blind, retired sea Captain, recalling memories of drowned shipmates and Rosie Probert (Dame Elizabeth Taylor), a whore, and the one great love of his youth.
