A precarious loner sneaks into a blind woman's home and begins living there without her noticing. Meanwhile, the woman mourns her recently deceased father and struggles to remain connected to the world.
Story of a blind girl (Tanaka) who lives with her father near a train station. Early in the film, her father dies, leaving her to live alone. Soon after his funeral there is an accident at the train station - a local man fell into an oncoming train and was killed. Or was he pushed? The story then shifts to tell about a Half Chinese/Half Japanese young man who works with the man who died at the station. Did he push the man to his death? He was at the station that day and flees the scene of the crime and hides out in the blind girl's house - at first hiding from her and not speaking. The film goes on to talk about her need to reconnect with the outside world and his quest to prove his innocence.
