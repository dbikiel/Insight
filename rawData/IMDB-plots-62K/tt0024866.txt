A little girl falls asleep and dreams she is in Toyland, where she and a toy soldier contend with the Beast from "Beauty and the Beast."
A little girl has a late night snack and falls asleep. She finds herself in a land where toys and nursery rhymes have come to life. Three heralds sing a welcome song warning her of the beast. Six wooden soldiers march in formation; she kisses the leader, who blushes and falls for her. Speaking of falling, Humpty Dumpty laughs at this and falls off, revealing five wooden ducks who do a song-and-dance number, ending by crashing into some alphabet blocks and spelling out "nertz." The soldier leads the girl to a bookshelf, where they sing the title song (helped by some other books). The finish, turn the page, and the beast comes out of the page after her. A fight ensues, with the soldier sending a toy airplane after the beast (it shaves stripes in its fur), along with some less effective attacks. The attack wakes the little girl up, and she climbs into her bed.
A little girl has a late-night snack, consisting of bananas, grapes and a box of candy. No doubt her meal is what causes a vision of the Sandman to appear before her and send her into dreamland, where she is soon floating high in the sky. Her immunity to gravity lasts only seconds before she hurtles to the ground. She lands unhurt thanks to her pajamas, which act as a parachute. Soon she finds herself in front of a castle, which lowers its drawbridge for her, as heralds trumpet her arrival. Inside is Toyland, where she meets a host of animate toys and fairy-tale creatures. She soon befriends a toy soldier, who blushes brightly when she kisses him. He will do his best to come to her aid when the Beast from "Beauty and the Beast" emerges from his book to capture and terrorize her.
