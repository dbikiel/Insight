A young woman becomes the eighth wife of the wealthy Bluebeard, whose first seven wives have died under mysterious circumstances.
In his adaptation of the grisly French folk tale, the pioneer director, Georges Méliès, divides the story of Cendrillon (1899)'s writer, Charles Perrault, into ten scenes, placing it amid a plethora of intricate and sophisticated sets. Having been already seven times a widower, the infamous aristocrat, Bluebeard, prepares for the nuptial ceremony, after buying himself a hesitant wife despite his dark reputation. Following a sumptuous wedding banquet, the wealthy nobleman gives his young wife the castle's grand tour--she is welcome to have the run of the manor, apart from that very specific room which is off limits. But with the key to the forbidden door in her hands, the temptation is insufferable. What could possibly lie within?
Lord Bluebeard is looking for a woman to become his eighth wife, as his first seven wives have all passed away. Many noble families bring their daughters to meet him, but none of the young women want to marry him. Bluebeard's great wealth, however, persuades one father to give his daughter's hand to him. She reluctantly marries him, and after a lavish wedding feast she begins her new life in his castle. One day as Bluebeard is going away on a journey, he warns his wife never to go into a certain room. When her curiosity finally gets the best of her, she realizes that she has placed herself in great danger.
