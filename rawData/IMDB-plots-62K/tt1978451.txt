After committing a hit and run, a beautiful career woman attempts to clear her conscience by befriending her victim, a homeless but talented street musician.
While driving down a back alley in Vancouver, contract lawyer Stephanie, distracted by reading some case materials for an imminent meeting, runs over a young seeming vagrant. Seeing that he is alive and mobile and that there are no other witnesses, Stephanie drives off without making sure that he is not injured, but not before they lock eyes with each other. Stephanie later sees the man, he a busker in a small combo in the same neighborhood as her office building. Her initial thoughts in seeing him are to ensure that she assumes no liability for the accident in he suing her, and then to throw money at him in the form of gifts to ease her guilty feeling, those gifts as she can see that he is indeed homeless. She is surprised that the man, Mike, wants nothing from her and seems to harbor no ill will toward her. Mike's attitude and homeless situation is largely to exist on his own terms, and thus not be beholden to anyone, despite his homelessness leading to health problems. Living on the street also means playing music solely for his own pleasure and not as a paid job. What money he has is primarily through the busking and from dumpster diving for bottles and cans. Stephanie is not only surprised by Mike's attitude, but how much she actually does enjoy his music. As such, she continues her assistance for him, she wanting to play a part in him getting back on his feet, especially in helping him with his music in a business sense. Stephanie's actions do not sit well with those closest to her, namely her parents and her fianc√© Christopher, who believe she should not trust a homeless person. But a further issue is how much assistance Mike will accept from her, he who truly does have deep seated feeling about the woman who ran over him and who may be hiding the true reason for his homelessness.
