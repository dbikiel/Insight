An unlikely romance brews between a tough-acting thug with a tender heart, and a recently single, IT consultant neighbor, in this lighthearted and wacky twist of a romantic comedy.
Kathir (Vijay Sethupathi) is a wannabe rowdy, whose only aim is to run a bar on his own. He is just back from five years of prison life and it was for his area councilor, who promised him to provide a posh life. Then, we have Yazhini (Madonna Sebastian) who loses her IT job during recession and due to financial crisis, she stays in the small flat opposite Kathir. The rest of the film is all about how these two people with drastically different dreams gel with ease and develop a liking for each other.
