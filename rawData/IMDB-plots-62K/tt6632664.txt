It's the story of a teen and his struggles in the last year of high school.
When you're young, sometimes it feels like the whole world is against you. At least, that how sixteen-year-old Steeve Simard (Lévi Doré) feels. He has begun his last year of high school at suburban Gaston-Miron High. Sharp-witted and bookish, he has a hard time relating to his parents and to other students. He hides behind his books and music, keeping the world out, except for his one friend Virgile (Jonathan St-Armand). But an incident involving the Spartan's Linebacker, the biggest guy in school, will force him to take charge of his own destiny.
