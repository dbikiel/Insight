Alice lives in a beautiful villa. She has a husband who makes a lot of money, a nine-year-old son and three servants who happen to be immigrants. She is superficial, haughty and racist. But everything changes the day her husband gets killed in an accident: the young woman suddenly finds herself debt-ridden. Forced to leave their magnificent house, she goes to live in a small apartment in a working-class neighborhood. To repay her debts she also has to find work. When she gets to know Eva, a call girl who works in the West End of the town, she follows her example. In parallel, during her free time, Alice meets a certain number of good people in her new area. And she feels closer and closer to one of them called Giulio.
