Young man fights off attempts to marry him off to a series of available girls. Intersting glimpses of London in 1930.
Reggie, the impish Marquis of Buckminster, has many friends and is happy with his present bachelor lifestyle. But his grandmother demands that he now get married to one of a few suitable women that she names, and have some children. Two of the women are twin sisters who are friends of his from another aristocratic family, so he visits them, and learns that they already have fianc√©s but commoners, against their family's wishes. If he can help them to marry the men they want, it will also shorten the list of candidates and maybe help him remain single so Reggie does everything he can to help them.
A British nobleman discovers that unless he chooses a wife from a list of eligible women provided by a rich relative, he will be cut out of that relative's will. He schemes to marry off the women on the list to his friends, figuring that if they're all married the provision will become moot, but things don't quite turn out the way he planned.
