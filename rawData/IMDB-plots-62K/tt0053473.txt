A wealthy wine grower has trouble with his wife, his children, his best friend, and his mistress across the way, who is murdered.
Leda, the flirt of Monsieur Marcoux is murdered. His wife and the police think, that the murderer was the milk-man, the friend of the maid, but Marcoux' daughter's fiance Lazo, who is aware of the corrupt situation in that family doesn't agree with them.
In the countryside of France, the dysfunctional House of Marcoux is in crisis: the patriarch Henri Marcoux has a love affair with the gorgeous red-haired neighbor Léda, a lonely artist that has just arrived from Japan. However Henri does not want the divorce, since he is interested in the vineyard, the house and the income that belong to his wife Thérèse Marcoux and the children. Thérèse is a traditional bourgeoisie woman that is worried with the appearance of Léda and gossip about her family. Their son Richard is a weirdo that loves classical music and is attached to his mother. Their daughter Elisabeth is dating the reckless gold-digger Laszlo Kovacs, who has become a friend to Henri and does not respect Thérèse. Their maid Julie is an easy woman that has sex with the milkman Roger. When Léda is found dead in her house, the police inspector investigate the murder and Thérèse and Roger are suspects.
