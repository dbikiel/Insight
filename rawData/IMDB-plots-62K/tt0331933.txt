A Texas Ranger must protect a group of cheerleaders who have witnessed a murder.
When a key informant against a notorious crime boss is assassinated, the only witnesses to his murder are five lively cheerleaders from the University of Texas: Barb, Anne, Evie, Heather, and Teresa. With the girls' lives in danger until the authorities discover the killer, the hard-headed Texas Ranger, Roland Sharp, has to go undercover and move in with them at a secret safe house, as the mysterious murderer is still at large. However, to effectively protect the teenage quintet of eyewitnesses, Sharp must first lay down the ground rules for a harmonious, and above all, safe coexistence. Will the man of the house succeed in his mission?
Texas Ranger Roland Sharp is assigned to protect the only witnesses to the murder of a key figure in the prosecution of a drug kingpin -- a group of University of Texas cheerleaders. Sharp must now go undercover as an assistant cheerleading coach and move in with the young women.
