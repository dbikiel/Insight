In 1659, jeweler Gabriel Tavernier miscuts a diamond meant to surmount the coronation crown of Louis XIV. He's thrown into prison and his son, Jean, is sent to India, along with the Baron Paul de Cabannes, to procure a replacement diamond. In India, Jean and the Baron meet the beautiful Queen Maya and quickly become involved in intrigue, adventure, and romance.
