A documentary about one man's attempt to turn the food pyramid on its head. Donal O'Neill ditches wheat and sugar in a food plan consisting of 70% fat - under the guidance of legendary South African Sports Scientist Prof. Tim Noakes.
The film follows a lean, fit, seemingly healthy 41 year old man on a quest to hack his genes and drop dead healthy by avoiding the heart disease and diabetes that has afflicted his family. Kevin O'Neill, an Irish Gaelic football star from the 1960s, won the first of 2 All Ireland Championships with the Down Senior Football Team in 1960 before the biggest crowd (94,000) ever seen at an Irish sporting event. When Kevin suffered a heart attack later in life, family and friends were shocked. How does a lean, fit and seemingly healthy man - who has sailed through cardiac stress tests - suddenly fall victim to heart disease? Can a controversial diet consisting of 70% fat provide his son with the answers?
