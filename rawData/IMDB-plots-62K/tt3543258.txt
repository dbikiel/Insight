After a near-fatal accident, on a horse the experts thought was nothing special, a determined rider from the wrong side of the tracks defies all the odds to pursue her dreams of winning a national jumping championship.
A former junior horse jumper champion, works on a ranch mucking out stalls and other chores for a living. By chance she gets the opportunity to show her riding skills, which kick-starts her career again. Meanwhile Elysse Dumar (Cassi Thomson) ridicules her for even trying to compete, suggesting that she should stay mucking out stalls. Even Debi's father doesn't want her to jump horses. But Debi (Nikki Reed) doesn't give up, and is determined to prove everyone, who thinks otherwise, wrong. With the help from Jonathan (Ryan Merriman), Mr. Valentine (Ving Rhames) and a few others who believe in her, Debi starts winning races and all looks well for the future. But then she falls from her owners horse while demonstrating jumps, and falls in a coma for 10 days. With her left side being paralyzed and unable to walk her future seems bleak. Will she ever ride and compete again?
