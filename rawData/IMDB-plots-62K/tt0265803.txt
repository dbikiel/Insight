A corporate lawyer is caught in a love triangle with an ambitious cabaret singer.
Billie Golden (Isabel Rose) holds a major fascination for the glamorous days of the Audrey Hepburn and Rita Hayworth era. She imagines herself to be a contemporary star actress and dresses up in clothes similar to the ones of that time. But in reality Billie is just a twenty year old waitress living with her drunken widowed mother. The closest she gets to becoming like her idols is by performing in a show at a godforsaken airport terminal.
