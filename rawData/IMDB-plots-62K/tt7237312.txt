Jim Carrey was once the king of movie comedies, but he's been something of a recluse on the big screen over the last several years. His last string of starring roles came in 2013 and 2014 with the releases of "The Incredible Burt Wonderstone," "Kick-Ass 2," and "Dumb and Dumber To," all of which misfired with critics and struggled at the box office. Although he appeared in a supporting role in this year's "The Bad Batch," he was unrecognizable and rejected all press opportunities to support the film. The documentary finds Carrey hard at work in his art studio, and it features some truly jaw-dropping paintings made by the actor. Carrey picked up art six years ago as a way to "heal a broken heart," and it's produced some of his best work ever.
