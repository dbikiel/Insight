A drama centered on the romance between Ernest Hemingway and World War II correspondent Martha Gellhorn, Hemingway's inspiration for For Whom the Bell Tolls, and the only woman who ever asked for a divorce from the writer.
It was a romance born out of war...and later torn apart by it. This powerful drama recounts one of the great love stories of the 20th century: the relationship between literary giant Ernest Hemingway and trailblazing war correspondent Martha Gellhorn.
