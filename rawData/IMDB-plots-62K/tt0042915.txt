A saddle tramp unexpectedly becomes foster parent to four children for whom he provides by working on a ranch that's embroiled in a feud with another ranch and cattle rustlers.
Carefree Chuck Connor is on his way west and stops off to see an old friend and his four lads. When his host is killed in a riding accident Chuck realises he must take care of the family. They hit the road and he takes a job on a ranch, but he has to keep the children hidden as his boss hates kids. There's also tension with the neighbouring ranch, and when a girl on the run from her nasty uncle joins the family unannounced Chuck wonders what he has done to deserve all this.
Chuck Connor, a chuck-line-riding saddle tramp loves his life entailing no regular job or family ties and the freedom to move about as he pleases. He visits and old friend, a widower with four kids, and when the friend is killed Chuck takes over the responsibility for providing for his friend;s children. He gets a regular job, and runs across evidence of cattle rustling and tries to run it down. One night he comes 'home' and finds that Della, a pretty girl who has just run away from her abusive uncle, has also moved in. And then the rustlers also come by to put an end to his snooping around in their business.
