Tom's fraidy cat cousin comes for a visit and Jerry takes advantage of the cowardly feline.
Tom's cousin, George, comes to visit, even though he's terribly afraid of mice. When Jerry gets out of Tom's ineffective prison, he discovers this and takes full advantage of it though he's rather confused, since Tom and George look alike. When Tom and George find this out, it's their turn to have some fun.
