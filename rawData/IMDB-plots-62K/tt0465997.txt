In this midquel to The Fox and the Hound (1981), Copper the hound dog, here still just a pup, joins a canine music band, and spends less and less time with his best friend Tod the fox. Is their friendship in danger?
In this midquel of the original The Fox and the Hound (1981), Tod and Copper are drawn toward a local carnival. Among these attractions is a group of singing dogs, who hope to one day make it to the Grand Ole Opry. Along the way, Tod and Copper's friendship is tested as they spend so much time away from each other. Hopefully, they'll make amends before facing this challenge again in the original film.
