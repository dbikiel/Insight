A film featuring the veteran soul music artists and music of Stax Records.
Stax Records launched the careers of Otis Redding, Sam &amp; Dave, Carla &amp; Rufus Thomas, and Booker T. &amp; The MGs back in the 1960s and 70s. But then disco hit big and all but wiped soul music off the map. This documentary harkens back to the golden era of soul and catches up with the carriers of the Stax dynasty, including Wilson Pickett, Sam Moore, Mary Wilson, Isaac Hayes, and The Chi Lites.
