Best friends set out to be the first people to ski a dangerous Alaskan peak.
Two best friends: a mountain skier and a professional snowboarder, go to Alaska to conquer one of the wild unexplored peaks. They want to be the first to descend on this snow-covered slope. One dream for two, breathtaking landscapes, speed, adrenaline, snow and mountains.
Maverick downhill racer, Tyler Crowe, reunites with best friend and renegade snowboarder, Mark Rider. It doesn't take long for the old friends to take on a new mission. Together they head to Alaska, where led by a veteran guide, the two attempt the most daring descent on snow ever caught on film. But with glory comes risk. And this challenge is no exception.
