A film scrapbook, images, phrases from our past, hiding their meanings behind veils. Let's lift those veils, one by one, to find how images, at one time seeming innocent, have revealed, after decades, to have homosexual overtones.
Filmmaker Mark Rappaport cleans out the proverbial closet of Hollywood and film history and unearths a veritable treasure of homo-erotic and gay subliminal gems, including everything from comedies to westerns, film-noir to musicals, and everything in between. Host/narrator Dan Butler leads us through a fun, but extensively documented, exploration of gay film history, from subliminal subtext to clearly visible. Included are many film clips of classic films and golden age stars.
