Baby Blues is a vintage fashion blog about loneliness. It is about Natalia's baby-boy. His existence shows how easy it is to fulfill teenage needs today. Just like ordering something in a fast food. Like saying: something to love and fries to go. But most importantly it is a blog about egoism.
Natalia really wanted to have a baby. Now she has got one and this extrovert seventeen-year-old life has suddenly become one big struggle. Feeling rejected by her still youthful mother, she clings desperately to her child. Her carefree skateboarding friend Kuba tries his best to get used to the idea of being a father but winds up using her tiny apartment as a venue for parties with the rest of his pot-smoking crew. Unlike many films about teenage mothers, Baby Blues is anything but a piece of gloomy social realism. Instead, it is an exhilarating ride through a garishly coloured world of clothes, sex and drugs and a ribald look at Poland's fledgling capitalism.
