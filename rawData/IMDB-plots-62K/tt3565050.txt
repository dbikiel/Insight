The History of Eternity is a synesthetic essay about love, desires and dreams. The entire narrative takes place in the same village with approximately 40 inhabitants in a desert landscape, a geographical point in northeastern Brazil with specific references in relation to time and space. A secluded place where everything happens at a measured pace, inspiring extremely visceral moments within the cycle that repeats itself eternally on the stage of human tragedy.
