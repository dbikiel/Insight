Adèle Hugo's unrequited love for a lieutenant.
Halifax, 1863. A young woman, Miss Lewly, comes to Halifax to search for Lt Pinson, with whom she is madly in love. Actually, she is Adèle Hugo, the second daughter of the great French literary figure and statesman. The Lt Pinson does not answer to her love and makes her understand it is hopeless. But as her obsession grows she keeps chasing and harassing him. This film about passionate yet obsessive love and self-destruction is based upon the real diary of Adèle Hugo.
In 1863, a young Frenchwoman arrives alone in Halifax, Nova Scotia. She is referring to herself by different names depending upon to whom she is speaking, but primarily she is going by the name Adèle Lewly. She is looking for an Albert Pinson, a British lieutenant stationed there. Again, she tells different people different stories of her relationship to Pinson and why she is looking for him. In reality, she is Adèle Hugo, the only surviving daughter of famed French poet and political activist Victor Hugo. She is looking for Pinson, a former lover, with whom she is obsessed. The womanizing Pinson admits to once loving Adèle, but has now moved on to other conquests. His disreputable past, specifically a gambling problem which has resulted in debt, was the reason that M. Hugo would not consent to Adèle ever marrying Pinson. In Halifax, Adèle spends her time either stalking Pinson, dreaming of Pinson or writing in her journal about her feelings concerning her love for him. To others in Halifax, Adèle is a captivating woman, especially to Mr. Whistler, the book store owner who is attracted to her. But Pinson wants nothing to do with her, especially as she takes more and more extraordinary measures to get what she wants. Her obsession slowly descends into utter madness.
