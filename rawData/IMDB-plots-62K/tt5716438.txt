Two Finnish boys battle adolescence and family troubles. Meanwhile, their homes are being encroached upon by inevitable urban development.
The movie tells what happens when sexual revolution arrives into a conservative and religious small town in Northern Finland, as seen by the 13-year-old Star Boy singers who are forced to observe their parents' sexual liberation and its consequences at too close range. It's a powerful story of two families of architects being torn apart by crumbling of moral conceptions and the parents' endless need for love and freedom. After a fatal toga party, no one and nothing is the same, and the boys' confusion erupts violently - Even though Star Boys deals with heavy themes, it is ultimately a warm and positive survival story that portrays the persistence and capacity of children to get over even most difficult experiences in life.
Two families in a small Finnish town by the sea; Marja (Pihla Viitala) and Tapio (Antti Luusuaniemi) are a vulnerable and misleading couple. Tapio balances between his own desires and responsibilities. Marja, on the other hand, seeks to maintain an intact family and self-respect. Ullan (Malla Malmivaara) and Tapio's passionate relationship threaten their friendship and marriages. Ullan's husband, Antero (Tomi Enbuska), focuses on sculpture. What are the limits of love? Parents who have either omitted or abandoned sexual liberties confuse those who have fallen in disarray, either at home, at the beach cottages, or even on the saunas. The figure is the third generation, represented by Marja's parents Tyyne, (Eeva-Maija Haukinen) and Olavi (Risto Tuorila). They are being chased out of their wooden house, as a block of flats is built for the building, designed by architect Tapio.
