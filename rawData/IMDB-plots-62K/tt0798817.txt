A naive young man assumes a dead man's identity and finds himself embroiled in an underground world of power, violence, and chance where men gamble behind closed doors on the lives of other men.
In Talbot, Ohio, a father's need for surgeries puts the family in a financial bind. His son Vince, an electrician, overhears a man talking about making a fortune in just a day. When the man overdoses on drugs, Vince finds instructions and a cell phone that the man has received and substitutes himself: taking a train to New York and awaiting contact. He has no idea what it's about. He ends up at a remote house where wealthy men bet on who will survive a complicated game of Russian roulette: he's number 13. In flashbacks we meet other contestants, including a man whose brother takes him out of a mental institution in order to compete. Can Vince be the last one standing?
13 follows the story of a young, innocent construction worker who steals an envelope containing instructions for a mysterious job that promises to pay out a fortune. He soon finds himself in the middle of a deadly ring of clandestine gamblers placing bets on the outcome of a multi-player, high stakes tournament of Russian roulette. It is a story of luck, chance, the loss of innocence and the relationship between power and money.
