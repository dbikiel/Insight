Upon getting engaged, a woman finds out that she is already accidentally married to a stranger and goes about getting her marriage annulled.
Two strangers, Gab and Dos, got tangled in fate when they accidentally got married. How? Why? When? Where? And - what?. Will Dos heed Gab's request of agreeing to an annulment (as soon as possible, take note!)? Will the process be that easy or something will get in the way?
