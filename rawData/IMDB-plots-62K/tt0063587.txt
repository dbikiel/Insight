A gunman joins up with a gang of Confederate guerrillas to find a cache of missing Confederate gold.
It's 1867 Texas. The American Civil War has ended but a handful of Confederate commanders and their units refuse to accept defeat and surrender. One of these commanders is Colonel Thomas Blake. He and his men raid the farms, towns and settlements where Yankees live. Rumors abound about Colonel Blake having gone insane. Many claim that Blake robs and kills for his own pleasure and personal gain rather than in the name of Confederacy. The authorities post huge rewards for the capture or killing of Colonel Blake and his men. However, Blake is shrewd and hard to entrap. He too wants money. More specifically, Colonel Blake is after the 200 thousand dollars that vanished in the final days of the war from the Confederate coffers. The money was last seen in the strong box of Confederate General Beauregard. Blake sends a trusted aide, Chamaco Gonzales, to inquire among the Confederate veterans and disbanded soldiers about the whereabouts of General Beauregard's strong box. But Chamaco is captured by Union forces and condemned to death by firing squad. Providentially, a man called Stuart saves Chamaco from execution and asks to be taken to Colonel Blake. Stuart and Chamaco ride to Mexico, right across the Rio Grande, to Blake's secret camp. There, Stuart tells Blake that he's a former staff officer under General Beauregard and that he wants to help Blake retrieve the 200 thousand dollars for the Confederacy. Stuart claims to know where the strong box is buried. Blake decides to trust Stuart and to follow him back to the USA where the strong box lies buried in a Comanche cemetery.
