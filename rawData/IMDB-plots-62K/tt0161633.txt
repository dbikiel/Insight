A dwarf scientist has his dreams frustrated when his sister becomes seriously ill. Determined to find a way to preserve the essence of his sister after the death, the scientist begins to use humans as guinea pigs in a bizarre experiment.
Intent on finding a cure for his dear sister's terminal illness, the passionate and unorthodox geneticist, Karazawa, realises that he needs to push the boundaries of science and to experiment with human tissue. Now, the shady stranger, Kato, has an offer Karazawa can't refuse; however--after several desperate and gloriously unsuccessful attempts to reanimate the flesh--the blasphemous researcher of the beyond finds himself back to square one, in grave need of a more compatible "guinea pig". Nevertheless, has Karazawa the strength to carry on? Above all, will he ever unlock the unfathomable mystery of life?
