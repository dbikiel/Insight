The daily hard life of a kid working in a photo shop, and tries to get closer to the girl he like.
A fourteen-year-old boy is employed to do everything in a photographer's studio where he is allowed to sleep. He is in love at a distance with a girl living in a wealthy neighborhood. One morning, he comes to offer his services in the house of his parents. He is left with hope. In the evening, the answer will be negative and without appeal - Kind of double teenage boy Zang-e Tafrih, the young Mamad Tadjrebeh changes his mind fixed: it is not a question here of sticking to his ball, but in the face of a young girl, believed acquired for only one exchanged look. Without roots and without a house, Mamad is a body floating between the streams of the city, an unnamed anxiety and without object that appeases the moped of the big brother, riding on the time of a round of court or the barely stripped torso of a woman followed in the crowd - Boxes, doors and windows punctuate this film of absence - as well as images, these photographs that the young apprentice class and stamps, mirrors of an elsewhere, of another possible world.
