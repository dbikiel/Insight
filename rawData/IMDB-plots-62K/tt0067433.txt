A museum curator falls in love with a crazy parking attendant.
Minnie breaks up with her married boyfriend and becomes disillusioned. However, she begins to learn that there is hope for love and romance in a desperate world when she meets a crazy car-parker named Seymour.
Seymour Moskowitz is a New York parking lot attendant, whose overly gregarious nature, which is done in an effort for companionship, is off-putting to most people he encounters, except those whose companionship he may not want. Minnie Moore is a Los Angeles museum employee, who believes that movies in general lead to unattainable expectations of love and romance, which has resulted in her unfulfilled personal life. Her relationship insecurities are partly why she stays and has a hot and cold sexual relationship with a married man named Jim. After Seymour moves to Los Angeles, Minnie and Seymour meet by chance at the end of one of Minnie's blind dates gone wrong. Despite their own first encounter being less than pleasant and them not being an obvious match on the surface, the two begin to date, largely as Seymour seems to understand what she is feeling about relationships. All the while, she still questions what she's doing with him, he who is not her movie ideal.
