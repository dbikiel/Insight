Louis goes to South Africa where American tourists pay to hunt wild animals in privately owned reserves.
Louis visits several privately owned reserves in South Africa where American tourists pay to hunt wild animals. He talks to an American couple of which the husband considers the hunting trip a dream and to the owners of the reserves who explain Louis that some species would be already extinct if it wasn't for the game reserves. Louis also accompanies some hunters and considers trying to kill an animal himself. He also wonders if it's not a rather artificial hunt, considering the animals are in a, very large, cage and the holiday hunters are being driven to the place where the animals can be found.
