At the end of the Civil War, an embittered Southern belle joins forces with a Confederate guerrilla leader to raid Union towns.
The setting is the Civil War and its aftermath. Belle's family has lost their land to Yankees. She marries Confederate guerilla leader Sam Starr and they continue activities against exploiters until she is shot riding to alert Sam to a trap. Highly romanticized and little connection with history.
