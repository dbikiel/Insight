A trigger-happy outlaw goes on the run and a burned out, disillusioned cop gives chase. They end up head-to-head in a Los Angeles shoot out.
Headed towards Hollywood, Rex is the "fastest fun in the West" --before long, he has a trail of dead policemen in his wake. Meanwhile, hard-drinking cop John Shepard is suddenly in the news after killing one of L.A.'s most notorious drug dealers in a shoot out. Word reaches Rex, who vows to challenge Shepard once he hits Los Angeles. In a final showdown as tense as high noon battles, Shepard and Rex come face to face.
