Thanasis Vengos plays a poor young man that comes to Athens looking for a job. We watch as he tries many different jobs; druggist, photographer, even wrestling referee. The result is always hilarious and explosive!
With dreams of a better future, the kind-hearted but maladroit jack-of-all-trades, Thanasis Birbilis, arrives in bustling Athens to find a decent job. Desirous of succeeding in the big city, Thanasis will leave no stone unturned in his search for employment; however, without any special skills, he is bound to fail. As a result, no profession is safe from the overzealous bumbler's successive monumental fiascos; be it an enthusiastic waiter at a tavern; a shamelessly biased boxing referee; a sleepy but creative pharmacist's assistant; an aspiring photographer, and finally, a lily-livered officer of the law. Will Thanasis ever prosper in the thorny Athenian urban jungle?
