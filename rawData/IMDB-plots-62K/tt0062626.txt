The players in an ongoing poker game are being mysteriously killed off, one by one.
After a card shark is caught cheating, he is taken out and lynched by the drunkards he was playing against. Soon afterwards, the men who were in the lynch mob start being murdered, one after another; all by hanging, strangling, or smothering. Who will be killed next and who is responsible? Is it one of the original party seeking to cover their accursed deed, or perhaps the mysterious Rev. Jonathan Rudd, who has recently arrived in town?
1880. During a dangerous five-card stud poker game in the dusty town of Rincon, Colorado, an unwise gambler is caught stealing before the eyes of one of the players, Van Morgan. As a result, the short-tempered, and trigger-happy gambler, Nick Evers, leads an angry, five-men lynch mob to exact his own kind of justice, only to see one of his poker companions dead a few days later. As more men meet their death, Van Morgan realises that he may be next--while in the meantime--the cryptic and righteous preacher, Reverend Jonathan Rudd, arrives in town, as suspicion spreads like wildfire. Does he have something to do with the killings?
Gambler Van Morgan runs a little card game in town but one night things get out of hand. A stranger amateurishly tries to cheat and, though Morgan tries to stop it, his fellow players string him up. The gambler leaves town but returns when he hears that the other players are being killed off one by one. It could be that someone will soon be after him too.
