Two kittens go on a metaphysical journey on a magical railroad train.
On the night of a cat village's Festival of the Stars, a kitten and his friend go on an celestial journey on a magical space locomotive. On that trip, they have various stops where they meet strange sights, even more unusual fellow passengers and learn some lessons of life on their trip to the terminus of the Galactic Railroad.
Giovanni, a young village boy, is recently going through hard times: his father left on a hunting trip and has not yet returned, his mother has recently fallen ill, he must balance both school and a job at a printing press, and he is often picked on by his classmates; and he's too busy to spend time with his only friend Campanella. Exhausted from all his hardships, he decides to lie down and take a nap in the woods. And a train appears to him from out of the sky. Fascinated, he climbs aboard, and is delighted to see Campanella already inside. The train takes off, and the two friends start on a sojourn through the stars, encountering fabulous worlds filled with fantastic characters. But it's only a matter of time before Giovanni understands the true purpose of the train.
