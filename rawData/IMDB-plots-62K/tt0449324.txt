Features a painter in trouble with his landlord. Then, magical dancing safes appear and the painter selects a bag of gold from each, and plays with his money until a fairy appears and escorts him to a fairy land where fairies dance for his delight. Meanwhile the painters' model comes back to his studio, where the painter tries to hang himself, when the rope breaks, and upon which the model enters the studio to find the painter on the floor.
