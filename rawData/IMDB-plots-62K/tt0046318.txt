Mickey and Pluto's peaceful day of fishing is interrupted by a clam that gets lodged in Pluto's mouth and a hungry seagull that steals Mickey's bait.
Mickey and Pluto go fishing. Pluto has a run-in with a clam, who eventually lodges in Pluto's mouth; Mickey thinks the clam is Pluto's tongue and can't understand why Pluto keeps begging for more food. After they get rid of the clam, Mickey's attempts to use his minnows as bait are thwarted by a hungry seagull; he brings his friends, and they chase our heroes away.
