When a white man sets out to keep Indians drunk so they'll do what he wants them to, the US government sends Autry to fix things.
Cavalry scouts Gene Autry (Gene Autry) and Pat Buttram (Pat Buttram) are ordered by the President (of the whole U.S. of A.) to break up an Arizona frontier ring which uses Indian raids to cover up its bandit activities. Carolina Cotton (Carolina Cotton) works with Gene and Pat, seeking revenge against the gang's leader, Dave Kilgrain (Harry Lauter) , who murdered her father. Lots of talk and Indian tribal dancing and stuff before Carolina gets around to shooting Kilgrain and Gene and Pat round up the rest of the gang.
