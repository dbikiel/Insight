Embarrassed by his large nose, a romantic poet/soldier romances his cousin by proxy.
A dashing officer of the guard and romantic poet, Cyrano de Bergerac is in love with his cousin Roxane without her knowing. His one curse in his life, he feels, is his large nose and although it may have been a forming influence in his rapier-sharp wit, he believes that Roxane will reject him. He resorts to writing letters to her on behalf of one of his cadets, Christian, who is also in love with Roxane but just doesn't know how to tell her. She falls for the poetic charm of the letters but believes that they were written by Christian.
Soldier and poet Cyrano de Bergerac is in love with Roxane, but he's too ashamed to admit it because of his big nose. When a cadet, Christian, falls for Roxane, he asks for Cyrano's help in sharing his feelings. Cyrano writes love letters signed with Christian's name, and Roxane doesn't realize that it's Cyrano's words she falls for. She marries Christian, and Cyrano continues to keep the other man's secret, even after tragedy strikes.
The classic, tragic story brought to the screen once again. This French film tells the tale of the soulful poet/philosopher and expert duelist named Cyrano who loves the fair Roxanne, but is ashamed to woo her because of his huge nose. Instead he writes love letters for slow-witted, but handsome Christian in order to win her hand for him. She falls deeply in love with the author, but doesn't know they were written by Cyrano.
