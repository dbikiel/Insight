Stanley, Harry, Sheila and Beth, four students from the 'free sex' Harrad College, spend the summer together to meet their families.
Stanley, Harry, Sheila and Beth have just finished their first year at Harrad College and have a special bond together. Harrad College isn't an ordinary school. The school conducts an experiment where students from different sex are put together in one room. Sexual freedom is encouraged. Now the summer break has arrived, the four have decided to spend the holidays together. They will visit an old friend of Beth and after that spend two weeks at the families of Stanley, Harry and Sheila. They have to fight against bias however. Not everyone is fond of Harrad College and some see it as only an easy way for the students to fulfill their feelings of lust. Will the relationships and beliefs of the four students hold up under the constant pressure?
