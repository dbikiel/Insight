King Edvard and Queen Paige fly to fictional Sangyoon for the arranged wedding of Princess Myra, who loves instead an humble boy. Eddie and Paige help, but they encounter problems and a royal elephant; still, though, true love prevails.
Just after the first anniversary of King Edvard and Queen Paige, they fly to the fictional kingdom of Sangyoon, in Southeast Asia, for the wedding of Princess Myra, the daughter of King Saryu. Paige realizes that Myra feels displeased and unhappy with her arranged engagement (economically motivated) to Kah, an unkind, unethical, and vicious businessman; Paige learns that Myra is secretly in love instead with Alu, an humble stable boy. Eddie and Paige seek a way to help, and they soon find themselves in an international incident. A royal elephant, Kayla, disappears, so Eddie, Paige, Soren, and Rayen go after her, and, predictably, then encounter a series of problems; however, they get help, and they find Kayla and return her to King Saryu. True love prevails, and even Soren gets a girlfriend.
