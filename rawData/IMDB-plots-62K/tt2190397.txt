Nobody really respects Camel Najer, the young Bedouin who works as a security guard at the central bus station. Neither his family, nor his colleagues. When the Israeli government threatens to tear down his settlement, he decides to act. Camel comes up with the plan to stage a bomb attack, which he will then prevent from happening, making him the hero of the day, hopefully saving his settlement and earning him the respect he's so desperately yearning for.
