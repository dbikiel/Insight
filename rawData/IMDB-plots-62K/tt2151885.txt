An average boy who resents his mundane life is struck by lightning during a particularly violent thunderstorm. When he recovers from the ordeal, he discovers that he has telekinetic powers.
This is the story of Walter Spackman (Noah Reid), a young man who is struck by lightning. When he recovers he realizes he has acquired a telekinetic power that lets him move objects up to three inches (nearly eight centimeters). He will soon be recruited by Troy Hamilton (James Marsters) who runs a kind of superhero team, training their power and performing various missions.
