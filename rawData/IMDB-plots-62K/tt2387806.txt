Rather than let cancer run her life, a young woman starts wearing different wigs to express herself and live her life to the fullest.
At the age of 21, fun-loving student Sophie finds out that she has cancer. Instead of letting the disease rule her life, she decides to enjoy it the way she would without the disease - by going to parties, flirting and having sexual relations. During chemotherapy, she decides to shave her slowly shedding hair, and finds comfort in using nine wigs, each of which helps her live out nine different sides of herself. Together with her best friend Annabel, Sophie goes from club to club, falls in love with her long-time friend Rob and writes daily posts on her blog. In this way she tries to escape from the dreary and tedious hospital routine and find new courage in life.
