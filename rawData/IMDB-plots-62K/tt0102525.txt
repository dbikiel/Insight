The story of Mel Mermelstein, an American holocaust survivor who confronted a Holocaust denial organization's lies in court.
Mel Mermelstein is a Jewish survivor of the Nazi Holocaust who is angered and horrified at the gall of the Institute for Historical Review, an organization claiming the Holocaust never happened. Although itching to challenge them, he is initially dissuaded by the fact that the organization's standard tactic is to post a reward to anyone who can prove the Holocaust's occurrence, then ignore all petitioners and claim that no one has presented any proof, thus ensuring themselves publicity and credibility. However, a lawyer notes that this kind of lying represents a breach of contract, leaving the organization open to a lawsuit. Using this bold legal strategy, Mermelstein presents his proof, the IHR takes the bait and Mermelstein takes them to court. Now, Mermelstein must battle the neo-nazis not only in court, but outside as well as they try to intimidate him to drop a case that would lead to the Holocaust's occurrence being declared a legally incontestable fact.
Mel Mermelstein, a Holocaust survivor living in 1980s California, is challenged by a neo-Nazi group after giving several speeches on his life and death struggle in the World War II death camp of Auschwitz. The "Institute for Historical Review", as the neo-Nazi group is called, offers a fifty thousand dollar reward if Mermelstein can actually prove that his Holocaust tale is true. When the group does not live up to their end of the bargain, however, Mermelstein sues the I.H.R. and wins the first U.S. court decision stating that the occurrence of the Jewish Holocaust is an established fact of history.
