After an astronaut and test pilot is catastrophically mutilated in a test plane crash, he is rebuilt and equipped with nuclear powered bionic limbs and implants.
Colonel Steve Austin, astronaut and test pilot, is badly injured when he crashes while testing an experimental aircraft. A covert government agency (O.S.I.) is willing to pay for special prosthetics to replace the eye, arm, and both legs he lost in the crash. Highly advanced technology (bionics) built into them will make him faster, stronger, and better than normal. In return, they want him to become a covert Agent for the O.S.I. It will cost six million dollars to rebuild Colonel Steve Austin.
