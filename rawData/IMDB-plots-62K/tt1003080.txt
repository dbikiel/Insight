Two Russian prisoners are abused mentally and physically.
Two men (both probably being junior officers) are held in a penal military prison. The room which they share looks like a dark cellar with a dripping sewer pipe running through it. One of the prisoners seems to be delirious and never stops talking. In order to cheer up his inmate, he tells lewd stories of his past, does some push-ups, comes up with crazy ideas and even mimics a heron only to make his companion go absolutely mad at him. The clumsy talker receives a violent beating from the enraged prisoner.The angry officer is then taken from the cell by a guard to clean up a dirty toilet bowl with a fork. Some time later, after a sleep the insane officer defecates in the only plate both share for eating, smears feces over his belly and devours a large portion of it. After doing so he offers a plate with the fecal matter to the other man right after he wakes up and drives him mad again. The two main characters go through a series of humiliating acts conducted by a guard and a captain who seems to have a strong sadistic streak. One of the prisoners remains oblivious to the situation throughout the story while the other one is becoming more aggressive and less sane with every moment. The story resolves with an act of graphic violence, including rape, sodomy, disembowelment, committing suicide and dying of a blood loss.
