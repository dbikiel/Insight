Twin Peaks before Twin Peaks (1990) and at the same time not always and entirely in the same place as Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992). A feature film which presents deleted scenes from Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992) assembled together for the first time in an untold portion of the story's prequel.
Assembled from the deleted and extended scenes of Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, and showing the untold portion of the FBI's investigation into the murder of Teresa Banks, as well as expanding on the last seven days of Laura Palmer's life, Twin Peaks: The Missing Pieces becomes an integral part of the deeper mysteries surrounding the Twin Peaks series.
