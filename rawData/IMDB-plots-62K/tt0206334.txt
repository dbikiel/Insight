A ridiculed HK cop hires 3 cadets, directly (thrown) out of police academy, to go undercover and get the criminals, who stole explosives and killed his partner.
The "Generation X Cops" are four young officers of the Hong Kong Police, joined together to fight against organized crime using all possible means, even if this would lead them to break the law. Their first assignement: eliminate a gang of criminals who have stolen a shipload of explosives.
