A troubled woman living in an isolated community finds herself pulled between the control of her oppressive family and the allure of a secretive outsider suspected of a series of brutal murders.
In her tiny island community, twenty-something Moll "Jessie Buckley" quickly falls for charming newcomer Pascal "Johnny Flynn". When he is named the top suspect in several murders around town, she defends him to her family but becomes doubtful as she sees his true colors. Geraldine James, Trystan Gravelle, and Shannon Tarbet also star. Written and directed by Michael Pearce.
27-year-old Moll works as a tour guide while living with her wealthy parents to help care for her father with dementia. The community is on-edge following a string of unsolved rapes and murders of young women in the area. During Moll's birthday party, her sister hijacks the reception to announce that she is pregnant with twins. Irritated at being upstaged, Moll leaves the party and goes to a nightclub, where she dances with a young man she meets there. The man aggressively pursues her as they leave the club and forces himself upon her near the beach, but Moll is rescued by poacher Pascal, who fends off her pursuer with a hunting rifle. They strike up a romantic fling, much to her family's discomfort, due to his outsider status and suspicions surrounding the ongoing murder case. As their relationship blossoms, Moll reveals some of her troubled past to Pascal: as a teenager she stabbed one of her classmates, though she claims it was in self-defense..
