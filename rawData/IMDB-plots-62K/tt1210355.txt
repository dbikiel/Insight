A teenage girl is hiding a criminal inside her bedroom closet. At first they have an innocent relationship: trading stories, making up rules, and goofing around, but slowly the man becomes bored with her girly ways and begins to spy on her lonely mother. One day after a jealous fight with the girl the man leaves the closet and makes his way into the mother's life.
Willful and troubled teenager Charlotte, resentful over her parents' separation, hides a criminal named Reyer in her bedroom closet, practically under her embattled mother's nose. The fugitive amuses himself with the teen for a while, but when he grows bored with hiding out in Charlotte's room, he concocts a story and seduces her mother, Miriam. However, the immature girl's mixed feelings about this development lead her to bring her estranged and emotionally distant father into the situation, with unexpected results. While the dad seems to equivocate, Charlotte takes matters further by demanding Reyer's departure and threatening him with the police if he does not go. This action, along with Miriam's discovery of the truth about Reyer, rapidly pushes all concerned towards a dramatic and violent confrontation.
