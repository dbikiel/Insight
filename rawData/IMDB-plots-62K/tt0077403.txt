Ali and his father go from their poor neighborhood in the outskirts of the city to a hospital so that Ali's father can be treated for his sickness. However since they have no money, Ali starts to work for Dr. Sameri who deals in blood.
From legendary filmmaker Dariush Mehrjui comes 'The Cycle', a bold and powerful commentary on the illicit blood trade in modern Iran. An impoverished young man brings his gravely ill father to Tehran in the hope of securing him treatment. After being unsuccessful, they encounter a doctor who offers them a substantial sum of money if they will assist him in some unspecified work. Ali soon finds himself involved in black market trading and as he descends further into chaos and disrepute, he must choose which path to take.
