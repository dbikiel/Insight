Shackleton's Antarctic Adventure is a giant-screen film that tells the dramatic true story of explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton's now-legendary 1914-1916 British Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. A testament to heroism and human endurance, the 28-man crew survived nearly two years in the Antarctic when its ship, the Endurance, was trapped and then crushed by pack ice.
