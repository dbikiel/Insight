The story of Orisbela, a young and religious woman who comes from Portugal to Brazil to marry Francisco de Albuquerque, a rude sugar-cane plantation owner, in 1570.
In 1570, Oribela, a young orphan girl was given to a Brazilian settler by Portugal Queen. She is sent far away to become the wife of the sugar beet farmer Francisco de Albuquerque, who is much older than her. This was done to prevent the Portuguese from having sons with the indigenous peoples and black people in order to keep the Christian marriage and a "pure" heritage. Although Francisco loves her, he is an unkempt man who lives in a strange household with his mother and sister. She does everything to escape until she accepts the help of the slave trader Ximenes to sail back to Portugal.
