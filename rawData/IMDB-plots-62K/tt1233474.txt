June 1998: Shiki has had a near death experience. Awakening from a coma, she has lost something very important to her, leaving a great void in her soul. A void that some beings from the afterlife want to take advantage of at any cost. But in contrast, she has also received a new gift: she just needs someone to guide her with her new power. Can she get that help in time? Can she fill the void that overwhelms her?
