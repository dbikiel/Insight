Pan encounters a water nymph.
Out of a diffuse background, figures slowly extricate themselves, acquiring more definition. One is a beautiful nymph, one a satyr. The satyr approaches the nymph. Although he serenades her with his pipes, she disappears... Music for flute by Debussy.
Employing bold charcoal sketches on white paper and taking inspiration from the inexhaustible classical Greek mythology, Ryan Larkin's first film portrays the sad story of a lost love, accompanied by Claude Debussy's enchanting "Syrinx" for solo flute. Desirous of conquering the Arcadian Syrinx--the nubile but chaste wood-nymph and goddess Artemis' reverent follower--the lascivious goat-god, Pan, pursues the lovely maiden deep into the lush forests of Mount Lycaeum. Desperate to flee from his importunate demands, Syrinx seeks help from her sisters in the river, who transform her into a cluster of reeds. In the end, Pan can never have Syrinx; however, he will always remember her through the sweet music of his indispensable syrinx--the musical instrument named after her.
