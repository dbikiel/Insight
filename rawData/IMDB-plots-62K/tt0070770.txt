A psychiatrist tells stories of four special cases to a colleague.
In a late night meeting as his modern asylum, Dr. Tremayne (Donald Pleasence) receives visiting colleague Nicholas (Jack Hawkins) and recounts the histories of four unusual patients whose cases he has solved. In "Mr. Tiger", Paul (Russell Lewis), the sensitive young son of prosperous but constantly bickering parents, befriends an imaginary tiger. In "Penny Farthing", Timothy (Peter McEnery), an antique dealer, inherits a penny-farthing bicycle which seems to have time travel capabilities - as overseen by the apparently haunted portrait of Uncle Albert (Frank Forsyth). In "Mel", Brian (Michael Jayston) brings home an old dead tree and prominently displays it in his home as a work of art, angering his jealous wife Bella (Dame Joan Collins). In "Luau", flamboyant literary agent Auriol (Kim Novak) hosts new client Kimo (Michael Petrovitch). Despite Auriol's overtures, he seems more interested in Auriol's beautiful daughter Ginny (Mary Tamm). As Ginny leaves for a mysterious holiday, Kimo's assistant helps Auriol prepare an elaborate luau for Kimo.
