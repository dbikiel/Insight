Lieutenant Frank Drebin and his Police Squad! are put in charge of security when it's announced that Queen Elizabeth II will be visiting Los Angeles, California. Frank visits the event organizer, rich developer Vincent Ludwig, who is also reputed to be a criminal mastermind, who may also be responsible for putting one of Drebin's men, Nordberg, in the hospital. Stopping the plot to assassinate the Queen, solving the attack on Nordberg, and romancing Jane Spencer are all in a day's work for Drebin, along with several laughs along the way.

Already entangled in a difficult case of heroin smuggling and the brutal murder attempt of a fellow officer, Drebin will find himself under the spell of Jane Spencer--the sensuous assistant of the ultra-suave criminal mastermind, Vincent Ludwig. Someone has set his sights on assassinating the prestigious visitor in front of thousands of spectators during an important baseball game; however, not on Drebin's watch. Can Drebin and his naked gun save the day?

Simpson) was nearly murdered while investigating suspicious activities in a boat named "I Love You". Meanwhile, Frank returns to the USA and visits him.
