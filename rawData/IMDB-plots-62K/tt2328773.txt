Three women bound by the shared experience of having lost their mothers during adolescence yet whose paths never cross.
The Club tells the story of three women - a southern artist reinventing herself after her mother's sudden death; a young mother living in a new country, discovering her genetic fate and a high-school senior seeking independence- all of whom lost their mothers during adolescence. Their journeys reveal how coming of age without their mothers has and continues to play a role in their lives. Structured around a series of 'dialogues' that focus on various themes threading their stories together, these ruminations allow for heart-breaking and at times humorous insight into how ultimately one's past can dictate their future. From intricate relationships with adopted mother figures, the cyclical nature of grief to their own mortality, the women of The Club provoke thoughts surrounding the innate and complicated nature of the mother/daughter relationship, even in its absence...
Excellent docu on what it feels like to be a motherless daughter. This one focuses on the those girls/women that lost their mothers in earlier life. But being someone who lost my Mother when I was 14 yrs old, I found this incredibly poignant. Really beautiful and not at all watered down. Highly recommended.The range of different subjects in this documentary (Jane Fonda...all the way to everyday people from many backgrounds; situations) give it a richness that might have otherwise been absent in a film about such a difficult and heart-wrenching topic.This is not an easy situation to weather in life, and its a difficult subject to approach. Its also something that could've been easily made one dimensional: I.E. Just sad with no real meat to it.This is a full meal docu. Touches heart and mind and day to day realities equally.Well done on all counts.
