After getting dropped by her publisher, celebrated novelist Hannah Ryan uses the negative forces in her life to inspire the creation of a pulp crime serial that posts new chapters to subscriber's devices every week. The initial release is a modest success but the work becomes a massive hit after a real life murder takes place that bears a striking similarity to Hannah's story. Is it really just a coincidence or is it possible that a copycat serial killer is acting out the fictitious murders in real life? And is he going to strike again once Hannah releases her next chapter?
