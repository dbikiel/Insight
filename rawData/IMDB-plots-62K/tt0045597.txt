Donald and his nephews are visiting the carnival. After Donald makes a relatively high score on a weight testing machine, he is thought to be a veritable strong man and takes on an offer from a little boy to fight his uncle in a boxing match. Unfortunately for Donald, that "little boy" is actually a con man in cahoots with boxer Peewee Pete who is anything but what his name implies. His nephews notice and try to warn Donald but he finds himself in the ring with Pete anyway.
Donald is conned by carnival attractions into believing he's strong. Chauncey the dog (in disguise as a milquetoast schoolboy) says "my uncle can beat your uncle" and Donald agrees, before he sees that "Peewee Pete" (Pegleg Pete, but without the peg leg) is the bruiser in question, in a "stay in the ring 3 rounds and win $500" attraction.
