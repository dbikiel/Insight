Documentary about the pioneering 1970s Zephyr skating team.
Sub-titled "The Birth of Extreme", this documetary takes a look at the transformation of skateboarding from its former image as a land-bound pastime for surfers to its status today as an extreme and acrobatic sport in its own right. Starting from the California surf community of Dogtown, the film follows the evolution of modern skateboarding through it's 70's heyday, its decline during the 80's, and its eventual (and highly lucrative) return in the 90's.
In the mid-70s, surfers from Venice-Santa Monica who hung out at the Zephyr Surf Shop would skateboard when the surf was quiet. Over the course of a few heady years, riding on polyurethane wheels and copying the surfing moves of Larry Bertleman, the Z-Boys invent and polish their style on a hilly street near the shop, on the asphalt slopes ringing school playgrounds, and then in swimming pools empty during California's drought. The Z-Boys astound upright skateboarders at the 1975 championship in Del Mar. Within a year, the team splinters as some players join better financed pro teams. The film ends with profiles of the stars, Jay Adams, Stacy Peralta, and Tony Alva.
