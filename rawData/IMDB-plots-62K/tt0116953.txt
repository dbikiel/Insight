With his boss in the madhouse, a mobster is temporary boss of the criminal empire just as vicious rivals threaten the control of the empire.
Mob boss Vic returns to business from madhouse. Meanwhile his best and quickest assistant Mickey Holliday is having an affair with Vic's girl Grace Everly and, at the same time, with her sister Rita Everly. What will Vic do? Whom will he kill? Is he really insane and weak? Many other mobsters, including Jake Parker, WackyJacky Jackson and Ben London think he's not so powerful anymore and hope to take his place.
By appearing first in a bathrobe, Vick the gangster boss, is aping the headlines of that era. We were seeing a Mafia chieftain in New York City appearing for his court appearances in a bathrobe, trying to cop a plea by appearing insane.
Richard Dreyfuss and a herd of aging actors make this a fascinating study for what happens when actors go over the hill. The exception to the rule is Ellen Barkin, playing a sexy, really hot gangster's moll to Jeff Goldblum's professional hitman. With the name of Holliday, Jeff gives us a great clue to the action as murder draw-downs follow murder draw-downs. Definitely a quixotic movie with no moral, whatsoever but fun to see.
