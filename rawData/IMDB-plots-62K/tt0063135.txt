A string of robberies has occurred in Britain and it's up to Inspector Clouseau to catch the criminal.
Detective Inspector is borrowed from the Surete on special assignment for Scotland Yard in hopes that a fresh outlook will help the government recover the loot from the Great Train Robbery, which is being used to underwrite a new crime wave. What they don't count on, however, is having more than one Closeeau on the job.
