A documentary following film fans working to restore the set of the climatic graveyard scene from the iconic spaghetti western Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo (1966).
In 1966 the Spanish Army built a huge cemetery with 5000 graves in Burgos for the final sequence in the film "The Good the Bad and the Ugly". After the shooting, the whole place was left behind and for 49 years, nature covered every tomb. In October 2015 a group of film fans decided to start digging and under 3 inches of ground they found the original paved circle. For months, people from all around Europe traveled to Sad Hill to unearth and rebuild the place. Sad Hill Unearthed is the amazing story behind one of the most iconic locations in film history. It explores the dreams and motivations behind the fans but also the transformation of art, music and film in a substitute for religion.
