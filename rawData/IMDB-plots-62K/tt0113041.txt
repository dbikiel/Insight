George Banks must deal not only with the pregnancy of his daughter, but also with the unexpected pregnancy of his wife.
In this sequel to "Father of the Bride", George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter's ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. As the comfortable family unit starts to unravel in his mind, a rapid progression into mid-life crisis is in his future. His journey to regain his youth acts as a catalyst for a kind of "rebirth" of his attitude on life when he and his wife, Nina, find how their lives are about to change as well.
Family trouble continues to plague George Banks. Having survived his daughter's marriage in the first film, he must now deal with her pregnancy. To complicate matters, his wife Nina is pregnant as well!
