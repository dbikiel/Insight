In a Scandinavian insane asylum, murderer Salem sneaks-out at night to exact his revenge on those who he deems responsible for his predicament.
A man named Salem escapes from an insane asylum where he was confined for an axe-murder. Falsely convicted under a plea of "guilty due to insanity", he does not plan to let his sister and her husband forget that they were responsible for the murder of a farmhand and for his cruel imprisonment in the asylum.
In the middle of winter in a farming community, two young women in two separate incidents are murdered in their respective beds in the middle of the same night: Britt Torens and Emmie, who died by strangulation and blunt force trauma to the head respectively. In the latter case, Dr. Anton Jenks, Emmie's brother-in-law - he married to Emmie's sister, Ester, the three of them who live on the farm passed down to the sisters and their older brother Salem in three equal shares by their father - is certain he saw Salem in Emmie's room, which is impossible as Salem has been institutionalized for two years. Salem was charged with the murder of one of their farmhands, Salem's barrister, Mr. Clemens, who convinced him to work toward an insanity plea. As such, Salem has been housed in the local insane asylum since. With the police investigation, there is circumstantial evidence that Anton may have killed both women, with his rants about seeing Salem only making him sound crazy. Ester indeed does believe Anton killed at least Emmie due to events from their collective lives. In reality, Anton really did see Salem, who, against the odds, had engineered an elaborate escape and reentry path in and out of the fortress that is the asylum. Salem has also devised a revenge plot against those who he felt wronged him in the case of the farmhand's murder, that revenge primarily against the person he knows did commit it.
