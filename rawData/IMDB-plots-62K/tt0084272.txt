The twisted tale of Caleb, and his alter ego Lester. After being pushed around too far, Caleb transforms into Lester and returns to those who have wronged him.
A series of bizarre murders have completely baffled the police to a point where fear grips the entire neighbourhood. Kaleb, a crippled gardener with thick lensed glasses performs his daily routine chores for some of the local residents returning to his dingy, filthy hovel and greets his brother Les. But Les is not quite what he appears, and neither for that matter is Kaleb. What follows is a frenzy of shock after shock as a quiet neighbourhood is turned into a slaughterhouse. LOVE BUTCHER is a profoundly disturbing film depicting senseless and psychotic violence.
