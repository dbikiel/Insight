Politicians scheme to clone themselves, assuring immortal life.
A young man escapes from a government-run project called 'Clonus' only to find out that Jeff Knight (Peter Graves), a presidential candidate, is conspiring to keep Clonus a secret. Top government officials are aware of it and support the super-secret project, because they are cloning themselves to live longer and better lives at the expense of their slave-like clone counterparts. Ethical and moral values are explored as the escapee known as Richard (Tim Donnelly) returns to Clonus, only to find his girlfriend lobotomized for government security purposes.
