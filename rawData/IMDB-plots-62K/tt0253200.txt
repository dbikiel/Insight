A group of old friends reminisce about their lives over the years after the death of one of their crew.
Jack Dodd (Sir Michael Caine) was a London butcher who enjoyed a pint with his mates for over fifty years. When he died, he died as he lived, with a smile on his face watching a horse race on which he had bet, with borrowed money. But before he died, he had a final request, "Last Orders", that his ashes be scattered in the sea at Margate. This movie follows his mates, Ray (Bob Hoskins), Lenny (David Hemmings), and Vic (Sir Tom Courtenay), and his son Vince (Ray Winstone) as they journey to the sea with the ashes. Along the way, the threads of their lives, their loves and their disappointments are woven together in their memories of Jack and his wife Amy (Dame Helen Mirren).
1989, south London. Jack (Sir Michael Caine), an ebullient butcher, has died, and his last orders are to cast his ashes off the Margate Pier. His wife of fifty years, Amy (Dame Helen Mirren), stays home, with the excuse of a visit to their mentally-disabled daughter. Jack's three closest friends, Ray (Bob Hoskins), Vic (Sir Tom Courtenay), and Lenny (David Hemmings), along with Jack's son Vince (Ray Winstone), head for Margate. Each has memories of Jack and of friendships, family, and conflicts. It's Vince's relationship with his dad that's the most complex, and Ray's long friendship with Jack and Amy that holds things together. The last orders, to go to Margate and strew the ashes, become an invitation to recall what's done, what's left, and what's important.
