The bank has been robbed, the night watchman killed and the safe opened. The townspeople want John as he was the only one with the combination. Clint gets John out of town but before the mob turns ugly but the deputy is shot when he and Clint go to get John at the shack. Things look bad for John, but Clint does not believe that John did the robbery and he will look for the real crooks.
The bank vault is found robbed but not tampered with, the Watchman dead inside, and only Banker John Cameron knew the combination. Clint Bradford looks for the answer and finds it in two brothers who share a room over the bank. As part time surveyors they have a transit which when placed through a hole in the floor can read the numbers on the vault lock. But now Clint must find a way to prove it as Cameron's trial for the murder of the Watchman is underway.
