After David Sloan is murdered, it's up to kick-boxing champ Matt Reeves to avenge him.
Kickbox champion Matt Reeves witnesses the murder of his friend Johnny. When he investigates on the circumstances it appears that a Mr. Neegal in South Africa has founded a new kickbox association and does not leave international champions much of a chance. Johnny had to pay with his life when he did not want to join. Neegal seems to kill everybody who is in his way. Matt is on his own now, but suddenly finds an unexpected ally.
Negaal is a former kickboxer who has formed his own organization in hopes to unite the sport under his iron fist. When David Sloan refuses to join the organization, he sends his three henchmen Moon, Pinto, and Bull to kill the champion and they succeed. Enter Matt Reeves, a friend of David's who just saw his student and friend Johnny win the U.S. title. When Johnny is offered to join the organization, he refuses and meets the same fate. Matt decides to head to South Africa and find Negaal. However, he finds an unexpected ally in Paul Croft, an Afrikaner who once worked for Negaal and was sent to prison in L.A. After being paid and ultimately refusing to kill Matt, the duo now join forces in hopes to stop Negaal once and for all.
