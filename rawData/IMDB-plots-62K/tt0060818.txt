Comedy about a flighty, bored, kleptomaniac wife of a banker who robs her husband's bank of sixty thousand dollars.
When James met Penelope at a club, it took all of three weeks before they were married. But after the marriage, other women became attracted to James and he kept getting promoted, which took him away from Penelope. So Penelope puts on a disguise and robs her husband's bank. Her psychiatrist, Greg, believes that this condition is caused by James being over worked and under romantic with Penelope. She also tells Greg that she robs the business associates of James. But Greg is in love with Penelope - in fact everyone likes her. The problem is when she confesses to her crimes, no one believes her.
Donning a disguise, Penelope Elcott has just successfully robbed the bank where her husband James Elcott works as its president. This robbery follows a string of jewelry thefts she has committed on targeted victims. Penelope is trying to figure out why she is doing these things with the help of her long time and exasperated therapist, Dr. Gregory Mannix, who himself is in a mental quandary over his love for her and now what to do with this information of her crimes. Penelope is not remorseful, nor does she need or even use the money accrued from her crimes. She doesn't believe she's a kleptomaniac as her thefts are not a compulsion. And she even flaunts with the idea of others knowing that she committed these crimes, people such as Horatio Bixbee, the police lieutenant in charge of investigating the bank robbery, and even James himself. But when Penelope finally comes to the realization of why she is doing these things and what she should now do, the obvious may become too obvious. And James may come to his own realizations too late.
A neglected wife turns to bank robbery to get her husband's attention.
