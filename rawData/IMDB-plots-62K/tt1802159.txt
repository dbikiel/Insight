A pickpocket in a plaid suit is constantly on the run from the police. He doesn't have any trouble evading the cops, as his magic powers can get him out of the tightest situations. Using special effects, the pickpocket can jump into tight suitcases, unravel into a plaid rug, and disappear into thin air, among other things.
