A woman, after being left at the altar, has a brief liaison with a handsome stranger on a plane which ultimately puts her and everyone else on the flight in terrible danger.
Dr. Halperin's assistant, who helped write a book which may influence world peace while exposing a dark brotherhood's plot, was left at the altar and leaves on holiday, carrying the only manuscript. Aboard, she awakes to find it missing with her other luggage, the start of a sinister series of events. Several people aboard are either criminals or help fight them off, especially hunky gentleman flight attendant Ronnie. But things aren't what they seem, so the fiends are in for scary surprises too.
