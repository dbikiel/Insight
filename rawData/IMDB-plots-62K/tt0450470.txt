Pedro and Rui kiss after a first-anniversary dinner; Pedro drives home, dying en route in a crash. Another pair of lovers, Odete and Alberto, split over her desire to have a child. Pedro lived in Odete's building. She attends the wake, stealing a ring, a last gift from Rui, from Pedro's finger. She behaves hysterically at the graveside, and later, wearing Pedro's ring, she insists she's carrying Pedro's child. Rui grieves as well, drinking too much and seeing Pedro's apparition. Odete's obsession intrudes on Rui, whose grief makes him vulnerable to her hysteria. Can this end well?
