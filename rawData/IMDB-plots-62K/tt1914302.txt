Dane only has one chance to make a stellar first impression. Good thing there's a lie detector present at his job interview! *BEEP* He's screwed. And he's going to find out just how much the truth really hurts.
Finally, the big day of his job interview has arrived, and Dane, an unemployed man in his thirties, is anxious to make it happen. However, prior to joining the firm, it is a strict policy for all future employees to take a lie-detector test, and thankfully, the new and improved state-of-the-art "Lie Detector 3000" is here to make this an easy job. Poor Dane, thank God you don't have any skeletons hidden in your closet.
