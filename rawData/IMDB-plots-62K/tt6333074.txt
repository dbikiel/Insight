Khaled, Mahmoud and Subhi volunteer with the White Helmets trying to save lives of hundreds of victims in the besieged city of Aleppo during the Syrian Civil War.
After five years of war in Syria, Aleppo's remaining residents prepare themselves for a siege. Khalid, Subhi and Mahmoud, founding members of The White Helmets, have remained in the city to help their fellow citizens-and experience daily life, death, struggle and triumph in a city under fire.
Syrian filmmaker Feras Fayyad in collaboration with Aleppo Media Center filmed the Syrian war for two years, which led to this breathtaking work, an imperative piece of boots-on-the-ground reportage following the exploits of the White Helmets, a search and rescue organization who indefatigably struggle on amidst Aleppo's humanitarian catastrophe.
Winner of the Grand Jury Documentary prize at the Sundance Film Festival, Syrian filmmaker Feras Fayyad's breathtaking work - a searing example of boots-on-the-ground reportage - follows the efforts of the internationally recognized White Helmets, an organization comprised of ordinary citizens who are the first to rush towards military strikes and attacks in the hope of saving lives. Incorporating moments of both heart-pounding suspense and improbable beauty, the documentary draws us into the lives of three of its founders - Khaled, Subhi, and Mahmoud - as they grapple with the chaos around them and struggle with an ever-present dilemma: do they flee or stay and fight for their country.
