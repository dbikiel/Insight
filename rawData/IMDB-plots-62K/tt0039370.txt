After leaving her family's farm to study nursing in the city, a young woman finds herself on an unexpected path towards politics.
Swedish-American farmer's daughter Katrin 'Katie' Holstrom leaves the farm to study nursing in the big, wicked city. Thanks to a chiseling acquaintance, her tuition and expense money disappears the first day, and she's forced to get a job...as a domestic for congressman Glenn Morley. Impressed by her political awareness as well as her many charms and capabilities, Glenn is soon infatuated with Katie, and she with him, but their feelings remain unspoken...until Katie speaks up at a party rally and is abruptly thrust into politics herself.
A beautiful Swedish girl leaves her home in the country with the intent of going to nursing school. She doesn't make it far before she's bilked out of all her money. As she tries to amass the necessary funds, she takes a job as a servant in the home of a wealthy Senator and begins to have political aspirations of her own. Oh, yes. She falls in love on the way to Capitol Hill, too.
