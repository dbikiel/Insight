A bullfight contest between Droopy and The Wolf, staged in the Chili Bowl.
Droopy and the wolf compete in a bullfight; the winner can get anything they want from all of Mexico. Both are inspired by the photo of Lina Romay on the cover of a magazine. The bull at first finds Droopy laughable. Of course, the bullfight is anything but boring and traditional.
