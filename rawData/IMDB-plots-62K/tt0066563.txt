When an attorney meets the girl of his dreams, he fears that his batty mother will scare her off, so he schemes to eliminate the senile old woman.
When New York attorney Gordon Hocheiser meets Louise Callan, the girl of his dreams, he schemes to eliminate his aging, senile mother, even though he promised his late father that he'd always take care of her. He fears that his batty mom's eccentricities will shortly lead to Louise's departure.
Thirty-something lawyer Gordon Hocheiser lives with his slightly demented and eccentric widowed mother. Although the dutiful son, he, who promised his deceased father on his deathbed that he would always take care of her and never put her in a home, doesn't particularly like having to take care of her and deal with her eccentricities. He has hired a series of full time care givers for her, all who have quit because they could not deal with her. Having to take care of her on his own - although he does get support of an emotional kind from his married brother Sidney Hocheiser - affects his life in all aspects. On his latest attempt to hire a care giver, Gordon meets private nurse Louise Callan, an inexperienced woman in every respect of the word. It's love at first sight for both. Because of Louise, Gordon, who has had fantasies of his mother's early demise, contemplates killing his mother, or worse, putting her in a home.
