The story of an adult male who, after the successful removal of a benign tumor resting against his pituitary gland, experiences all the changes and effects of puberty over a three-week period.
Perfect gentleman and psychiatric therapist Peter Newmans is assumed gay by his doting patients, female neighbors and profiteering male playmates who envy his slick way with women. Then he's diagnosed with and operated for a rare, non-aggressive brain tumor, which suppressed his pituitary gland, the hormonal trigger of puberty. To the delight of his father, who always waited for normal 'teen rebellion' and knavish womanizing, Peter now rushes trough phases of 'growing up' sexually, with the benefits of adult body and income but without normal experience, confusing him, his crushes and his male friends.
