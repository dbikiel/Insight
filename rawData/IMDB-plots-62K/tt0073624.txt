Two young men in a fast car travel through Georgia in the summer of 1958 en route to enter the National Championship drag races in California. In Macon County they pick up a wild girl who brings trouble and attract the ire of a local cop.
Two small-town young men, drag racer Bo and mechanic Harley, embark on a road trip from Georgia to California with the intention of entering the Grand National Championship drag races in California. But it's not long before the innocent-minded friends realize this journey will bring them more than they bargained for. Trouble greets them in the form of a runaway waitress who insists on traveling with them, a group of high school boys who don't like losing a street race, and a police sergeant who is determined to throw them in jail.
In the summer of 1958, two teenagers take their pride and joy, a hopped-up '57 Chevy, and start a cross-country journey to enter it in the Grand National Championship drag races in California. Along the way they hook up with a pretty, but dingy, waitress who quits her job and hops in their car. She turns out to be more trouble than they thought. They drag-race a gang of town punks who lose to them, accuse them of cheating, and chase them. While fleeing, they come up against a local cop who is obsessed with putting these two "juvenile delinquents" in jail.
