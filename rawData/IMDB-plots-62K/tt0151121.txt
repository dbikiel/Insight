Vishu and Ramu are a pair of Indian twins living in America with their father, Rajamani. When Madhumita (Aishwarya Rai) and her brother come to America to get medical treatment for their ailing grandmother, Vishu and Ramu end up meeting them at the airport. Vishu falls in love with Madhumita, and the couple has everyone's blessing, except for Rajamani, who is estranged from his own twin brother. He only wants his sons to marry twin sisters, so Madhumita pretends to have a twin in order to please him. As Madhumita puts on a charade by creating Vaishnavi, all goes well, until Ramu falls in love with Vaishnavi. Now the truth must come out, before Madhumita has to marry both of Rajamani's twin sons.
Madhumita lives with her mom, dad, brother, and grandma in India. As her grandmother has not been keeping good health, they take her for a check-up, only to find out that she can only be treated overseas in America. So Madhumita, and her brother accompany their grandma there. Upon arrival in America they are met with twin brothers, Vishnunath and Ramnath. After a few misunderstandings and misadventures, Vishnunath falls in love with Madhumita, and Madhumita also starts to fall in love with him. The twins' father, who also had a twin brother, would like his sons to marry twin sisters. Since Madhumita does not have a twin, looks like Vishnunath and Madhumita may have to separate and find other marriage partners or then can alternatively find a girl who resembles Madhumita, and who is willing to marry Ramnath.
