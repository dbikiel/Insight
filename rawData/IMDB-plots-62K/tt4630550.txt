A female doctor gets obsessed with the case of a dead woman after learning that the woman had died shortly after having rung her door for help.
The efficient Dr. Jenny Davin works hard and has been chosen to replace Dr. Habran, who has just retired, at the Kennedy Hospital. One night, someone rings the bell of her office after-hours and Dr. Davin asks her trainee Julien to not open the door since does not to seem an emergency. On the next morning, Police Inspectors Ben Mahmoud and Bercaro require her surveillance tape since a teenager was found dead on the other side of the road and they are investigating what happened. Jenny feels guilty for not opening the door and becomes obsessed to find the teenager's identity. Her investigation affects her relationship with patients that might know something about the unknown girl.
After taking over Dr Habran's community practice in Li√®ge, his successor, the hard-working, idealistic and compassionate young physician Dr Jenny Davin, commits herself into working side by side with the intern Julien treating welfare patients. However, it would take an unexpected ring on her doorbell, by what seemed to be a young lady in distress, to change her world completely. Under the excuse that visiting hours were already overrun by an hour, the otherwise conscientious and flawless doctor lightly decides to ignore the buzzer, and the next day, the woman is found dead a few meters away from her door by the river bank. Could she have saved her? Distraught and guilt-ridden from the idea that if she had answered the door, the poor nameless girl might have been alive now, Dr Davin will embark on an almost obsessive, amateurish investigation all over town to give a name to a nameless grave. Insistently, Jenny won't give up her search easily, however, is there any hope?
