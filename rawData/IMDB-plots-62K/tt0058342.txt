In a totalitarian society where daydreaming is forbidden, an imaginative boy fantasies about catching a mermaid and playing with her.
What if fantasy was a hideous crime against the law, punishable by Kafkaesque interrogation, brutal aversion techniques, and imprisonment? Under the heavy thumb of an autocratic totalitarian regime, an affectionate young optimist makes his dream come true: to meet a real mermaid in the flesh and explore the unfathomable fascinations of the silent underwater realm. Suddenly, music descends from the skies, and an unforgettable--almost transcendental experience--begins. Could this encounter be true, or is this a delightful but hopeless reverie?
