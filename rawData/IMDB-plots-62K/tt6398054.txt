This intense documentary follows real cases of American girls enslaved in the child sex trade through ads in a newspaper's online classified section.
The epic battle that several American mothers are waging on behalf of their middle-school daughters, victims of sex trafficking on Backpage.com, the adult classifieds section that for years was part of the iconic Village Voice. Narrated by Academy Award-nominee Jessica Chastain and directed by award-winning filmmaker Mary Mazzio, the documentary follows the journey of these young girls and their mothers in real time as they run headlong into a collision course not only with Backpage but with judges, powerful corporations, special interest groups, and an outdated internet freedom law that has been interpreted by federal judges to protect websites from any responsibility for hosting ads which sell underage girls. I AM JANE DOE is a gut-wrenching human story and fresh look at a social and legal issue that affects every community in America.
About the courageous girls who brought the Jane Doe v. Backpage.com case to court. The film raises awareness about how young girls are trafficked in this country and the injustices for victims that exist in our justice and legislative systems. We celebrate the brave victims who came forward, as well as the advocates, child welfare experts, lawyers, and others who have come together to end this scourge once and for all! See the film! It opens in AMC theaters nationwide on February 10.
