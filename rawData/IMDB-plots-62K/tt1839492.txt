A novelist struggling with writer's block finds romance in a most unusual way: by creating a female character he thinks will love him, then willing her into existence.
Calvin is a genius novelist who begins to type a new novel on his manual typewriter about Ruby, his dream girl. He can't believe his eyes, because the next day, Ruby becomes a real person, and they begin to have a beautiful relationship together. If the relationship isn't perfect, all Calvin has to do is simply type the words on the page and Ruby's actions change to what he needs.
Calvin is a writer who once wrote a book, but has been unable to write another one. He goes to a therapist but it's not helping him to write. He is also reeling from a recent break up. He dreams of a girl who captures his attention. He writes about her and names her Ruby. One day Ruby comes to life and whenever he types about her it comes true.
