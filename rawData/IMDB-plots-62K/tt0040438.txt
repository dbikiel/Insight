William McClure is the villlage doctor in a remote Scottish glen. Tricked into buying Lassie, a collie afraid of water, he sets about teaching her to swim. At the same time he has the bigger problem that he is getting older and must ensure the glen will have a new local doctor ready.
The good natured Dr. William MacLure works hard treating and caring for the sick in his largely rural highland home. He's a bit taken aback however when Mr. Milton sells him a beautiful Collie dog only to find that it is afraid of water. Given the number of streams and rivers he must cross to get to his patients, he feels that he has not acquired the helper he was going to get. MacLure cleverly and patiently teaches the dog and when he has an accident, she overcomes her fears to save him.
