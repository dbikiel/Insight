William Shakespeare, without saying a word, gives a quick run through of all his plays in a very special audition.
Will, a poor player who bears an uncanny resemblance to Shakespeare, auditions on stage in front of Peter, a busy producer with his nose in the trade papers, hardly noticing Will's extraordinary performance. Will, using the prop of a life-sized doll and changing costumes with magical speed, acts out brief scenes at the heart of Romeo and Juliet, Richard III, As You Like It, Hamlet, Antony and Cleopatra, Othello, Titus Andronicus, Merry Wives, the Tempest, the Winter's Tale, and other of the Bard's plays. It's an infinite variety show, and finally Peter's attention is on Will. What will the producer say when Will finishes?
