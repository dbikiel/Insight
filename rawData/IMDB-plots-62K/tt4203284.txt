A group of friends go for vacations on New Year's Eve.
Six friends spend New Year's at a house by the river. The host, Nicolas brings his ex-girlfriend Pilar with whom he just had a one-night stand. But, he hits on every other girl including the brooding Cata and the voluptuous Bel√©n. When Nicolas unexpectedly falls into bed and then into love with the high-strung Manuela who also happens to be his best friend's girlfriend, the last laugh is on him.
