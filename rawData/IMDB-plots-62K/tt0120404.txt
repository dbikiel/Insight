Michael Firch is very skilled in computers and he goes to Paris to meet very important persons to discuss a contract. Michael was born on a special astral date. On arriving in Paris, he meets Morgane and her son. Morgane is a witch, she is beautiful, she is good and she needs Michael to save her son from evil powers. Molok is a sorcerer and he opposes Morgana's plan.
Morgan is a witch, but a good one, and she doesn't want her son Arthur to become a sorcerer of evil like her cousin Molock. That's why she plans to take his powers from him with a special ceremony. For that she needs the help of a 'godfather' : Mr Firth, who has the same birth date as the baby, and who is an inventor of genius. So she bewitches him and go with him to her grand-mother's, who explains her the godfather will become dumb after the ceremony. But Mr Firth truly loves her and she's reluctant to use him. They go to Venice, where she tells him she's a witch. Molock finds them and try to kill Mr Firth. To stop him, Morgan has to promise she'll give him an heir...
We are in the autumn of Witchcraft. There are only six Witches left on Earth. Five of them defend Good against one for Evil. The question facing them concerns their descendants. Molok, an Evil warlock, doesn't have an heir. Morgane, a Good witch, is the mother of an adorable 2 month old baby: Arthur. This June 14th at 6 in the morning, Arthur will be 1 year old. And, just like all witches, he needs a godfather. If a Good witch godfathers him, he will serve Good. If Molok is the godfather, he will serve Evil. In order to save her son, Morgane casts a spell on Michael Firth, whose only fault was to be born on June 14th at 6 AM. If Michael godfathers Arthur, the baby warlock will lose his powers and Molok will no longer be interested in him. But Morgane hadn't counted on falling in love with Michael...
