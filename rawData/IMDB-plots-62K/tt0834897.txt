In a place, where man and nature have co-existed for years. Man has finally overstepped his bounds and nature is fighting back.
Jack Sullivan has been discharged from the military after a lengthy court marshal for striking a superior officer. Along with his 9-year-old daughter Charlie, the two move back to Jack's childhood home of "Mentor Headlands", a small town located in Northeastern Ohio's marshlands. As familiar as the Headlands are to Jack, he is struck by all the new development and the loss of woods and marsh he used to play in as a child. Shortly after arriving to the house he inherited after his father passed away, Jack is reunited with his old friend Bob Perkins, who is now the Sheriff. Bob is in the midst of trying to figure out what has been killing and mutilating the local animal population. Several deer over the last week have turned up ripped to shreds and with the help of Park Ranger Sandy Parker; the two have concluded that a bear must have wandered into the area. This theory makes sense to Jack until he sees something standing in the fog - a Bigfoot. Naturally, everyone thinks Jack is out of his mind. But, when some of the local residents meet the same fate as the deer, suspicions start to arise. This is not a story about the cuddly, misunderstood giant living in the Pacific Northwest. It's the story of a clever, murderous monster living in the marshes and woods of Northeastern Ohio. This Bigfoot is a victim of deforestation and urban sprawl and he is fighting back.
