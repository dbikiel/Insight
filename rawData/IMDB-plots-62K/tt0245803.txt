For 60 years a mysterious monk with no name has zigzagged the globe to protect an ancient scroll - a scroll that holds the key to unlimited power. Now the Monk must look for a new scrollkeeper. Kar is an unlikely candidate, a streetwise young man whose only interest is himself. But when he inadvertently saves the Bulletproof Monk from capture, the two become partners in a scheme to save the world from the scroll's most avid pursuer. Packed with spectacular special effects and martial arts action, the Monk, Kar, and a sexy Russian mob princess called Bad Girl must struggle to find, face, and fight the ultimate enemy.
Based on the very underground comic book, an immortal Tibetan monk mentors a young street kid whom he can teach to protect the ancient scroll he's been guarding for the last sixty years. With the help of a sexy and elusive young woman named Bad Girl, they come together to do battle with the kung fu master who'll stop at nothing to get the scroll.
An ancient scroll that, when recited out loud, grants whoever reads it the power to turn the world into whatever he/she wants it to be. A person deemed worthy to protect the scroll is chosen and that person is granted invincibility which only lasts for 60 years, so another guardian is chosen. During World War 2, in a monastery, the new guardian is chosen. Just as he is given the scroll by the previous protector the monastery is suddenly under attack by some Nazis, the leader wants the scroll for obvious reasons. So the guardian escapes by jumping off a cliff. For 60 years, the Nazi would chase him all over the world. And just as his time is ending he searches for his successor and the one he thinks it is, is a tough street kid named Kar. But Kar is not exactly a righteous person.
