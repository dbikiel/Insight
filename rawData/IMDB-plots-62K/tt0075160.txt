John and Howard work in a company named Safari Express booking tourists on safaris. Their lives are turned upside down when they encounter a beautiful blonde wandering in the jungle who doesn't know who she is. They also discover uranium and what appear to be some well-mannered simians.
Pilot John Baxter and his partner Howard run since two years the firm Safari Express, which has everything prepared for the tourists, even a friendly chief with the 'dangerous' local tribe. John and his tame chimpanzee find a wandering beauty in the wilderness with complete amnesia except for one unintelligible word. Shortly after a certain Mr. van Daalen offers the partners a fortune to help him supply arms for a fratricidal coup within the tribe; even pacifist John's fists can't cure Howard from the rich temptation, but he gets dangerous doubts after Miriam's resuming memory proves the key to understanding an even more sinister plan behind the coup, which John must prevent practically on his own, as the only two colonial constables are completely useless...
