A company of Spanish movie makers leaves Franco's Spain and moves to Hitler's Germany to make a film in co-production. Soon some problems start to arise...
During the Spanish Civil War, a movie troupe goes from Spain to Berlin for a joint production with UFA. Besides the jealousies and sexual escapades of any movie set, culture and politics add to the tensions: they use Jewish and Gypsy prisoners as extras to give an Andalucian look, the director is sleeping with his ingénue with no intention of leaving his wife, and the ingénue cooperates with this Nazi project in hopes of freeing her father from one of Franco's jails. When Goebbels himself plies her with favors, the director and the rest of the crew encourage her to sleep with him for the good of the production. Does she have any options? Will anyone act unselfishly?
After a mutually beneficial agreement between Francisco Franco and Adolf Hitler, a small film crew of Spanish actors arrives in Nazi Berlin to shoot the Andalusian musical drama, "The Girl of Your Dreams", under the director, Blas Fontiveros. However, right from the start, the troupe will realise that they have escaped from one war, only to find another--and above all--the hospitality of the Reich Minister of Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels, is directly linked to the warmth of the movie's plucky protagonist, Macarena Granada. How far are the Spaniards prepared to go for the sake of the project?
