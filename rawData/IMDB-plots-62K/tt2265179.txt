Documentarian visits best friend in India to see the mutual unconditional love that keeps his buddy bonded to a village hostel housing AIDS-afflicted children.
Blood Brother is an intimate portrait of Rocky Braat, a young man who longed to find a family. He didn't know it, but this desire would lead him to an AIDS hostel in India, a place of unspeakable hardship, where he would find almost more love and need than he could bear.
This documentary centers around Rocky and his best friend, Steve. Rocky has been working at an AIDS center in a remote Indian village as a volunteer and goes home to the US for a visit. He feels like he is lost at home and quickly goes back to his work in India and takes Steve along. Steve decides to film the trip and the things he sees that are bringing about such changes in his friend's life. In the course of filming, Steve also starts to gain Rocky's passion for the AIDS infected children of the center where Rocky lives and serves. Rocky many times puts his own health concerns aside as he nurses and cares for the children, many near death, whom he loves and who, in turn, love him for accepting them unconditionally despite their afflictions.
