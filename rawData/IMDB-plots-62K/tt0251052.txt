God is disappointed with the human race and wants his stone tablets back. An angel is given the assignment and, with GabriÃ«ls help, tries to manipulate several humans on earth to get his job done. But humans have a will of their own...
A truly twisted film philosophically:Though the plot explained is straigjht forward, this film makes little theological sense, makes even less sense than most of the usual human explanations of "religion, god and theology", it even seems to have been written by a Satanist or some sort of sceptic as the story indicates from the get go a failure of humans " "religion, god and theology" with that said the moral of the story is the nihilistic failures of people, the unobtainable enlightenment of humanity, and in fact states by inference that "god" working through the "angels" resort to the evils of having people killed to achieve thjeir goals when as omnipotent allegedly that would resolve all of heaven's and mankind's problems, secondly stating by inference that the paradox is that the intersts of people, god, nature, heavens and earth is not one and therefore not unified harmonious and but divided and idolatrous by stating god is not god, mankind does not rise either, that existence is hopeless and existence has and will be folly.So in the end the simple plot of god being disappointed with mankind in what cause him to want the ten commandments back seems all that weak as to allow for a number of substitutions.The author missed an opportunity to get deeper into the many inter-religious questions that for one allows any one who is not in essence to be Jewish to be Jewish merely by the questionable fact that they are maternally related to Judaism by birth.
