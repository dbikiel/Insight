Keitaro tries to confess his love for Naru.
As another round of tests approach for Keitarou, so does Christmas. And as the first Christmas of the millennium, there is a rumor that if one confesses his love on this special eve it will come true. Keitarou has decided what he needs to do on this Christmas Eve, but being a re-taker can he afford taking attention away from the tests on the same day? On top of that he is not the only one confessing on this Christmas Eve.
