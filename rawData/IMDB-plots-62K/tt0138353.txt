What's the bond between partners, between brothers, and between spouses? In L.A., Bill Holt handcuffs Sean Rickhart inside a rebar frame for a freeway pillar at a construction site; Bill's going to bury Sean in quick-drying cement. Guided by the narration of Nin, Bill's coke-snorting partner, we go back and forth over the past 48 hours to find out what brings Bill and Sean to this deadly scene. Missing money, cops on the take, Sean's two brothers (one the leader of the mob, the other a camera-carrying simpleton), Bill's wife, dead young police officers, infidelity, and Bill and Nin's partnership make a mix as volatile and unstable as the cement is solid and immobile.
Los Angeles vice detectives Bill Holt (Chris Penn) and Nin (Jeffrey Wright) have entered the gangster and drug scenes and have allied with drug kingpin Truman Rickhardt (Henry Czerny). As he tries to stop Holt, Nin narrates the events that led Holt to torture Truman's brother Sean (Anthony DeSando) by chaining him inside an iron box that's slowly filling with cement. Cops on the take, missing money, Holt's tempting wife Lyndel (Sherilyn Fenn) and dead police officers are implicated in the events.
