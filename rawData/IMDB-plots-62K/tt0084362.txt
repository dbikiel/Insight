Three surreal depictions of failures of communication that occur on all levels of human society.
A three-part depiction of various forms of communication. 'Factual Discussion' depicts three heads (made up of fruit, kitchen utensils and writing implements respectively) endlessly devouring and regurgitating each other. 'Passionate Discourse' shows two clay figures romantically intertwined, and the problems with dealing with the end product of their passion, while 'Exhaustive Discussion' shows two animated heads playing a bizarre variant of the old scissors-paper-stone game.
