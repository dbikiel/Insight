The complex relationship between a Jerusalem street artist and a mysterious, modern-day prophet being held prisoner in an abandoned apartment across the alleyway.
Rollicking, Beverly Hills Cop-style comedy thriller set in Jerusalems seamy Musrara district. Art school dropout Arnáv [Hebrew for "rabbit"] tends bar, and his just-found-religion girlfriend, Wax, waitresses, in a neighborhood bar. One morning on his way to his cannabis connection (located in the backroom of a barbershop), Arnav discovers that Schmaya, a charismatic rabbi believed to possess the gift of prophecy, is being held prisoner in the abandoned apartment upstairs.Cop-turned-private eye Gitis introduces Arnav to his client, Eiláh, Schmaya's sister-in-law, who pays Arnav 15,000 to let Gitis to stay in Arnav's apartment and spy on Schmaya and his thug handlers, who are trying to get him to write some sort of confession.At various points, the confused (but growing savvier by the minute) Arnav suspects either Gitis or Eilah of playing him or each other. Together with the rapid-fire dialog, the viewer is carried along on a wild ride through Musrara and environs, alternately working-class neighborhood by day and full of cutthroat intrigue after nightfall.The final scene is Schmaya's sons / Eilah's nephews bar mitzva party, where the freed (and cleaned-up) Schmaya dances gleefully with toker-turned-hero Arnav*, while at the bar, Wax tells Gitis how Schmaya foretold that she would fall in love with a former cop!*Think Bo in Bottle Shock.
