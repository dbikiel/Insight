After her beloved husband's suicide, a mourning supermarket worker and her best friend hit the road in Scotland, but find that grief is something that you can't run away from forever.
Following her boyfriend's suicide, supermarket clerk Morvern Callar passes off his unpublished novel as her own. With the money her boyfriend left for his funeral, she leaves Scotland for Ibiza where she travels with her closest friend. The journey prompts a series of internal and external transformations for Morvern-- ones which bring to light her experiences of grief, memory, freedom, and desire.
Bored of her impoverished life as a supermarket clerk, Movern Callar takes her recently dead boyfriend's money and travels to Spain along with her best friend to live the life of a hardcore raver. A thoughtful work of art, Morvern Callar is an intense but quiet reflection on the consequences and morality of carelessness.
