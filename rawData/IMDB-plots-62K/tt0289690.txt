From space pioneers to modernday missions, it's a thrilling look at man's quest to conquer space.
Destination Space is a terrific, slickly produced space opera with Agar and Towne in charge of a giant space station. During an attempted rocket launch, a meteor smashes into the station, crippling it! Later it's discovered that an overload within the rocket will cause a nuclear explosion-within minutes! HIGHLY recommended. 16mm.
