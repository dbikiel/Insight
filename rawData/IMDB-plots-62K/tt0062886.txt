A US Army Colonel is tasked with forming an elite commando-style unit from crack Canadian troops and the dregs of the US Army.
During World War II, a special fighting unit is formed that combines a crack Canadian Army unit and a conglomeration of U.S. Army misfits who had previously served time in military jails. After an initial period of conflict between the two groups, their enmity turns to respect and friendship, and the unit is sent Italy to attempt a dangerous mission that has heretofore been considered impossible to carry out.
A fictionalized account of the First Special Service Force, the joint Canadian-American World War II commando group under the command of Col. Robert T. Frederick. The Canadians are the best that the Canadian Army has to offer: spit and polish, multiskilled, experienced soldiers. The Americans are the dregs of the U.S. Army: misfits and troublemakers lacking any kind of discipline. Over time, Frederick forges a unified, highly competent fighting force. Initially trained for a commando operation in Norway, Frederick has to move quickly to keep the unit together after the operation was canceled. They are sent to Italy where they distinguish themselves in battle.
1942. Lt. Colonel Robert Frederick is tasked with forming and training, in a very short space of time, a commando-type unit for a special operation in Norway. This is the 1st Special Service Force. The unit will be a mixture of US and Canadian troops. The Canadian troops are elite hand-picked soldiers. Unfortunately, the US troops are from the polar opposite end of the spectrum: shirkers, criminals and generally the individuals the US Army doesn't want. There is instant animosity between the Canadians and Americans. With time short and the two halves of his unit constantly at each other's throats, Colonel Frederick is facing an impossible task.
