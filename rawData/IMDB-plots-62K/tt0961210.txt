A Mexican family, wanting to grant their Grandmother her last wish, embarks on a make believe trip to a small town in Italy ... in Mexico!
La Nonna can't remember much except her late Italian husband and the fact that she wants to go to Italy with ALL her family before she dies. Most of the family members don't have the time, money and especially can't see the point: "Why bother? She won't remember that we went anyway." -- "Well, if she can't remember let's just tell her we already went." ---Obviously, it's not that easy.
