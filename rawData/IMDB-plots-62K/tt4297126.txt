A crisis-of-faith drama about reincarnation and the power of belief.
After his terminally ill four-year old daughter claims to have had a past life, a Christian schoolteacher experiences a profound crisis of faith. Obsessively seeking answers, he risks his marriage and his last remaining days with his child to determine if she has lived before... and will live again.

Connor Gaston's debut feature film premiered in competition for Busan International Film Festival's top international prize, the BUSAN BANK AWARD, earned him the BC EMERGING FILMMAKER AWARD at Vancouver International Film Festival, and won BEST CANADIAN FEATURE FILM at the Victoria Film Festival. In the Media: 'Gaston, who wrote and directed The Devout, is an extraordinarily talented emerging auteur filmmaker. The film is haunting and spare; watching it unfold feels like entering a sanctuary of private lives, with turns and reversals that spark like precisely aimed fireworks, illuminating the story at exactly the right moments.' - Denise Ryan, The Vancouver Sun "Gaston's script is mature and devoid of facile digs at either Christianity or reincarnation, and he shows a deft way with his more experienced cast." - Glen Schaefer, The Province "Reflective and provocative, Connor Gaston's debut is one of the year's most unqiue Canadian features." - Terry McEvoy, Canadian Images Programmer, Vancouver International Film Festival
