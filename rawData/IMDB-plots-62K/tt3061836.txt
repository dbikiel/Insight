Over-imaginative 12 year-old Sam heads off to the woods to summer scout camp with his pack convinced he will encounter a monster...and he does.
Sam, 12, is in trouble: his entire "Pathfinder" scout troop picks on him - and worse. The leader, Peter, is the worst of all. He seems to find a sadistic pleasure in humiliating Sam. This year's trip is to a woods near the French border where a curious legend named Kai is said, around the campfire, to make mischief. But when Sam finds that Kai is no legend and that he makes more than mischief, no one believes him.
Nerdy, over-imaginative Sam is the laughing stock of his scouts troop "Pathfinder", even leader Peter sometimes enjoys his embarrassment, while fair deputy leader Kris protects him. On annual woodland camping trip, now on the French border of the Belgian Ardennes, the cool kids joke around the campfire about he legendary evil Kai. However there is a bloody murder spray in the area, and Sam discovers in a tree-house and befriends a strange, knavish creature, called Kai, but nobody believes him before mates' blood has also been spilled needlessly.
