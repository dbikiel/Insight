Facing pressure to marry and a disdain for monogamy, a filmmaker attempts an open relationship with the woman he loves and embarks on a search to understand why human beings practice marriage and monogamy in a world rife with infidelity.
Why are love and sex so closely tied together? And what if we try and separate the two? Filmed over the course of 4 Â½ years, Why Knot weaves the history of monogamy with the personal story of a filmmaker attempting an open relationship with the woman he loves. When his younger brother in Dubai decides to get married, Dhruv's Indian family begins to pressure him to follow suit; but instead, he turns the camera on them and begins to ask pressing questions to understand why we practice marriage and monogamy in a world rife with infidelity. Capturing histories and perspectives from both the East and the West, Why Knot takes us on a dark and at times hilarious journey through the emotional and intellectual landscape of monogamy, offering deeper insight into a universal conflict between our instincts and our morals.
