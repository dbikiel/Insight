A woman ponders over the strange coincidences that made her forefathers and -mothers meet and create the premises for her becoming the person that she is.
To illustrate happenstance, a woman narrates the story of how her parents met. It begins in a small apartment in Copenhagen, where a Danish poet worries that he'll run out of ideas. He loves the work of Sigrid Undset, so his psychiatrist suggests he visit her in Norway to talk about writing. He sets out, and there begins a tale of rain, romance, life trying no to imitate art, a slippery barn plank, a careless mailman, a hungry goat, a broken thumb, and a crowded train.
In a desperate attempt to escape the clutches of writer's block and answer some deep existential questions--such as the correlation between coincidence and our own birth--the troubled Danish poet, Kasper JÃ¸rgensen, decides to take a trip, all the way up to beautiful Norway. There, Kasper intends to meet the famous Norwegian author, Sigrid Undset; however, a mysterious string of unexpected turns will only prove that love, fate, and all those little but important things in life are always magnificently intertwined. Will Kasper ever find what he's looking for?
