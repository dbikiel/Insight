A tale about the perception of Europe in Africa... from the vantage point of a helicopter.
Seville, seen from a helicopter. We see the old - sand-colored facades, and patios and gardens and courtyards and rings and amphitheaters (the female) - and we see the new - a single-span bridge, car parks and rail yards and town-houses and man-made lagoons. The modern is bland or brightly colored; the old is weathered or green. Not too far away is the sea, with cliffs and condos, smokestack and windsurfers. The soundtrack mixes the helicopter's motor and a modern score of discordant noise. Barbieri's visual method suggests that the city is a toy model and that perception is variegated, even tricky. To see is not necessarily to know.
