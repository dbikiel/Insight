Nightclub entertainer Jean Clery discovers too late that the 'baby' he agreed to take care of is a wild, shapely sex kitten.
Nightclub entertainer Jean Clery has just become engaged to Lili, his attractive psychoanalyst. Meanwhile, the nightclub where he works is being used by a counterfeit ring, and Paris police suspect owner Paul Latour of being the ringleader. Finding it expedient to leave town, Paul leaves his "baby" daughter with Jean...who discovers too late that she's a wild, carefree, shapely sex-kitten with a talent for getting Jean into amusing scrapes.
In Paris, when the owner of the nightclub Mississippi in Pigalle Paul Latour is wanted by the police accused of distribution of forged dollars in his club, he asks his protégée and lead attraction of Mississippi Jean Clery to protect his beloved daughter Brigitte. Jean is engaged of the psychoanalyst Lily and brings the wild and rebel Brigitte from her conservative boarding school to his fancy apartment while Paul travels to Lausanne to meet a friend to clear his name. While waiting for the return of Paul, Brigitte turns Paul's life upside down and they fall in love for each other. But the Parisian police and the counterfeit ring are chasing Brigitte, but Jean, his butler Jerome and his friends protect the girl.
