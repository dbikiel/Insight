The first slasher film to be set in prehistoric times!
When a tribe of cave-women imparts cruel justice on one of their own their fate takes a turn for the worst. After discovering and falling in love with the corpse sacrificed by the girl-gang, a lone wandering giant of prehistoric myths is inspired to homicide. Consequently the cave-women are menaced by the heartbroken and bloodthirsty cave-brute with a grudge, and the prophetess among them is ignored when she predicts the tragic outcome.
