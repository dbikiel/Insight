A goddess protects a girl from an evil magician and his family.
A girl witnesses an evil sadhu attempting to bury a virgin alive, in a bid to gain magical power and riches, and calls the police. The sadhu's mother, unhappy he has been jailed for life, vows to get her revenge on the girl, and proceeds to make her life a misery. The girl, however, has the protection of Ammoru, the goddess of the village.
