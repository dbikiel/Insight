Soon after Thom starts operating as an illegal taxi driver in New York City, Claire hires him to drive her to California after her estranged father suffers a heart attack.
In New York City, Thom is broke and jobless, illegally working as a taxi driver just to make some quick cash to try and pay his rent. Claire is a successful business-woman, but personally she's in shambles trying to recover from a bump in her marriage and then comes the phone call that her distant father is in the hospital. Not knowing what to do, Claire hops in Thom's cab and orders him to just drive. And so he does. The duo find themselves in Pennsylvania and make the rash decision to drive across the country. On the road to California, there are many detours, as the obstacles and secrets force them to learn about themselves and each other.
