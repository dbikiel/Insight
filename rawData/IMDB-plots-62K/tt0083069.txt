An English navigator becomes both pawn and player in the deadly political games in feudal Japan.
In the seventeenth century, a Dutch ship sails the Pacific from the Americas in order to escape the Spanish. Pilot-Major John Blackthorne (Richard Chamberlain) is the pilot of the ship and the first to realize the possibilities of Japan. Japan is a feudal society which has a strong presence of the Portugese. A struggle is in the final stages for who will be the Shogun, the leader who, under the Emperor, governs the land. Lord Yoshi Toranaga (Toshir√¥ Mifune) sees in Blackthorn things he can use to at least survive the struggle to come, and if both play their hands correctly, become Shogun.
