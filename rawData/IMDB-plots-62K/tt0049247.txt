This is a remake of the 1931 and 1940 versions of the movie Waterloo Bridge.
Gaby is a ballet dancer in 1944 London who happens to bump into a corporal Greg while rushing to catch the bus. Greg is mesmerized by Gaby and goes to the ballet to see her on stage, but Gaby is French and wants nothing to do with Greg. But he persists and by the end of the day, she agrees to marry. But before they can marry, there is a mountain of red tape and Greg ships out while promising to marry Gaby on his return. When she hears that he has been killed, she makes herself available to anyone who would want her.
