Veteran gay pornography producer Stephen battles two rival producers over the rights to his underage porn star creation, Brent Corrigan, with deadly results.
This ripped-from-the-headlines drama covers the early rise of gay porn headliner Sean Paul Lockhart (a.k.a. Brent Corrigan) before his falling out with the producer who made him famous. When Sean decides he'd be better off as a free agent, a cash-strapped pair of rival producers aim to cash in by any means possible.
