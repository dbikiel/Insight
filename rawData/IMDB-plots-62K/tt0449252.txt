Georges Melies' best-known film, A Trip to the Moon, is inspired by Jules Verne's "From the Earth to the Moon" and H.G. Wells' "First Men on the Moon". In 1908, Segundo de Chomon made An Excursion to the Moon, an imitation of Melies' work, which is preserved with the original Pathe Freres stencil color.
