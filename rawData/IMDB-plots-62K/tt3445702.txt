Maybe pregnant, 20 years old Lissa revises her life.
Breathless, daring, and undone in a million pieces. Describing both the film's style and main character, 1/1 submerges the audience into the mind of Lissa, a twenty-year-old girl trapped in rural Pennsylvania, who grapples with sex, drugs, love and loss. When a possible pregnancy forces Lissa to take a hard look at her life, both her and the structure of the film mature, illuminating a brighter path ahead.
