From Marc's description, Rebeca realizes that cars are very close and each sees a very large field next to their car, with a group of bulls and a group of cows mysteriously running towards one another. In an overhead shot, we see Olmo's red BMW on a road on one side of the field and Marc's mother blue car on a different road on the other side of the field. Beca's parents green car is visible one the road some distance ahead of the red BMW.
