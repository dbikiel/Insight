In Uganda, a new bill threatens to make homosexuality punishable by death. David Kato - Uganda's first openly gay man - and his fellow activists work against the clock to defeat the legislation while combating vicious persecution in their daily lives. But no one, not even the filmmakers, is prepared for the brutal murder that shakes the movement to its core and sends shock waves around the world.
The lives and work of a handful of Ugandan LGBT rights activists, including David Kato - the first openly gay man in the country - and Naome Ruzindana, are presented. Their lives take a turn when federal politician David Bahati introduces a bill that would outlaw homosexuality, the actual act to be punishable by life imprisonment, and what is considered aggravated homosexuality to be punishable by death. The bill, expected to pass, is being largely supported by the country's Christian church, the loudest proponents seeing homosexuality as abnormal and against the teachings of God. The weekly Ugandan newspaper Rolling Stone, its managing editor being Gilles Muhame, is staunchly anti-homosexual in its bent, it which had previous to the introduction of the bill printed names and photographs of supposed gay men as an act of persecution, to stir the emotions of the anti-gay factions to take action. Kato, Ruzindana and other LGBT activists in the country do whatever they can to defeat the bill, while Kato takes Rolling Stone to court to desist in their persecution of gay men. It isn't until a tragedy occurs that the international human rights community enters the fray.
