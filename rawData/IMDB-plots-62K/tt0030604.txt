Porky Pig goes on a hunt to catch the surreally elusive last Do-Do bird.
Porky ventures into Darkest Africa in search of the last Do-Do bird, and winds up in Wackyland, a surreal place where the sun comes up atop a human pyramid, the Warner Brothers shield comes zooming from the sky, and populated by creatures such as a three-headed Larry Moe and Curly beast. The Do-Do finally appears, to great fanfare, and eludes Porky by pulling out a pencil and drawing himself a door.
