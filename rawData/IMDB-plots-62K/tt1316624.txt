Elizabeth Alison Gray is just your average suburban eleven-year-old waiting for adolescence to arrive when she finds out her whole life has been a lie. With only her imagination to guide her, she runs away to find the truth.
It's 1976, and Elizabeth is just your average suburban eleven-year-old praying for adolescence to arrive when she discovers her whole life has been a lie. With only her imagination to guide her, Elizabeth runs away in search of her true identity. Her adoptive mother Marion is then forced to break out of the carefully constructed "truth", to which she's been clinging, and go after her daughter. This leads to a cathartic cross-country trek by a mother searching for a daughter who's searching for a mother, both of them really searching for themselves. This movie is a poignant, sometimes funny, very female, coming-of-age story that explores the tension between creating identity, and finding it within.
