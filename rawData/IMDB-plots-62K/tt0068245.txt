A god-fearing Ohio boy dodging the Civil War draft arrives in St. Joseph, MO where he joins up with a hardscrabble group of like runaways heading west.
A group of naive boys find that life as desperadoes in the west is more serious that they understood when they embark on abortive careers in bushwhacking. Violence, betrayal, sombre colours and a Beckettsian whimsy mark this ironic western.
Several young draft dodgers head West to their deaths in this fatalistic reworking of OLIVER TWIST set in 1863 America - Jeff Bridges as the Artful Dodger, Barry Brown as Oliver, and David Huddleston as a sort of Fagin.
