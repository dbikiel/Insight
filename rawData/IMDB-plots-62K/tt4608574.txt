Danny, an ex-street-thug, takes on the Essex underworld after they turn his life upside-down.
Faded Soccer thug leads the viewer into hour and a half of truly awful acting. Hampered by the script and lack of plot. Terrible acting. Starts badly, builds to an embarrassment of film cliches, then tails away to absolute tosh. If you Survive this film and don't press delete then you are more of a man than me. (Or any of these ham-fisted 'muggy ####s)
