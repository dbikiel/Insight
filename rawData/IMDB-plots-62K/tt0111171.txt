The Gulf War, January 1991. Talila Katz, a yuppie Tel Avivian creative director at an ad agency falls in love with clumsy food engineer Noah Ne'eman. The war, with its Scud missiles bombarding Israel and disrupting everyday life, is the backdrop for this pair's love story, told with satirical bite that only Irit Linur [screenplay / novel] can provide.
