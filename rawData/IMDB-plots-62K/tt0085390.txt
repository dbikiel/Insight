Daffy Duck returns as the star of his own movie in this animated spoof of television's "Fantasy Island." While shipwrecked on a desert isle, Daffy and his miniature sidekick, Speedy Gonzalez, discover Yosemite Sam's hidden wishing well.
Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales find a treasure map that leads them to a wishing well, which for a penny will grant any wish (through old cartoon footage). Daffy sets up a resort around the well and various Looney Tunes characters have their dreams come true. Meanwhile, Yosemite Sam and the Tasmanian Devil hunt for the varmints who stole their treasure map!
