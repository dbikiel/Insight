A divorced couple's teen-age daughter stands trial for stabbing her mother's latest lover.
After his teenage daughter Danny is arrested for the murder of his ex-wife's current lover, Luke Miller recalls his marriage to Valerie Hayden and the subsequent events which led to the tragedy. The lurid story seems to have been suggested by the real-life Lana Turner/Johnny Stompanato/Cheryl Crane murder scandal of six years earlier when Lana's daughter Cheryl stabbed her mother's boyfriend (Stompanato) to death in the bedroom of Lana's Beverly Hills home.
