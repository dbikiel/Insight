This small film raises the topic of Russian cinema. The fact that in modern Russia there are practically no decent artistic paintings. But a good movie might exist. The plot is as follows: an unknown beggar actor, who has come to the casting, begins to hysterical, which turns into a bright abusive monologue about a failed broken life and about hundreds of poor people like himself.
