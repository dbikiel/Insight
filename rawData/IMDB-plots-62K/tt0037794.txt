Sherlock Holmes investigates a series of deaths at a castle with each foretold by the delivery of orange pips to the victims.
Seven rich men retire to a Scottish castle and promptly begin to die in violent fashion. Each death is preceded by the delivery of orange pips to the next target. As all the likely victims are heaviliy insured, Sherlock Holmes is asked by the insurance companies to investigate.
Sherlock Holmes is approached by an insurance company representative when two members of a very exclusive club die in mysterious circumstances. In a manor house in a remote part of Scotland, the only 7 members of the Good Comrades club meet for dinner but during the meal, Ralph King receives an envelope addressed to him and he died the following night. Soon after, a second message is received for Stanley Rayburn, a once distinguished actor and he too soon died in mysterious circumstances. The envelopes they receive contain only orange pips, one for each remaining member of the club. They all suspect one another and as the murders continue, the number of suspects is reduced. For Sherlock Holmes however, the case is not so simple and he looks to another solution to the crime.
In a gloomy mansion in the west of Scotland the seven members of the Good Comrades Club are dining. One of them receives a curious death threat, an envelope containing seven orange pips. He dies the next night in a car crash. At his funeral another member receives an envelope with six pips, and ten days later his body is recovered from the sea. Sherlock Holmes is called in.
