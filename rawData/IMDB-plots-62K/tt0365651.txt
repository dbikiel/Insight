Detective Superintendent Jane Tennison's (Dame Helen Mirren's) investigation of the murder of a Bosnian refugee leads her to one, or possibly two, Serbian war criminals determined to silence the last witness to a massacre a decade before.
Dame Helen Mirren is back as Inspector Jane Tennison in an eagerly awaited new mini-series of the Emmy award-winning television franchise, Prime Suspect. It's been seven years since Tennison put the handcuffs on a psychotic killer. Now, amidst pressure to retire, she faces a death squad that has unleashed the horrors of the Balkan civil war on London.
