Robot teachers have been secretly placed in the schools where the students have run riot. The teachers do a good job of controlling the unruly youngsters, until they go too far and some students get suspicious.
In a future world in Seattle the High Schools are one step above the prisons. In a new program to insure that students will come to class and remain alert to their subjects, Dr. Bob Forrest (Stacy Keach) has adapted Cyborgs from military research and development and made them into teachers. The head of the High School program Dr. Miles Langford (Malcolm McDowell) loves the idea mainly because his high school is rampant with gangs, and his daughter Christine (Traci Lind) is one of the students. When local high school tough Cody Culp (Bradley Gregg) is released from jail and back into the high school system he immediately is confronted by his old drug-addled and violence-prone school mates, but when he discovers how the new drug called the Edge has affected them and particularly his own mother, he begins to have a change of heart. This change of heart is also helped by Cody's friendship with Christine who sees the good inside of the damaged soul of Cody and works to bond with him. When the three Cyborgs Ms. Connors (Pam Grier), Mr. Bryles (Patrick Kilpatrick), and Mr. Hardin (John Ryan) demonstrate homicidal solutions to student misbehavior Cody and Christine join together to uncover the true nature of these instructors and discover that they will have to fight for their lives to make high school a better place.
