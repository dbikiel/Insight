Composer and pianist Franz Liszt (Roger Daltrey) attempts to overcome his hedonistic life-style while repeatedly being drawn back into it by the many women in his life and fellow composer Richard Wagner (Paul Nicholas).
A send-up of the bawdy life of Romantic composer and piano virtuoso Franz Liszt (Roger Daltrey), with ubiquitous phallic imagery and a good portion of the movie devoted to Liszt's "friendship" with fellow composer Richard Wagner (Paul Nicholas). This movie begins during the time when Franz would give piano performance to a crowd of shrieking teenage fans while maintaining affairs with his mistresses. He eventually seeks Princess Carolyn of St. Petersburg (Sara Kestelman) (at her invitation), elopes, and, after their marriage is forbidden by the Pope (Sir Ringo Starr), he embraces the monastic life as an abb√©.
This flamboyant extravaganza tells the scandalous tale of superstar composer Franz Liszts (Roger Daltry) hedonistic life of groupies, sex and music, as well as his rivalry with the scheming Richard Wagner (Paul Nicholas). After enjoying the fruits of his celebrity, Liszt tries to find true love with one of his mistresses, Princess Caroline. The Pope (Ringo Starr) forbids their marriage and Liszt attempts to adopt a monastic lifestyle. The vampiric Wagner marries Liszts daughter, Cosima, and then battles for world domination by unleashing the Viking God, Thor (Rick Wakeman), and his troupe of robot Nazis. The only way to save the world is through Liszt and all of his mistresses in a rocket ship to destroy the resurrected Wagner who has now become the Nazi Antichrist. A freewheeling, outrageous and over-the-top look at the life of the worlds first pop superstar.
