Back in his village, former war prisoner Bruno Baldi is dead set on avenging his brother who has been shot by a German firing squad after being given away by a villager. But nobody wants to give him the name of the culprit. At long last, Antonio, a joiner, reveals the informer but this comes at a cost.
After World War II, the former POW Bruno Baldi returns to his village in Toscana with the intention of revenging his brother, Giulio, betrayed by a villager and shot by a German firing squad. However neither his parents nor his friends reveal the name of the culprit to avoid another bloodbath in their village. During a religious party, Bruno's best friend, Antonio, discloses that he killed a man twenty years ago in America and has had trouble coming to terms with his actions. He also reveals another dark secret.
