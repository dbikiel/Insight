A young boy named, Jack, climbs a giant beanstalk and stumbles upon a city in the clouds ruled by an evil queen.
When Jack climbs the beanstalk, he finds himself at a creepy castle in the Land of the Clouds, with a beautiful princess, people turned into mice, an evil witch hellbent on becoming Queen, and her slow and ugly son, the giant. Jack must save the princess from the witch's evil plans and help restore the Land of the Clouds to its former glory.
