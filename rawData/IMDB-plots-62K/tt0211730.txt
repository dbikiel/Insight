Winnie the Pooh and Piglet visit their friend the rabbit. After a hearty breakfast of honey, Pooh finds it hard to leave.
One morning Winnie the Pooh walked leisurely with Piglet and composed a new song. At that moment, Pooh came up with the idea of going to someone's house. They go at random, singing the song "Who goes to visit in the morning," composed by Pooh. Finally, they come to the Rabbit hole. Although they came uninvited, Rabbit takes friends and treats them by honey.
