In contemporary Los Angeles, two millennials navigating a social media-driven hookup culture begin a relationship that pushes both emotional and physical boundaries.
In contemporary L.A., two horny (but also sad) twentysomethings millennials, Martin, a pharmacist and Gabi, a physiotherapist spend their weekends "swiping" on a dating app. The options are endless, but it's less about connection and more about hooking-up. But when they meet, they find themselves talking into the early hours. Connecting. It's exciting. It's new. They mysteriously regain their feelings and fall in love. Exhilarated by each other, they rush into a relationship. They go out on dates. They move in together. They skip work to make love - But soon the relationship becomes boring. And they decide to try an open relationship.
