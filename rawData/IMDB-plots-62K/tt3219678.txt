As voice actor Ashleigh Ball prepares to visit Bronycon, the unusual fandom of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic (2010) is explored.
Vancouver-based voice artist Ashleigh Ball has been the voice of numerous characters in classic cartoons such as Care Bears, Strawberry Shortcake, Cinderella and more. When Ashleigh was hired to voice Apple Jack and Rainbow Dash for Hasbro's fourth series to use the My Little Pony name - My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic - she had no idea she would become an Internet phenomenon and major celebrity to a worldwide fan-base of grownups. Bronies are united by their belief in the show's philosophy. This documentary gives an inside view of the Pony fan-world, and an intimate look at the courage it takes to just be yourself...even when that means liking a little girls' cartoon.
The principles of love, generosity, honesty, loyalty, laughter, kindness, friendship, even among those you may disagree with, searching for the truth, and personal responsibility are abundant in "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic" and those principles are adopted by the Bronies . . . the teenage and adult, mostly male, fans of My Little Pony! When Ashleigh Ball, voice of Applejack and Rainbow Dash, landed two of the lead roles on "My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic", she never expected she'd become a celebrity among the Bronies . . . but when Ashleigh gets an invitation to be a guest at the 2012 BronyCon in New York, she's taken on a journey she never expected to have. Featuring many different Bronies from many different walks of life, this Brent Hodge directed documentary shows us that friendship truly is magic!
