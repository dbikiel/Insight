The story of three sisters who marry men of widely different character as their individual and widely-different married lives unfold. One sister (Phyllis Calvert) is happily married but childless; the second promiscuously plays through years of an unhappy and loveless marriage, and the third is tortured by the mental cruelties inflicted on her by a domineering husband (James Mason).
