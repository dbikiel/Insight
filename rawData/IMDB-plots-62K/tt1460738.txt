Picking up from where the TV series left off, Saki Morimi is back in the United States, trying to find Akira Takizawa. Meanwhile, other Selecao begin to truly play the game, some taking dangerous measures to bring their plans for a better Japan to fruition.
Takizawa prevented Japan's destruction - and then he vanished. Six months later, clues lead Saki to the Big Apple in search of her missing friend. Meanwhile, the remaining Selecao are plotting their final move. Some of them would prefer Takizawa dead and out of the way. Some might even be willing to help him achieve his goals. Unfortunately, some are prepared to destroy everything if it means claiming checkmate in Mr. Outside's puzzling game.
