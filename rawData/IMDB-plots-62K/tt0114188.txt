Junior Healy is back as a preteen, and he falls in love with a girl from school.
Michael Oliver has grown up and moved on. Chapter 3 of the Problem Child trilogy features pre-teened Junior in love with a classmate that won't even notice him, but does notice three other boys who are rivals to Junior. This means war! Junior trashes the three boys, along with Big Ben, and even gives Dr. Peabody a taste of his own medicine at the dentist office where Peabody attempted to give Junior braces and as usual, Ben is oblivious to his son's madcap tomfooleries.
