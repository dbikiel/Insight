In turn of the century London, a magical nanny employs music and adventure to help two neglected children become closer to their father.
When Jane and Michael, the children of the wealthy and uptight Banks family, are faced with the prospect of a new nanny, they are pleasantly surprised by the arrival of the magical Mary Poppins. Embarking on a series of fantastical adventures with Mary and her Cockney performer friend, Bert, the siblings try to pass on some of their nanny's sunny attitude to their preoccupied parents.
In Edwardian London's Cherry Tree Lane, yet another nanny resigns from keeping an eye on Mr Banks' boisterous children, Jane and Michael. But then, as if by magic, a new governess--the enchanting, Mary Poppins--lands on their doorstep to take control of the situation, as thrilling adventures along with the amazing chimney sweep, Bert, pave the way for a wonderful transformation. Will the charming Miss Poppins turn chaos into order?
The movie combines songs, color and sequences of live action blended with the movements of animated figures. Mary Poppins is a kind of Super-nanny who flies in with her umbrella in response to the request of the Banks children and proceeds to put things right with the aid of her rather extraordinary magical powers.
Spoiled and bored upper crust Edwardian English family has their world turned upside down by an all nonsensical nanny who teaches them how to enjoy life. This movie is a musical and has both comedy and pathos and lots of imaginative scenes that are wonderful for adults and children alike. You'll be singing along in no time..."in the most delightful way!"
