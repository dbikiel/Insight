A count who ignores an infatuated secretary thinks he has met his match when an angel from Heaven shows up.
Anna Zador is a secretary who's been working for 6 years at Count Willie Palaffi's bank. Every day, she rides to work on her bike and places flowers on Willie's desk, but Willie (the Budapest playboy) doesn't know that she exists. "Whiskers", noticing Anna to be a sweet and beautiful woman, believes she would be the perfect wife for Willie. He insists that Marika (Willie's personal secretary) invite Anna to Willie's costume birthday party - she does so reluctantly for she wants to marry Willie. Marika, knowing Anna is low on cash, offers to help her get a costume. At the party, everyone is dressed elegantly, while Anna is in a simple Angel's outfit. Willie, feeling sorry for her, asks her to dance, but when he sees the guests laughing at them, he makes an excuse and goes upstairs. Upstairs, Willie falls asleep and dreams that an Angel named Brigitta comes to earth to marry him. On their wedding night, Brigitta loses her wings to Willie's delight. He is less delighted when her truthfulness gets him into trouble with the socialites. Willie leaves Brigitta in a rage. Brigitta decides to change, even if it means losing her soul. Willie realizes his mistakes, but it is too late.
