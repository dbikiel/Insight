An open hearted and unrelentingly energetic orphan struggles to make the best out of his life on the streets of Milan.
An old woman finds a baby among the cauliflowers in her garden. She takes care of the orphan, and calls him Totò. When she dies, he is sent to an orphanage, which he leaves as a teenager. When Totò goes out in the world, he expects everyone to be open-hearted as himself, but it isn't so. Without belongings and a place to live, he soon turns up among other homeless people, living scattered in boxes and cement pipes on a vast, barren field outside Milano. With his energy and enthusiasm Totò quickly engages the outcasts in transforming the place into a small shanty town. The eccentric misfits are turned into a warm-hearted community. But when the wealthy Mr. Mobbi buys the land he will try to get rid of the outcasts.
Next to her humble homestead, in the middle of her small cabbage patch, Lolotta, a tender-hearted elderly woman, discovers Totò, an abandoned baby-boy, who will raise him as her own, offering a shelter, her love and affection. But years later, the old lady dies unexpectedly, and Totò is sent to an orphanage, only to return a sparkling optimist and a cheerful young man who refuses to be discouraged by the ways of the world. With such precious qualities, Totò will soon find himself spreading sunshine and giving hope to a gloomy homeless people camp, without knowing that underneath the community's feet, lies a great secret--one that threatens their bright future. Can a miracle in Milan save the penniless?
Once upon a time an old woman discovers a baby in her cabbage patch. She brings up the child and, when she dies, the boy, Toto, enters an orphanage. Toto leaves the orphanage a happy young man, and looks for work in post-war Milan. He ends up with the homeless and organizes them to build a shanty town in a vacant lot.
