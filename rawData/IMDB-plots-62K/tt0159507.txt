With Harry's guidance, Jimmy trains and fights his way to the top of his division. All things appear to be on track, except for one small twist: Jimmy's parents, Don and Doreen, don't know he's a boxer. Knowing that his parents wouldn't approve of his career, Jimmy devises a fool-proof system to keep his secret. Unfortunately, Tray, a boxing rival of Jimmy's, discovers Jimmy's secret and plans to eliminate him by telling Jimmy's parents of their son's double life. Tray's treachery unleashes a series of events that lead to death, reconciliation and a dramatic conclusion that culminates in an exciting boxing championship fight.
