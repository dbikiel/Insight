The moving and at times heartbreaking humorous story of a father and daughters' journey to get to know each other, whilst simultaneously forgetting what bonded them in the first place.
When dutiful and loyal Camille decides to go on a road trip down memory lane with her Alzheimer's suffering father, she must learn to let her father go or risk losing her own chance at a life and happiness. Camille takes her headstrong father Edoardo, an award winning war correspondent in the throws of the middle stages of Alzheimer's, on a trip down memory lane, hoping to bring back the past and discover who the "Camille" in his recurring memory, truly is. As they secretly depart, in Edoardo's 1980's battered campervan, and make their way towards Bosnia, where his most recent work took place, they pick up a lonesome hitchhiker called Leo, who is travelling across Europe with his cello. On the hunt for who her Father's "Camille" is, they experience the highs and lows of a first road trip together. They humorously bond over cold soup and campfires, toilet breaks and nighttime wonderings.
