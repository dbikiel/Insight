A Soviet version of Winnie-the-Pooh. His first adventure is a desperate attempt to get to honey in a bee hollow. He is ready to take decisive action.
Long ago, it seems, last Friday, lived in one country a bear cub under the name of Winnie the Pooh. And why under the name? Because, above his door was the inscription: "Winnie the Pooh," and he lived under it. Once Winnie the Pooh went to the forest to have a little refreshment - he always was not averse to refreshment. In addition, he was a poet and in his spare time composed poems and even songs.
