A group of twenty-somethings struggle to cope with break ups, student debt, and the transition to adulthood while living with their parents in the suburbs of New York City.
Long Islanders Sal, Terry, Nate, Eric and Lina are childhood friends who grew up in post 9/11 suburban New York, graduated high school at the peak of the War on Terror, and began adulthood amidst a global financial crisis. Now at the crossroads of their mid-twenties they find themselves unhappy with their places in life. As a year unfolds, the group of friends are tested with spells of unemployment, disintegrating relationships, and the destruction of Hurricane Sandy as they attempt to move forward with their lives despite society and Mother Nature's best efforts to keep them stagnant.
A group of twenty-something friends in Long Island evolve over the course of 2012. Sal (Ryan Metcalf) and Meghan (Brianne Berkson) are married, and wanting to start a family, though they've been unsuccessful. Eric (Chris Viemeister) and Lina (Natalie Knepp) are drifting apart, as Lina wants to live the big city live in New York City, while Eric is reluctant to leave Long Island. Terry (Arjun Gupta) has been busted for driving while intoxicated after a New Year's party, and Nate (Joe Murphy) is unlucky in love, working for his uncle (Wass Stevens) at the local bar. Their lives intersect and play out as new relationships start and end, old secrets are revealed and life moves steadily forward.
