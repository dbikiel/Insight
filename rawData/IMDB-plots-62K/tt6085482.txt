The owners of an Italian textile factory sell the majority of the property to a multinational company. No layoffs are planned, but there's a special clause in the agreement that the new owner wants the council to sign. Eleven women representing the whole factory will have to decide whether to accept the company's request or not. The debate turns on, and the stories of the women, made of hopes and memories, will emerge before the final vote.
