A team of cons is planning a new scam involving betting on a boxing match but one of its past victims aims to exact revenge by eliminating the whole group.
Lonnegan is planning to get back at Gondorff and Hooker for bilking him out of half a million. At the same time Gondorff and Hooker are planning their next caper. And their mark is a man named Macalinski, who makes Lonnegan look like a pussycat. Their con is boxing match and Hooker is the fighter whom they have to make look good but Macalinski needs some convincing, and Hooker is a little rusty.
Hooker and Gondorff pull a con on Macalinski, an especially nasty mob boss with the help of Veronica, a new grifter. They convince this new victim that Hooker is a somewhat dull boxer who is tired of taking dives for Gondorff. There is a ringer. Lonnegan, their victim from the first movie, is setting them up to take the fall.
