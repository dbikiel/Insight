There is more to this story than this review lets on. It reflects all different facets of society over one drivers shift. He starts out it seems as a cold, ignorant man. But his character develops as the different people of Chicago come &amp; go. His character shows through when he tells a woman the truth about one of the huys he has in his cab. One highlight of this is the amount of cameos by well known faces who seem to be doing this film for the craic. The cab driver reacts well to the madness surrounding him &amp; you can almost share his tiredness at the end of the shift. Crackheads, stoners, posh randy lawyers, irate Pakistanis and the high &amp; lows of the working day are dealt with in this low budget film.
14 hours in the life of a Chicago cab driver is examined as he picks up fares from the good and bad parts of the city and emotionally connects to many of his passengers including a depressed rape victim whom he longs to help, but knows there is nothing he can do. Other fares include a drug runner and a manic race to get a pregnant woman to the hospital. Little is shown of the cabbie's own life and thus the film leaves us with no emotional connection to his life.
