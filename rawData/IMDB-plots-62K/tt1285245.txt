A cricketer turns kick-boxer in order to avenge the death of his brother.
Dheerendra Singh is a kick-boxer, who after beating Gajanan Dinan, has been selected to represent India in the 14th Annual Kick-boxing tournament in Kuala Lumpur where he will be pitted against Pakistan's Noor Mohammad. He is engaged to Neela Chaudhary, and lives with his widowed mother, and a cricketer brother, Veerender. The family witness Dheerendra excel himself during his bout against Noor but ends up gravely injured, and subsequently passes away after a kick in the neck area. When the Malaysian Government rules it as an accident, an enraged Dheerendra opts out of cricket, joins the kick-boxing team, and travels to Lahore (a city that was founded by Vishnu Avatar Ramji's son, Lav) to participate in the Quid-E-Azam Tournament where he hopes to avenge his brother's untimely death but is not aware of the outcome of his quest as well as the surprises that await him there.
