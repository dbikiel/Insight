Two different women - a young photo model and her boss - dream about a happy life with beloved men. Their dreams are as different as they are.
In Stockholm, the fashion photographer Susanne Frank misses her married lover Henrik Lobelius that lives in Gothenburg with his wife and children, and the naive twenty years old model Doris has a troubled relationship with her boy friend Palle Palt. Susanne schedules a session of photo shoots in Gothenburg with Doris, and once there, she calls Henrik for an encounter. Meanwhile, Doris meets an elegant middle age gentleman on the street, the Consul Otto SÃ¶nderby, who buys expensive gifts for her: a dress, a pair of Italian gloves and valuable pearl necklace. They spend the afternoon together in an amusement park and later they go to Otto's mansion, where they are interrupted by his wicked daughter Marianne. Susanne has a love affair with Henrik in her room, but they are interrupted by his cynical wife. The incidents in these encounters affect their perspective of love.
Two women, a fashion editor nearing her mid-thirties and a model who's just twenty, go to Gothenburg for a photo shoot. Suzanne calls her lover, desperate to see him. Doris, the model, is stopped on the street by an elegant older man who offers to buy her the gown she is eyeing in a boutique window. Later that day, each women meets up with her man, and seduction seems imminent until each is interrupted by another woman, in one case, a wife, in another, a daughter. Desire and self-respect, aging and failure play out in both encounters. Suzanne and Doris look for lessons learned, and an unlikely friendship evolves.
