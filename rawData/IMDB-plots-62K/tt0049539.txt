Don Pablo Salazar steals a fortune in jewels from an Indian tribe and an Aztec medicine man puts a curse on the jewels until they are returned. Years later an American insurance man, Breen Mathews (Willard Parker) promises to deliver the Salazar fortune to the rightful heir after Luis Salazar, son of Don Pablo, is killed. Breen heads for Topaz, where he hopes to find the surviving heir, Teresa. He finds instead, Louisa, daughter of Teresa, and is forced to fight a crooked group of townspeople, who are after the Salazar fortune, cursed or otherwise. Included in the group are Judge Cole (Billy House), known as "the Hanging Judge" and Barnum (Barton MacLane), local saloon owner. After defeating all the crooks, Breen is told by Louisa that she, the last of the Salazars, is going to return the treasure to its rightful owners, and lift the curse.
