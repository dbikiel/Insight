An illegal Nigerian immigrant discovers the unpalatable side of London life.
Okwe is an illegal Nigerian immigrant leading a hard life and struggling to survive in London's underground. He works as a hotel receptionist in the night time and as he has a doctor degree he practices some medicine, during the day, in a very odd way. Besides that he must constantly escape from Immigration officers. One day Okwe discovers by chance an illegal scheme of surgeries is being lead by Juan, his boss in the hotel. Juan quickly comes up with a tempting proposal: if Okwe accepts to perform the illegal surgeries he makes a lot of money and gets legalized situation in the U.K. Can Okwe keep his moral values intact?
Okwe, a kind-hearted Nigerian physician, and Senay, a Turkish chambermaid, work at the same West London hotel, a locus of drug dealing and prostitution run by Senor Sneaky. When Okwe discovers a human heart blocking a toilet in a just-vacated room, he uncovers something far more sinister than just a common crime.
