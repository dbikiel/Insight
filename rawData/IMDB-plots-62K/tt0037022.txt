Bugs, the Wolf and bobby-soxer Red chase each other around while Grandma is off working at Lockheed aircraft.
The wolf had expected to make a meal of both Grandma and Red, but is more than willing to take Bugs as a substitute when he finds Grandma has gone to work at the factory. Although Bugs is more than capable of handling a hungry wolf, the obnoxious, loud-mouthed Red turns out to be a more serious problem.
