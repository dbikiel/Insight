After waking up from his wacky dream, a theater stage hand inadvertently causes havoc everywhere he works.
Portraying more than twenty characters at once--including lively stage actors, an attentive audience, an orchestra, and an entire nine-member minstrel act--Buster Keaton pushes the boundaries of technical artistry and film trickery, in a time when effects really were special. With this in mind--after waking up from a delightful vaudeville dream sequence--Buster realises that he still is the play house's humble general factotum, and he must keep the show up and running amid delusion and disorder, identical twin sisters, Zouave guards, and a rampant orangutan on the loose. But, can a mere gopher yearn for recognition, and perhaps, love?
A spectator goes to buy a ticket, looking for money in a multi-pocket wallet. Keaton himself directs an orchestra of himself. The name of Buster Keaton is on every role of the list. Also the different actors of the theatrical performance are always him. While he has to dress a monkey, he escapes and he disguises himself as a monkey, going on stage. Later, Keaton always goes to free an acrobat enclosed in a container of water with a cup. After, he breaks the container and the water falls on the public. To escape the artistic director, he swims in the orchestral hole as if he were at sea, rowing with his instruments.
