A seedy night-club owner recruits eight violent gangsters for an elaborate heist. But when they all begin to compare notes, they find they're pawns in a dangerous game of double-cross.
A crafty nightclub owner (Jack) brings together a group of small time hoods and teams them up in unusual pairs (black man and white racist, Ivy Leaguer and simpleton) for a set of multiple heists which turn out to be an elaborate double cross against a notorious gangster (Dominic). During an extended standoff in a nightclub between Jack and his band of thieves and Dominic's henchman, the hoods discover why Jack brought them all together for what amounts to a suicidal mission.
