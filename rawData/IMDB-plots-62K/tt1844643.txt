Forced to team up with a sleazy conman to hunt down and stop the murderous Creep Van, misfit Campbell Jackson finds himself in for one hell of a bloody ride in this spine-chilling horror fest!
Life without a car can be murder. Nobody is going to learn that lesson faster than Campbell Jackson (Brian Kolodziej), a 20-something, out of work, out of options misfit in Detroit. Forced to take a dead-end position at a local car wash, Campbell sees a dilapidated 1970s van for sale. Little does he know it is the Creep Van, which is busy terrorizing the people of Michigan, creatively dispatching victims with a host of elaborately constructed booby traps inside its rusted walls. For those unwilling to climb aboard, the Creep and his Van have no qualms about running folks over or smashing through the occasional house. Campbell finds himself forced to team up with a sleazy conman named Swami Ted (Collin Bernsen) to hunt down and stop the Creep and his Van before it is too late
