A two-hour backdoor pilot of the TV series with the same name that focuses on four postal workers who take it upon themselves to track down intended recipients of undeliverable mail.
In this prequel to the series, old-fashioned gentleman Oliver O'Toole's well-oiled team for lost letters is accidentally joined by ambitious Internet age postal Shane McInerney. They bond over the tragic case of a couple in the making. A year ago, charming law firm office boy Charlie quit his demeaning dogsbody job after falling in love at first sight with Kelly. She accepted to spend a perfect day with him, yet refused to meet again. As the team traces the couple's year since, tragedy is found for both, yet they hope to help them get together, or at least prevent suffering a tragic injustice.
