Juha is a sales manager of a refrigerator company. His perfect-looking family and glittering array of modern kitchen appliances have just been featured in a magazine article, but in reality Juha is a womanising chauvinist more at home on the road than with his family. This side of Juha is well known to his colleagues in the company's advertising department. On one of his business trips, Juha picks up a good-looking hitch-hiker Maria, resulting in some of the most daring sex scenes seen in Finnish cinema up to that time.
