"I feel more like I do now, than when I first got here", quotes Professor Irwin Corey who, after starting in show business in 1938, claims to be The World's Foremost Authority. Married for over seventy years to his chain smoking wife, Fran, he is a famous ninety-nine year-old stand-up comedian, performer and political satirist. Legendary comedian, political activist and civil rights advocate Dick Gregory shares his thoughts about Irwin and Susan Sarandon, an old family friend, narrates this gem of a film in a very personal tone. Filmmaker Jordan Stone explores an intimacy rarely caught on camera with such a fascinating untypical New York couple.
