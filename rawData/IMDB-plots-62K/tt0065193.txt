Three adolescent war orphans seclude themselves in an anarchic and playful existence of denial and juvenile joy.
After the Prague Spring of 1968 leaves Yorick, Martha and Ondrej orphaned, the trio of young characters find shelter in a bombed church and construct a surrealistically anarchic existence based on a philosophy of denial of life circumstances and careless playfulness with the purpose of pretending they enjoy the peace and freedom they do not have. Each character undergoes a personal growth process after Yorick and Ondrej competitively seek to develop a relationship with Martha, which escalates to unforeseen consequences.
Yorick, Martha and Ondrej, orphaned during a war, exist in a bleak, and cynical world. The trio live in a bombed church in the center of a city. The key struggle is the relationship of the two men to Martha. Yorick develops a relationship with Martha quickly. But Ondrej, a virgin, has a harder time getting close to Martha, not withstanding prodding by Yorick.
