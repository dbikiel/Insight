In "My First Wedding" ("Mi primera boda"), Jewish-born Adrián and Catholic-born Leonora have finally reached their wedding day. Instead of gracefully embracing matrimony, Adrián spends the hours leading up to the ceremony trying to postpone it, not because he's got cold feet (or does he?), but because he's clumsily lost both his and his bride-to-be's sacred wedding rings. Disaster ensues in director Ariel Winograd's winning comedy about the politics of the proverbial "Big Day."
