Gino, a drifter, begins an affair with inn-owner Giovanna as they plan to get rid of her older husband.
Gino, a young and handsome tramp, stops in a small roadside inn run by Giovanna. She is unsatisfied with her older husband Bragana : she only married him for money. Gino and Giovanna fall in love. But Bragana is inhibiting for their passion, and Giovanna refuses to run away with Gino.
Condemned to a loveless marriage, the dejected housewife, Giovanna, sees a ray of light shine in her miserable life, when the untamed and alluring vagabond, Gino, happens upon her boorish husband's truck-stop roadhouse. Unexpectedly, the attraction between the unhappy woman and the enigmatic stranger is as fascinating as it is irresistible--and in the desperate plight of a sinful whirlwind romance--before long, an all-consuming passion will demand a cathartic means of escape. However, is there a way to flee from guilt's damned prison?
"Ossessione", made in 1942 and banned in Italy by Mussolini, is a powerful delineation of the ill-fated love between Gino, a virile young drifter who arrives by chance at a roadside restaurant and filling station, and Giovanna, the beautiful young wife of the fat old man who owns the place. Giovanna's husband disgusts her; every time he touches her she wants to scream. Gino leaves, only to return because he can't get her out of his blood.
