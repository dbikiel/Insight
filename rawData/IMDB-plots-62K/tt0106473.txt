The true story of boys being sexually abused at their orphanage ran by a religious community in Newfoundland.
This movie is based on actual events, but it says it is not all about one specific incident. It documents St. Vincent's Orphanage in Canada, where many of the boys suffer physical, emotional, and sexual abuse at the hands of the brothers who run the facility. When the stories are surfaced and a police investigation is begun, religious and political groups work to silence the story to keep it from reaching the public.
In the 1970's, an ugly scandal was enveloping an orphanage in Canada; priests in charge of the orphanage were sexually and physically abusing their young charges. When several of the boys go to the police, their complaints are buried - as the chief of police, government officials, and senior clergy of the Catholic church quietly conspire to shut down the investigation and transfer the offending priests to other parishes. Unfortunately the pattern begins anew, as the abusive priests re-start their vile acts. Many years later, victims start coming forward as adults, and an inquiry is commissioned into the cover-up of the abuse. One offending ex-priest, Bro. Peter Lavin (Czerny) - now married with 2 young sons - soon finds himself on trial for his crimes of so many years ago...and a major scandal will finally become public knowledge.
