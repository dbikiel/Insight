Our hero (Lloyd) is infatuated with a girl in the next office. In order to drum up business for her boss, an osteopath, he gets an actor friend to pretend injuries that the doctor "cures", thereby building a reputation. When he hears that his girl is marrying another, he decides to commit suicide and spends the bulk of the film in thrilling, failed attempts.
Working in different offices in the same commercial high rise building, twenty-one year old Harold and eighteen year old Mildred more often think about being together than they do about their work. They being close to each other on a day-to-day basis is threatened when her boss, osteopathic specialist Dr. Frank Gary, lays her off due to lack of patients. To save his romance, Harold goes on a quest for all who he deems the weak boned or muscled people he can find on the street below their building. And if they aren't weak to begin with, he tries to show them that they are by any means possible. Harold's efforts have some unintended consequences which may threaten his relationship with Mildred,... or so he mistakenly believes, which could lead to some other drastic action.
