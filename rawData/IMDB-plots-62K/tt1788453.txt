Henry 'Hank' Howard works as a scientist in a military lab, trying to create a superhuman formula but with little success. He is also in love with the daughter of his boss, a general. In an effort to earn his approval to marry his daughter, Henry tests the formula on himself, inadvertently transforming himself into a purple rage monster and leaving him at the mercy of those who wish to exploit his newfound power.
The Amazing Bulk follows Henry 'Hank' Howard and his mission to create the ultimate super-soldier serum for General Darwin, whose daughter, Hannah, is in love with Hank. As destiny calls, Hank will have to transform into The Bulk to save the world from the schemes of the nefarious Dr. Werner von Kantlove.
