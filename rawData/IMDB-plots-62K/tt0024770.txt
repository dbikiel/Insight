Angela, the daughter of Prince Chiaromonte, is set to marry Ernesto Traversi, a dull banker, when she unexpectedly meets dashing Lt. Giovanni Severi at carnival time. Angela and Giovanni begin meeting in secret and soon fall in love. She informs her father that she won't be going through with the wedding to Ernesto and wants to marry Giovanni instead. But Angela's marriage to Giovanni is put on hold, first by the untimely death of her disapproving father and then by the outbreak of war.
