Lady Divine becomes enraged when her boyfriend cheats on her, and descends into a life of murder and mayhem.
The travelling sideshow 'Lady Divine's Cavalcade of Perversions' is actually a front for a group of psychotic kidnappers, with Lady Divine herself the most vicious and depraved of all - but her life changes after she gets raped by a fifteen-foot lobster...
Divine leads a troupe of misfits, calling themselves 'Lady Divine's Cavalcade of Perversions' who perform lewd and illegal acts for "free". Once onlookers are lured in the tents, they are then robbed and possibly killed to support Divine's greed, lust, and maniacal need to run the show. Her boyfriend Mr. David sees divine is becoming more out of control than usual, and begins to have an affair with a young lady who wants to have sex constantly. David plans to kill Divine with his new found love's help, but Divine is always one step ahead. Divine is on her way to kill David when she is raped in the streets by a couple on drugs. A young saint finds her in the street and leads her to a church where she is molested by a lesbian with a rosary who is enamored by her. The two proceed to Divine's daughter's(Cookie) apartment where David and the new girlfriend have already killed Cookie and the remaining member of the troupe and are awaiting Divine. Divine overpowers the two, killing them, as well as the lesbian in a twist of events. She then recognizes her madness, proclaiming herself a maniac shortly before a huge lobster enters the apartment and rapes her. Then, foaming at the mouth she enters the streets in a fugue state. She rages on innocent people in the streets until a small brigade of cops and local gunmen take her down in the streets.
