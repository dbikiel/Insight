Zack is gaycationing in Palm Springs with new BF Benji who, to Zack's dismay, wants to try an open relationship. Adding confusion is Casey, Zack's ex, with Peter, his fake BF, plus Casey's fruity friend, Penny, and Zack's friend Lilly.
Zack and his new boyfriend Benji are setting off to vacation at an all-male resort in Palm Springs with their friend Lilly. In light of the veritable smorgasbord of available men that are sure to be awaiting their arrival, Benji has proposed that he and Zack open up their relationship, just for the weekend. He's not ready to limit himself sexually and explains that this will be a good way for them to explore together. Zack is less than thrilled with the idea, but he's eager to keep Benji happy and, after all, he likes sex too. At the same time, Zack's ex, Casey, is making his way to the same resort with his hag-in-training, Penny. Knowing that Zack will be there with his new boyfriend, Casey immediately goes into panic mode, recruiting his new friend, Peter, to be his pretend boyfriend for the weekend, proving to Zack that he's had no trouble moving on from their relationship. It isn't long before all plans go awry, and Benji starts making eyes at Peter, while Zack realizes he might not be as over Casey as he'd thought. With the gay boys otherwise engaged, Lilly and Penny are soon locked in combat for the attention of Luis, the resort's sexy bartender, who also happens to be the sole straight man in sight. It's complete sexual chaos as the various couples battle it out to win the object (or objects) of their affections.
