Mano has to deal with adolescence dilemmas and his family destruction, after his father leaves their house.
In São Paulo, 15 year-old Hermano "Mano" and his 17 year-old sensitive brother Pedro are deeply affected by the destruction of their middle-class family when his father, Horácio, leaves their mother, Camila. Mano is still a virgin and has a crush on Valéria, an easy girl that studies in his class, while Pedro is in love with Bia for whom he has promised eternal love. When Mano and Pedro find that their father is gay and that he is the adviser of his new mate Gustavo, they feel their world torn apart. Mano's best friend is Carol, who has a crush on their Physics teacher, Artur, and they share their secrets. In their upper-class high-school, the schoolmates are afraid of the destructive "Blog of Dri Novaes" written by a snoopy mate. When Carol kisses Artur in a cafeteria things suddenly become more complicated.
