In 2307, a soldier is sent on a mission to hunt down the leader of the humanoid rebellion.
The year is 2307 A.D. The Earth is frozen over and virtually uninhabitable. The remaining humans live underground, unable to survive the sub-arctic temperatures. With no "man power," scientists bio-engineered Humanoids that possess great strength, speed, and tolerance to extreme cold. When a rogue humanoid escapes and threatens to lead a rebellion against mankind, an elite team of soldiers, led by decorated killer Commander Bishop, must hunt and kill the fugitive.
