When a member of a popular New York City improv troupe gets a huge break, the rest of the group - all best friends - start to realize that not everyone is going to make it after all.
JACK (Keegan Michael Key) &amp; his girlfriend Samantha (Gillian Jacobs) are a perfect couple who are also Teammates on a popular improv group that perform at a struggling comedy spot in NYC. Together, the team has a family like bond but individually they have their personal dreams of being on the weekly television show "This Weekend Live".
