The man decides to kill the neighbors because they prevent him from sleeping.
Noises at night made by rude neighbors cause the very friendly and peaceful Vasily Mamin to commit a crime. The cartoon serves as an explanation as of why such a brutal crime is committed at the beginning. It is a flashback at how Mamin spent his last 24 hours before the crime.
Vasily Vasilyevich with a good surname Mamin is an amazing kind person. He opens the door to the women, gives the place in the subway to the old. The life next to the hero is in full swing. Mamin looks at the rhythm of Soviet life with pleasure. In time with the work of dozens of construction cranes, he prints reports, brings new folders with papers, processes them, and undoubtedly feels involved in the working life of the entire Soviet people. All he needs is just to relax after work and go to bed. Our hero retires at the TV, switches the boxing to the ballet and is preparing to listen to the harmony.
