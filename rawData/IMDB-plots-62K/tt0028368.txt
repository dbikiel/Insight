The two foolish little pigs think crying "wolf" on their brother is great sport. Then the real wolf comes around, with his three little wolves. He dresses as Little Bo Peep, with his sons as the sheep, and they lure the pigs into the wolf den. This time, when the pigs blow the wolf alert horn, their brother ignores it. But they get the wolf to demonstrate his lung power with the horn, and their brother comes running to demonstrate his wolf pacifier.
