The first film in forty years to be co-produced by Cuba and Japan, it recounts the story of Freddy Maymura Hurtado who was a Bolivian man of Japanese descent. He joined the freedom fighters lead by Che Guevara in 1966 and was martyred at the age of twenty five. Aiming to rid his world of injustice and the gap between the rich and powerful and the rest of us the inspiring film reminds the viewer of the need for living with a purpose. Ernesto means 'serious,' but was also Che Guevara's first name.
