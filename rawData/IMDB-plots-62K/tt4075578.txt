What if we, humans, were to expand beyond the limited bounds of our pale blue dot called planet Earth?
Wanderers is a vision of humanity's expansion into the Solar System, based on scientific ideas and concepts of what our future in space might look like, if it ever happens. All the locations depicted in the film are digital recreations of actual places in the Solar System, built from real photos and map data where available. Without any apparent story, other than what you may fill in by yourself, the idea with the film is primarily to show a glimpse of the fantastic and beautiful nature that surrounds us on our neighboring worlds - and above all, how it might appear to us if we were there.
What if we, humans, were to expand beyond the limited bounds of our pale blue dot called planet Earth? Furthermore, what might our future be like if we conquered the four corners of our Solar System, exploring and colonising far-off planets and hospitable stars? There is a vast and unexplored world out there that enfolds our home and will never cease to fuel humanity's dreams and visions of extraterrestrial expansion.
