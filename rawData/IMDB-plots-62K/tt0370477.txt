In the world of the drugs business - where it's is all about money - friendship and loyalty is most important. That is what becomes the demise of gangster Klaas Bruinsma.
Heartless petty factory owner Anton Bruinsma's son Klaas has the ambition to become a tycoon. He seizes the opportunity when American drug baron Hugo Duvall's lover Annet wants revenge for her brother's elimination. Kickbox champion Adri is Klaas's ticket in and strong arm. Klaas promised a crime empire with 'minimal' violence, but soon gets embroiled in dirty intrigues which spare nobody, so his bloody end is written in the stars.
