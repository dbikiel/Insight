Petersburg. A Selfie comprises seven novellas about the beautiful city of St. Petersburg, Russia, shot by female directors. The film tells a story of a real, living and breathing city, rather than a mythical phantasm. Each novella tells its own story about love and loneliness, luck and hope. The plots and characters in the seven novellas evoke memories of the delicate style of Leningrad cinema and the times when the old logo of Lenfilm Studios - the Bronze Horseman - ensured the viewer that what was about to unfold on the silver screen would bring a thought-provoking and ultimately human experience. A film about people made for people.
