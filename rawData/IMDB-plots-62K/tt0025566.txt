Eight strangers are invited by a mysterious unknown host to spend the night in a penthouse apartment. The eight (5 men, 3 women) are wined, dined, then greeted by their host's voice via a radio broadcast. The voice announces that before the night is over each one will be systematically murdered unless they manage to outwit their ninth guest Death. Based on the mystery novel The Invisible Host (1930) by Gwen Bristow &amp; Bruce Manning.
Predating Agataha Christie's "And Then There Were None" by a decade and based on a novel---"The Invisible Host"--- by a husband-and-wife writing team, which Owen Davis later adapted into a play, eight people are invited to a large-penthouse, with an outdoor landscape, where they find eight graves. Trapped by an electrically-charged gate by their unknown host, they begin meeting mysterious deaths. Invitees include a college dean, Dr. Murray Reid (Samuel S. Hinds, radical Henry Abbott (Hardie Albright), socialite Margaret Chisholm (Nella Walker), political boss Tim Cronin (Edward Ellis), his girlfriend Sylvia Inglesby (Helen Flint), crooked stockbroker Jason Osgood (Edwin Maxwell), author Jim Daley (Donald Cook) and a Hollywood movie star Jean Trent (Genevieve Tobin').
