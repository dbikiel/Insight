Dorm Daze unfolds during a crazy afternoon at a university co-ed dormitory in the days before Christmas break when one of the students, Styles McFee, hires a prostitute named Dominique for his unwitting brother, Booker, to lose his virginity. But Booker prefers to lose his virginity to his long-term sweetheart Rachel just down the hall. Meanwhile, another student, named Wang, awaits the arrival of a French foreign exchange student, who speaks little English, also named Dominique. Farcical wackiness ensues as a series of mistaken identities and mishaps escalate into monumental proportions starting when Wang leaves for work, Dominique the Student arrives and is mistaken for the prostitute by Styles, while Dominique the Hooker is mistaken for the student by others including the two dorm gossip queens Lynne and Marla. Other characters involve Adrienne, who is targeted by the dorm geek, Newmar, with whom they had a drunken fling the night before. Adrienne tries to find a missing handbag belonging to her friend, Claire, who is having boyfriend troubles with Tony. Adrienne's roommate, Gerri, inadvertently gets her hands on another handbag similar looking to Claire's which is filled with $30,000 in cash. Gerri is soon mistaken for a shadowy hit woman, named Britany the Snake, by a local gangster named Lorenzo. Elsewhere, Pete's punk friend Cliff enters the dorm when Pete has to go to work. Cliff soon teams up with Dominique the Hooker to find the missing handbag with the cash while the token gay student Foosball works his way through all the plots of this collegiate comedy of Shakespearean proportions.
