Three comrades graduate from Viriginia Military Institute. Bing has a chance to return to VMI as a football coach.
'Bing Edwards (Eddie Albert), up for the baseball coaching job at Virginia Military Institute, is summoned to New York City by fellow-VMI grad Billy Randolph (Wayne Morris), who is going to "fix" everything for Bing, as his father, Sterling Randolph (Thurston Hall) is one of the alumni who will make the final decision. Everything is "fixed" so good that meddling Billy gets thrown out of his father's home. Big loses the job and their friend, Dan Crawford (Ronald Reagan) loses his job, with Billy responsible for all of the trouble. They all move into the apartment of the uncle Mr. Harper (Berton Churchill) of southern belle Kate (Jane Bryan) Kate, bringing more havoc to the already sticky-situation. Billy eventually pulls a publicity stunt involving the baby "Commencent" (Peter Good) that gets them all jobs with Mr. Harper's airline.
