A bittersweet and intimate look at friendship, love and growing up. The easy life of summertime in Myrtle Beach is turned upside down for one local girl when two strangers come to town: a beautiful temptress and a charming drifter.
Two girl friends in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina find their relationship changing as they encounter new arrivals to the town. Frankie works with her brother, Neil running their family's beach-front burger bar. Frankie's friend, Nicola, runs a body-piercing shop next to the burger shop. Neil hires the life-guard's new flame, Josee, as a waitress. Frankie makes an immediate bond with Josee, which causes jealousy with Nicola. Then a drifter, who sells t-shirts from the back of his van, starts a romance with Frankie. This casts her away from both of the other two women and for the first time gives her confidence to function on her own, instead of hiding behind the other more brash or beautiful women.
