During King Arthur's time, a sword maker wishes to win Lady Linet's heart but first he must become a noble knight.
As a blacksmith John can't hope to win the hand of Linet, daughter of the Earl of Yeonil. Off he goes to prove himself a noble knight. He makes himself a suit of armor with a winged chicken helmet and runs around fighting for King Arthur as the Black Knight. Evil doings include plots by visiting kings and a Druid sacrificial ceremony at Stonehenge.
Young swordsmith John secretly becomes the Black Knight to help out King Arthur when Saracens and Cornish men plot to take over the country by mounting raids dressed up as Vikings. However, his thoughts are not only on the protection of England when the good lady Linet becomes threatened.
