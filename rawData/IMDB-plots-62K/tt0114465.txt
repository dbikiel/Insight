Dave Marshak returns to the Ski School mountain to stop his ex-girlfriend's wedding.
Dave is invited to his former girlfriend's wedding and it is his duty to make sure it doesn't happen since her fiance has plans to take over the resort once they're married
Dave has been enjoying life until he receives an ex-girlfriend's wedding invitation. Even though Beth dumped him years ago, Dave knows it's their destiny to be together. So Dave embarks on a quest: to save Beth from certain death-by-boredom, return balance to the universe, and maybe get in a little awesome skiing. Dave convinces his buddies to join him in his quest to make things right. Arriving at the mountain where the wedding is scheduled to take place, the four friends have just three days to win the ski competition and convince Beth that Dave's really the man for her.
After being laid off years back, Dave Marshak recieves an invitation to his ex-girlfriend's (Beth Roberts) wedding to Steve Longwood. Dave goes nuts and geads back up to the mountain to try and win her back. The wedding is happening on the mountain around the same time as a skiing tournament called the "Spring Blast". Little does Beth and Dave know, but Steve is actually marrying Beth to take control of the skiing mountain. But it doesn't matter to Dave, he'll try every cruel prank in the book, like blowing spit balls at the wedding party, in order to prevent the wedding from happening.
