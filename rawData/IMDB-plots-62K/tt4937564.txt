Set in London's world of high class call girls, Amoureux Solitaires tells the story of London based French escort Virgiinie, and Rupert, a man who rescues trafficked girls - A tale of modern love.
Virginie, a beautiful, high-priced call girl like a Russian doll plies her trade in London. Her protective madam Raph√§elle who treats her like a prized possession has one unbreakable rule for her employees; they cannot become emotionally attached to their clients. That's not a problem for the chicly black-clad Virginie, whose lack of enthusiasm for her job is clearly evident by her bored, detached facial expression as she services the men in a series of sex scenes that have an anti-aphrodisiac effect. But her natural reserve melts when she meets Rupert, a handsome, heavily tattooed Brit who has followed her into a nightclub. The two soon begin a romantic relationship, but it turns out that her new lover has a secret. His vocation is rescuing young women from the sex trade world, but his mission becomes complicated when he finds himself falling in love.
