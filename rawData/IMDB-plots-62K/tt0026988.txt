Dick is watching the fleet come in when he sees June. Dick has no intention of joining the Navy, which is a family tradition, and June, having lost her father and brother in the Navy, does not want a Navy man. But Dick relents when his father says that he would not make it anyway and he enters the Naval Academy. The first year as a plebe is tough, but Dick is at the head of his class. He rooms alone, as he sees no need for friends as he plans to resign when he graduates. June has also changed her mind about Dick being at the Academy. The second year is the same, except for his old roommate Lawrence who washes out. Finally, the last year and he has a three month training cruise. This cruise will make or break Dick as a Navy man.
