When Renard the Fox's mischievous pranks go too far, King Lion is forced to attempt to bring the trickster to justice.
In the kingdom of animals, Master Fox is used to trick and fool everyone. So the King Lion receives complaints about him. He orders that Master Fox is arrested and brought to him. This is one of the first animation film with puppets. The story is taken from a French medieval fable.
Predating Disney's 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' by a good few years, this was one of the very first animated features, with all the characters performed by stop-motion animated puppets. It tells the story of how the crafty Fox runs rings round all the other animals, and how the Lion (Lion King?) orders his arrest and imprisonment. But the Fox has other ideas...
