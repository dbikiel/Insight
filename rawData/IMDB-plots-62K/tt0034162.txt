After being fished out of the sea by a sealer, three fugitives find themselves prisoners of the ship's brutal skipper who refuses to put them ashore and they hatch an escape plan during a crew mutiny.
Humphrey van Weyden, a writer, and fugitives Ruth Webster and George Leach have been given refuge aboard the sealer "Ghost," captained by the cruel Wolf Larsen. The crew mutinies against Larsen's many crimes, and though van Weyden, Ruth, and George try to escape Larsen's clutches, they find themselves drawn inexorably back to him as the "Ghost" sails toward disaster.
An odd group of people find themselves aboard the Ghost, a sealing schooner captained by the hard taskmaster, Wolf Larson. George Leach is the on the run from the police as is Ruth Webster who has escaped from a women's penitentiary. Also aboard is a young writer, Humphrey van Weyden. He and Webster were fished out of the sea and Larson refuses to put them ashore. Larson is a cruel brute who will have his sailors beaten for the smallest infraction. The three try to escape but without success.
