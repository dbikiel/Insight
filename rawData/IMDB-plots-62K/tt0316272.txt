A man with telekinetic abilities meets a group of people with similair powers.
When a trio of men with telekinetic power led by Adrian Geiger robs an armored car, the skeptical FBI agents Jordan Ripps and her partner Frank McIntyre do not believe in the testimony of the witnesses about the powerful skills of the gang. Meanwhile, the former FBI agent Raymond Addison is chasing Geiger, who was a survival of his special force of powerful men, and blackmails the physics professor Zachary Shefford, using him to find the location where Geiger, his daughter Tristen Geiger and their community of telekinetic people are placed. The reunion of Geiger and Addison will lead them to a tragic consequence.
