A flirtatious Southern belle is compromised with one of her suitors.
Norma Besant, daughter of a Southern doctor, is an incorrigible flirt and has many boys on her string. She begins to favor Michael Jeffrey, who, shiftless and hot-tempered but fundamentally honorable, is warned off by her father. When Michael returns after a long absence, the pair are innocently compromised, and Dr. Besant's old-South paternal rage brings tragedy.
Southern belle Norma Besant, who travels among the country club set, has her pick of any man she wants. She has many potential suitors who she leads on, but she seems to like Michael Jeffrey the best. Although Michael is in general a decent lad, Norma's wealthy father, Dr. John Besant, doesn't like him because he is in a lower social class than the Besants and he doesn't have a strong work ethic. Dr. Besant forbids his daughter to ever see Michael again. When Norma secretly agrees to marry Michael, Michael decides to go away for six months to earn a living so that he can support her. Michael secretly comes back early, and he and Norma are caught in an improper innuendo. Michael wants to do right by Norma, while Dr. Besant will do whatever he can to get Michael away from his daughter. Ultimately Norma has to choose between her love for Michael and helping her father.
