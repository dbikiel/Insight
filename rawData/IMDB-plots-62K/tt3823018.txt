Ari's teenage lifestyle in the big city is disrupted as he is sent by his mother to live with his uninvolved father and his grandmother in a small fishing village.
A coming-of-age story about the 16-year old boy Ari, who has been living with his mother in Reykjavik and is suddenly sent back to the remote Westfjords to live with his father Gunnar. There, he has to navigate a difficult relationship with his father, and he finds his childhood friends changed. In these hopeless and declining surroundings, Ari has to step up and find his way.
Summer is nearly at its end, and Ari, a sensitive 16-year-old choirboy, unable to move with his single mother to Africa, is forced to leave Reykjavik and reunite with his uninvolved, alcoholic father and his grandmother in the distant West Fjords peninsula. Leaving behind him the big city's bleak environment, Ari vulnerable, will depart for the small fishing village of his childhood, and after six whole years of absence, he will attempt to reconnect with the unstable father, to soon find out that his only consolation in this secluded place is still his gentle grandmother and his childhood friend, Lara. Eventually, in contrast to the sheer beauty of the captivating and pure Nordic landscape that encircles the remote village, Ari's crushing isolation coupled with visceral teenage angst, will inevitably lead to a strong father-son conflict and the abrupt passage from adolescence to adulthood.
