When a street smart "goth girl" (Roxy Vandiver) is forced to attend cheerleader camp as part of her rehabilitation from a juvenile correction facility, she clashes with the "popular girls," and finds herself embroiled in a bitter rivalry with the bitchy ringleader Rachel (Julin). But when members of the spirit squad start turning up dead, the girls must put aside their differences and struggle to survive the murderous rage of a crazed psycho-killer lurking among them!
Been a cheerleader doesn't mean you learn a few dance moves and wear short skirts all the time. Now it means avoiding mad axe murderers and using weapons to defend yourself, as Roxy Vandiver finds out. She gets placed from a correction facility and into rehab by joining cheer camp, but from then on its nonstop mischief, ghost stories, chopping and slashing as the girls are forced to defend themselves from an axe wielding maniac. If you prefer some action and comedy in your horror films then this is the one. From the beginning to the end this will keep you gripped and glued to the screen. If you like such films as Friday the 13th and Halloween you will love this.
