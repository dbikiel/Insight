For two years, director Anne Wivel and her camera followed her husband, the prominent Danish politician Svend Auken. The initial aim was to portray a modern, idealistic politician with great visions for the future. But during shooting, Auken contracted cancer, and the film became a portrayal of the politician, husband and father who feels his life is fading away, even if his work here is not yet finished.
