Through the innocent eyes of Bruno, the eight-year-old son of the commandant at a German concentration camp, a forbidden friendship with a Jewish boy on the other side of the camp fence has startling and unexpected consequences.
Bruno an eight-year-old boy from Berlin, Germany is moved with his mother, Elder sister, SS Commander father to a countryside in Europe where his father powers over a concentration camp for Jews. Bruno went "exploring" one day and befriended a child his age named Shmuel. Shmuel was a Jew. The boy became good friends until Bruno was scheduled to move to a new location.
Raised in a loving family in early-1940s Berlin, the wide-eyed eight-year-old boy, Bruno, sees his world turn upside down when his high-ranking Nazi-official father is promoted and accepts an important position as a commander in a strange-looking farm. Now, their new home is surrounded by a high and impenetrable wall; soldiers who are armed to the teeth patrol the perimeter; a dangerous electric fence keeps the intruders away, and, inexplicably, all farmers wear the same striped outfit. However, on the other side of the wire, Shmuel--a shaven-headed Jewish boy of nearly the same age--has so many stories to recount, and he, too, as Bruno, is convinced that the boringly similar uniforms everybody is wearing, are, in fact, pyjamas. Wouldn't it be marvellous if this exciting new friend lived on Bruno's side of the fence?
Spoiler alert, but all parents should read before.watching with their child (children) Bruno with his family are moved to a home outside a concentration camp. The 8 year old Bruno is very niave and does not realize the reality that surrounds him. We watch as the home tutor teaches Bruno and his older sister (12) that all Jews are evil and bad. Bruno maintains his innocence as his sister becomes more.imbedded in the Nazi culture. Bruno goes exploring and befriends a young boy his own age who lives in the concentration camp. Their friendship evolves and Bruno eventually breaks onto the concentration camp to help Shmoel find his father; as they move around the camp they end up in a hut that is next in line for the gas chamber. Bruno and his friend cannot escape and end up in the chamber. Bruno's father figures it out too late. Extremely emotional. Do not watch this with a child under 16 and even then consider your child's emotional well being.

Whilst there Bruno is forbidden from exploring and playing in the garden after his parents become aware that he can see the concentration camp from the garden. Bruno and his sister are also allocated a personal tutor who pushes an antisemitic program of education to the children. As a result Gretel becomes increasingly supportive of the Nazi regime, however, Bruno is not so easily persuaded as the Jews that help from the concentration camp don't fit the characteristics he has been taught to associate with them.One day Bruno disobeys his parents and goes exploring which brings him to the fence of the concentration camp where he meets another boy his own age named Shmuel (played by Jack Scanlon) and it is discovered that they are both unaware of what is going on in the camp.
