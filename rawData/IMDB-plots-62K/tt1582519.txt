When a mysterious illness ravages a remote village, the villagers embrace a reluctant taxi driver as their savior.
The story revolves around a remote village in Andhra Pradesh plagued by a strange disease killing a lot of people. The soothsayer of the village predicts that God would come to their village for rescue. Meanwhile, Raju (Mahesh Babu) a cab driver in Hyderabad goes to Rajasthan to handover an insurance cheque to a man's family who dies in his car. In a strange situation, Raju meets a man from the village and gets to know about their problem. Soon Raju realizes he is none other than the God-sent, the soothsayer predicted, and the rest of the story is all about how Raju takes up the responsibility to rescue the village from the clutches of evil.
When a large number of villagers die inexplicably in Andhra Pradesh, an elder predicts Bhagwan will appear to provide answers and prevent any more injustice. Shortly after taxi-driver Raju assists 5'10" statuesque beauty, Subhasini/Sumita in the Rajasthan desert, he is attacked by a large number of goons, gets stabbed in the back, and is believed to be dead. Surprisingly, he survives, beats up the goons, performs a number of miracles, and is mistaken for Bhagwan Shri Shivji. Subhasini and he then part company as her marriage has been arranged with Babji/Bobby, the son of wealthy industrialist, G.K., while Raju sets about to find out why impoverished villagers are dying.
