In a Norwegian city with a 24-hour daylight cycle a Swedish murder investigator has been brought in on a special case. Sleep deprived, he makes a horrible mistake which is discovered by the killer he has been hunting.
In a Norwegian city with a 24-hour daylight cycle, a Swedish murder investigator is brought in to find an elusive killer. But when the officer accidentally kills his own partner and covers it up, a double sided game of cat-and-mouse ensues.
Two criminal investigators arrive in a town in the north of Norway to help the local police solve the murder of a young girl. A second murder sets the investigators off on an intense race where the stakes are as high for them as for their quarry.
In Troms, Swedish cops aid the Norwegian police in hunting for the murderer of a girl, 15. They track a suspect; in the fog near the sea he seems to escape, wounding one policeman. One of the Swedes, Jonas Engström, fires his revolver, accidentally killing his partner. He then tries to cover it up. Over the next several days, the sleepless Engström manipulates the evidence of his partner's death more and more elaborately as he and others pursue the girl's killer. Then, he hears from the killer, who has observed him shoot his partner. Is a net closing in on Engström? Will someone police the police?
