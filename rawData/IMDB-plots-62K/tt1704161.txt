Dean Randall has sponsored Mei Mei, a young Chinese orphan, for many years. When she arrives in Sydney out of the blue to thank him, their lives are changed forever.
Mei Mei (Zhu Lin) a 16 yr old Chinese orphan dreams of nothing more than being part of the 'perfect' family. When her orphanage travels to Australia to partake in The Australian Choir Festival Mei Mei takes the opportunity to find her Australian sponsor Dean Randall (Guy Pearce). However what she finds is far from what he depicted. Initially mismatched and disconnected the two begin a journey in search of belonging, family, redemption, love and acceptance.
