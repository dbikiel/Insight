Ever imagined what life would be like if humans were apes in modern life? That is the portrayal in this deeply thought provoking mind boggle.
in the beginning there was nothing. Then there were bionic apes in the modern age! Crazy monkeys killing, eating, and doing whatever possible to survive. I love monkeys. Ooo ooo aaa aaa I'm a monkey.Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an L on her forehead
Well
The years start coming and they don't stop coming
Bent to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do so much to see so what's wrong with taking the back streets
You never know if you don't go
You never shine if you don't glow
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on
Go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get your show on
Get paid
All that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now wait until you get older
But the radio man begs to differ
Judging by the hole in your satellite picture
The ice we skate
Is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire
How about yours?
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on
Go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get your show on
Get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
[Whistle Break]
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on
Go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get your show on
Get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars-
Somebody once asked could I spare some change for cash I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep
What a concept
I could use a little fuel myself and we could all use a little change
Well the years start coming and they don't stop
Bent to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back street?
You never know if you don't go (Go!)
You never shine if you don't glow
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on
Go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get your show on
Get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
All that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
