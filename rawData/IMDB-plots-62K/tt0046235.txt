Jody Revere (June Allyson) is a band singer working in New York City. Waldo Williams (Van Johnson) is the manager of a fancy apartment house where a murder is committed. The victim is Allyson's wealthy uncle, and since she can't account for her actions at the time of the crime, our heroine is the prime suspect.
