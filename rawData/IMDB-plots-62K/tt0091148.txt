A series of vignettes set in a huge shopping mall.
The film recounts a day the department stores of Rome. Several customers parade departments and speakers with some curious stories. The director of the beautiful shopping center is a depressed man, but he is forced to smile and pretends to be optimistic with his business; an overseer naive fails to stop a gang of thieves, although the man feels himself bully and reliable; an actor depressed and alcoholic does not know whether to abandon his stage career to risursi acting in squalid advertising.
