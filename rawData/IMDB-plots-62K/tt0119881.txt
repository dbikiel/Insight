Andie Bradley is a gymnast with big dreams for the Olympics. When offered to work with one of the leading coaches in the U.S., she gratefully accepts. When she gets to the gym, she is scrutinized by the coach about her weight and feels the pressure to lose the pounds. At first it's just dieting, but when she meets a fellow team member, Leslie, she realizes there are ways around it. It's possible to eat what you want, but not gain a pound.
