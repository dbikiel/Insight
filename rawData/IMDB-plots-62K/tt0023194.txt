Englishmen race to find the tomb of Genghis Khan before the sinister Fu Manchu does.
Englishmen race to find the tomb of Genghis Khan. They have to get there fast, as the evil genius Dr. Fu Manchu is also searching, and if he gets the mysteriously powerful relics, he and his diabolical daughter will enslave the world!
Commissioner Sir Nayland Smith of the British Secret Service asks Sir Lionel Barton to travel to the edge of the Gobi desert to find the mask and sword of the infamous Genghis Khan. Nayland is particularly concerned that he do so before Dr. Fu Manchu, who is intent on conquering the world. Before he can depart, Barton is kidnapped by Fu Manchu who tortures him relentlessly to find out where the relics are to be found, but Barton stands his ground and refuses to divulge his information. Meanwhile, Nayland, Terrence Granville and Sheila Barton, Sir Lionel's daughter, set out to excavate the site. They find the sword and mask but are also taken prisoner. They must stop Fu Manchu from implementing his diabolical plan.
