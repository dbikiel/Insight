Elmer is a dimwitted hunter who's "wooking for wabbits." Bugs proceeds to confuse, bamboozle, and otherwise humiliate the poor simp.
Elmer is a dimwitted hunter, "wooking for wabbits." Bugs is a clever, smooth-talking character, who confuses Elmer with double-talk and misdirection. Elmer is no match for the wascally wabbit, even when he thinks Bugs is dead.
Elmer Fudd is in the woods wabbit hunting. Bugs isn't easily taken in, however; and Elmer's first attempt to lure him with a carrot doesn't quite go as planned. Bugs seems to outsmart him at every turn and doesn't fall into Elmer's rabbit trap - a skunk does, however. Needless to say, Bugs outsmarts him in the end.
