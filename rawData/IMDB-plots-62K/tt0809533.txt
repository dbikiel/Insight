True story of thirteen totally normal young women that suffered harsh questioning and were put in prison under made up charges of helping the rebellion against Franco back in the 1940's. Despite of their innocence, the thirteen were soon executed without even a trace of evidence of any wrong doing.
13 very young women are unjustly accused and sentenced to death and executed shortly after the Spanish Civil War. Sad Story of the beginning of the postwar era. All the actresses are wonderful, including Leticia Sabater. Tears guaranteed. Great movie
