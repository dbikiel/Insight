A submarine commander is forced to blow up a Japanese ship with prisoners.
The commander of an American submarine during World War II sets out to destroy the Japanese Aircraft carrier which launched the attack on Pearl Harbour. His wife and child have been captured by the Japanese and they are using them and other prisoners of war as human shields for the carrier.
In 1942, the commander of the submarine USS Grayfish, Barney Doyle, is an able ship's captain well respected by his men and effective at sea. Their main target is the Japanese aircraft Akagi, which led the attack on Pearl Harbor. Doyle is tormented by the fact that his wife and baby daughter were taken prisoner when the Japanese invaded the Philippines and he has no word from them for almost 10 months. He is overjoyed when reliable sources confirm that they are alive. There was good reason for the Japanese to let him know however: all of the civilians are being transported to Japan and that ship is acting as a shield for the Akagi forcing Doyle to make a terrible decision.
