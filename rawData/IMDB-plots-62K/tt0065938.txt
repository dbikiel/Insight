During World War II, German Colonel Dankhopf (David Hurst) is captured by the Americans, but before he can be interrogated, an artillery barrage hits the camp. However, Lieutenant Kelly (Clint Eastwood) manages to reach the Colonel, get him drunk, and learn that he is on a secret mission to ship sixteen million dollars of gold to a base in France. Kelly is determined to get the gold, and plans for himself and a few of his fellow soldiers to slip into enemy territory and steal the bullion.
During World War II, Lieutenant Kelly (Clint Eastwood) learns of a German bank located behind enemy lines containing sixteen million dollars in gold bars. His platoon, led by Big Joe (Telly Savalas), has three days of rest and recreation coming, so, with the aid of hustler Crapgame (Don Rickles), anachronistic hippie Oddball (Donald Sutherland), three Sherman tanks, and a touch of irreverence, Kelly leads his men deep into French territory to steal the gold for themselves.
