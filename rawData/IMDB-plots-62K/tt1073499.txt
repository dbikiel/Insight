After starring in the Broadway smash Hairspray, John Pinette (The Punisher, Revenge of the Nerds) returns in the hottest show at the Montreal Comedy Festival. Named "Stand-Up Comedian of the Year" by the American Comedy Awards, Pinette gained wide attention for his role as Howie the car-jacking victim in the Seinfeld finale and is a favorite guest on The Tonight Show. With all-new material on everything from health food ("Salad's not food. Salad comes with food.") to family parties ("If you see a skinny person at the Pinette Family reunion, you say, 'And you are married to who?'"), Pinette has one of the most original voices in comedy today.
