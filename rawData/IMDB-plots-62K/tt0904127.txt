At the dawn of World War 2, a Rabbi's daughter and a disenchanted German soldier fall in love and are separated by the war. They struggle on a perilous journey to find one another.
1939. During a blinding snowstorm, a young man in the Polish forest rescues a young unconscious woman who lost her way, he who takes her back to his farmhouse. It is love at first sight for both. That love does not change when the two learn of the other. He is Oskar Koenig, a Nazi officer assigned to an undercover unit, the men in the unit acting as Polish farmers to discover and turn in any Polish resistant fighters. She is Rachel, a Jew, the daughter of a rabbi, and fianc√©e to her childhood friend Bernard. She thought she loved Bernard until she experienced what she knows is true love for Oskar. Oskar is only fighting in the war to please his father, Nazi General Martin Koenig. In reality, Oskar, a poet with a romantic spirit to match, does not believe in war or fighting, and does not believe in what the Nazis, and thus by association what he and his father are doing. Due to circumstances of the war, Oskar and Rachel become separated, with their love for each other still in tact. Oskar's mother, Marlene Koenig, upon learning of a Jewish woman in Oskar's heart, encourages him to pursue her, she willing to provide the resources to do so, which, if Oskar accepts her offer, would place both their lives at risk. Even if Oskar and Rachel were ever to encounter each other again, their experiences and the circumstances of the war may affect if they can join together as a couple, the war which may place them on opposing sides of a kill or be killed scenario.
