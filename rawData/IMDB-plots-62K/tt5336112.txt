The misfits who work at a 24-hour copy center in Austin have their lives disrupted with a new hire - just as the owner blows into town with bad news: he is selling out to corporate America.
In this quirky workplace comedy, 24-hour Austin copy shop manager Maggie and assistant Dan are perfect for each other, they just don't see it - even though their oddball family of employees does. They better figure it out soon, because a smooth talking new-hire named Brad may ruin things for everybody, if the owner doesn't sell the store out from under them first.
