Ellie DeWitt and Janis Zuckermann are admitted to the very strict FBI Training Academy. They get a hard course in which they learn to deal with guns and recognize crimes. They also get physical training. Ellie is a real fighting machine in contrast with Janis, the great student. They must help each other, because only when they pass all the tests will they be allowed to join the FBI.
