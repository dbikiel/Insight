A scintillating metaphysical tale, the film follows the picaresque adventures of Basile, an angst-ridden French teenager who is convinced that he will die if he falls asleep. This leads him on a road trip that becomes a hallucinatory odyssey as Basile encounters murder, sex and intrigue- assuming that some or all of it isn't a dream. Whether Basile's excursion is reality or fantasy, innocent or malevolent, grand ideas mesh with bizarre occurrences to create a fascinating, surreal journey of discovery, chance and mystery.
