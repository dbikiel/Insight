Spain, 1960s. People from a very poor family work in the country, at the service of a rich family of landowners...
Somewhere in the spanish country, in the 60s. Paco and his wife RÃ©gula are very poor. They work as tenant farmers for a very wealthy landowner. They have 3 children. One is backward. The others can not got to school because the master "needs" their work. When Regula's brother is fired from where he has worked for 61 years, he settles down at their little place... An attack against the archaism of the spanish country of the 60s.
