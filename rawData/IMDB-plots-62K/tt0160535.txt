Two schoolgirl friends drift apart when one of them falls for a handsome boy.
A bad boy can win their hearts and drive them apart even in the 1930s and even in Japan and even to Christians and even when the two girls have made a vow to each other. The two schoolgirls make a promise that is easily melted away and ignored once the western-named bad boy Henry and his motorcycle come into the picture. Their lives diverge instead of holding steady and clinging to their promise.
