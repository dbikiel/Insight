Scrooge is mean old miser who wants nothing to do with Christmas. The Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future appear to Scrooge, taking him on a journey into the very spirit and magic of Christmas itself.
Scrooge, the ultimate Victorian miser, hasn't a good word for Christmas, though his impoverished clerk Cratchit and nephew Fred are full of holiday spirit. But in the night, Scrooge is visited by spirits of another color. Straightforward adaptation of Dickens.
In the Victorian England, the stingy and cranky Ebenezer Scrooge does not care to Christmas and runs his business exploiting his employee Bob Cratchit and clients. In the Christmas Eve, he is visited by the doomed ghost of his former partner Jacob Marley that tells him that three spirits would visit him that night. The first one, the spirit of past Christmas, recalls his miserable youth when he lost his only love due to his greed; the spirit of the present Christmas shows him the poor situation of Bob's family and tiny Tim and how joyful life may be; and the spirit of future Christmas shows his fate. Scrooge finds that life is good and time is too short and suddenly you are not there anymore, changing his behavior toward Christmas, Bob, his nephew Fred and people in general.
Ebenezer Scrooge is an elderly miser who has grown hard and cold. He thinks Christmas is a humbug, only reluctantly give his clerk Bob Cratchit Christmas day off with pay and has disowned his nephew Fred who married a penniless woman for love. At home home on Christmas eve, he is visited by the ghost of his deceased partner who tells him he will be visited that very night by three spirits. The ghosts of Christmas past and present show him what he has missed with his mean and miserly ways and the ghost of things yet to come shows him what is in store for him if he doesn't change his ways.
