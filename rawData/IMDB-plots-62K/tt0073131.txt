After his family is brutally murdered for an unknown reason, a computer engineer sets out to find those responsible.
John Kinsdale is a devout family man working as a NATO computer specialist in Naples, Italy. When political terrorists kill his entire family, John uses his technological prowess to track and hunt down the cold-blooded killers, who continue to target American expatriate families in Italy. Hacking into various government computers, Kinsdale is able to identify the suspects and actually predict their next attack. Trying to prevent him from taking the law into his own hands are a local Italian police inspector, a U.S. military commander, and his colleagues, Mike MacAllister and Janice. But nothing can prevent John from meting out his bloody brand of grief-stricken revenge.
