After eating a rarebit, a man has an odd dream in which his wife takes in a strange-looking animal that eats everything in sight and keeps growing until it threatens the entire city.
As the Colonel is getting ready to go to sleep, his wife reproaches him for having eaten rarebit, which always gives him strange dreams. Sure enough, the Colonel soon has a dream, in which his wife takes in an odd stray animal. In his dream, the new pet has an insatiable appetite - but what really causes trouble is that every time it eats something, it immediately gets larger.
