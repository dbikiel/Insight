Two teens battle their way through a religious apocalypse on a mission to defeat the Antichrist.
The rapture has happened and Lindsey (Anna Kendrick), her boyfriend Ben (John Francis Daley), and their families have been left behind, doomed to endure torture on Earth. A former politician named Earl Gundy (Craig Robinson), now known as The Beast, is the Anti-Christ. But when The Beast decides he wants to take Lindsey as his wife, Lindsey and Ben most come up with a plan to defeat the Anti-Christ.
A year after the Rapture has removed much of humanity from Earth and the planet has been rendered as a hellish proving ground, Ben and Lindsey try to reestablishing their sandwich cart business. Beyond the occasional blood rainstorm and talking locusts that surface occasionally, the sandwich sellers have a new problem: the Anti-Christ decides he wants to take Lindsey as his bride.
