Torn by personal guilt, Italian General Umberto Nobile reminisces about his 1928 failed Arctic expedition aboard the airship Italia.
The commander of a failed 1928 Arctic airship expedition is remembering the events of the "Italia" airship flight, crash, and subsequent rescue efforts. The "ghosts" of people involved in the events appear in his memories to assist him in determining his guilt in the affair. The reminiscences are mixed with the real action: the flight of the "Italia", the air rescue operation from Kings Bay airfield, the expedition of the "Krassin" ice-breaker. A sort of human touch is added by the ever beautiful C.C. playing Malmgren's girlfriend.
As the leader of a 1928 Arctic airship expedition watches a television program about the disastrous undertaking, the ghosts of those involved in the voyage and subsequent rescue attempts gather to determine his guilt in the affair. Most of this movie is a flashback to the voyage and the international efforts to rescue the crew of the airship from an ice flow.
