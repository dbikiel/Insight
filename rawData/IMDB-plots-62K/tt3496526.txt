A driven, overworked and sleep deprived TV News woman's life is derailed when she inherits a house and dog in a small quirky town.
Meet Nicole. She works the overnight shift at a TV news network in Washington, DC. Even though Nicole is sleepy most all the time, she really loves her job, to the exclusion of most other things. Don't give Nicole a plant; it won't survive. Nicole's uncle who lives in a small town dies suddenly. When she attends the funeral, Nicole discovers that he left her both his house and his dog. Responsibilities she didn't seek and doesn't want. Nicole decides to keep Charlie the dog, but sell the house.
