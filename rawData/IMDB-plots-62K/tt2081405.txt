'Too Sane For This World' explores the challenges, gifts and unique perspectives of 12 adults on the autism spectrum. The film features an introduction by Dr. Temple Grandin. Many adults on the autism spectrum discover their condition much later in life, some being diagnosed as late as the age of forty. Knowing that you are on the spectrum can bring a great relief and understanding of oneself, but also a label that brings it's own set of societal discrimination's. The questions for the interviews were devised by adults on the spectrum, and this film is a collaboration between nerotypical and A-typical filmmakers. 'Too Sane For This World' is about exhibiting the strengths, discussing the challenges and exposing the immediate need for society to address the concerns within the autism community.
