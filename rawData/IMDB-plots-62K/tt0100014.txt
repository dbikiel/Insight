They only have 36 days left to do this and would like to spend this time in peace in a small village where women pray to a god of fertility, Wu tung. One sister visits the god's temple and thinks lustful thoughts. As she leaves, a priest confronts her, warning of dire consequences and of demons that will try to stop the vixens' transformation. Soon, the youngest sister saves a poor young scholar from bandits and becomes enamored of him. Each sister visits him, and before long, he makes love to all three. After they invite him to stay with them, the playfulness takes a scary turn. Where can they turn for help?
