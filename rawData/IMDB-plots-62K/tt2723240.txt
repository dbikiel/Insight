Öllers and Niederländer have everything under control. For the
past six years, the two successful business consultants have
been traveling through some of the seediest countries around
the world in order to satisfy their clients greed. They have
achieved almost everything, but there is one career move left:
to finally become a partner in the company!
When they find out that their team colleague Hellinger made
the cut, they are at their wits end. Up or Out is the name of
the game. The fact that Hellinger falls from an office window
for no explainable reason doesnt seem to help the situation.
Of all people, the young and ambitious Bianca steps in for
Hellinger. Öllers and Niederländer are irritated, sarcasm
spreads, neuroses break out. The fight for survival within the
company takes its toll the AGE OF CANNIBALS dawns.written by German Films
