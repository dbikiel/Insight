Fate brings a young man from rural Kerala to be the protector of a young Lama in Nepal, who is being chased by a dangerous cult.
A young Tibetan lama, Rinpoche is pursued into hiding in Nepal by an evil cult leader (Puneet Issar). Meanwhile, Ashokan (Mohanlal) and Appukuttan (Jagathi) are cousins in a constant game of one-upmanship in their village. An astrologer's advice results in the two landing up in Nepal to seek their fortunes, while vying for the hand of anthropologist/photographer Aswathi (Madhoo). Rinpoche ends up in Ashokan's care, who with Aswathi must protect him from the cult.
Ashokan is a village fellow who is always in competition with his cousin Appukkuttan. Ashokan is sent to Nepal to meet his uncle as an astrologer predicts that if he stays at home, he will commit a murder. Once there, he finds that Appukuttan has already reached there claiming that he was Ashokan. There, he loses his luggage and is shunned off to streets where he is joined by the Rinpoche, the Sacred Boy of one of the monasteries, who escaped from his tormentors. The evil forces try to kidnap the child, and Mohanlal is drawn into the fight.
