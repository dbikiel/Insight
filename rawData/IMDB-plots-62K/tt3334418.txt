Vampires have just made themselves public. Now a group of documentarians have been granted access to learn how they live and coexist with humans. But as reality sets in, the crew realize their very lives are in danger.
Little by little, humankind has come to understand that vampirism is not only a real medical condition caused by a transmuting virus but also that the dreaded blood-suckers of fiction are living among us. However, in an attempt to publicly reconcile relations between species, vampire ambassadors embark on a daring media campaign to reassure the world that hunting mortals for sustenance is so passé--and what better way to prove it--than allowing an in-depth exposé on their painfully ordinary existence. For such an important task, an intrepid three-member crew of documentarians are invited to spend a week with a typical vampire household--but, soon--minor slips of the tongue will quickly crumble the friendly facade. But really though, who said this was a good idea?
