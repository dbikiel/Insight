An elderly monk, while training the young novice who will succeed him, recalls the mysterious lost love of his past - just as his young successor appears to be encountering her himself.
In spring, during the ice drift, a young monk sees a mermaid in the river for the first time. Then she appears to him again, wanting to drag him under the water. Another monk, an elderly man, seeing this, understands that a mermaid is a girl who had been deceived by him in his youth and drowned. When a mermaid tries to drown a young monk during a thunderstorm, the old man enters into a fight with her, and both die.
