Father Frost has never witnessed summer, so he decides to travel to the big city during the hottest of the seasons.
Having asked the children about the summer at the New Year's party, Father Frost actually didn't understand anything really. Returning to his home to the north, he now began to paint all New Year's toys in an incomprehensible green color, singing an incomprehensible song about an incomprehensible summer. Tormented all winter, Father Frost decides to get into the city and see the summer with his own eyes.
