With the power of a magic crystal, a TV hostess becomes the only hope to defeat a malign subterranean entity, that is sick of her good, generous deeds.
Baixo Astral, an evil spirit who lives in the sewers, and whose mission is to bring unhappiness to this world, hears Xuxa on TV asking children to fight for a better world. Threatened by those words, he declares war on her and devises a plan to overcome her, helped by his allies Titica and Morceg√£o. Among other things, she will have to rescue her little dog from his evil hands.
