CEO Lucy takes her staff on corporate team building in some underground desert caves in New Mexico. They get stuck there.
Lucy (Demi Moore) is the egotistical megalomaniac CEO of Incredible Edibles, America's premier provider of edible cutlery. In her infinite wisdom, Lucy leads her staff including her long-suffering assistants, Freddie (Karan Soni) and Jess (Jessica Williams), on a corporate team-building caving weekend to New Mexico. When disaster strikes, not even their useless guide, Brandon (Ed Helms), can save them. Trapped underground by a cave-in, this mismatched and disgruntled group must pull together in order to survive.
Team-building trips are the work of the devil. And if you think that's not true, try telling it to the staff from the cosmetics company run by the self-centered Lucy Vanderton, sent on a day-trip that ends with all of them trapped in a cave; an ideal scenario for labor unrest to literally lead to cannibalism. The director of Creep orchestrates a very black comedy headed by a wonderfully detestable Demi Moore.
