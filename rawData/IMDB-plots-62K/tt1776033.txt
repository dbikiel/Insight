In Los Angeles during the holiday season. David (David Guy Levy), a painter, and Enci (Lili Bord√°n), a Hungarian nanny, meet in a bookstore when he catches her shoplifting on his ever-present flip camera. As they start a tentative relationship, he captures it all on his digital camera, though nothing about the situation is as straightforward as it seems.
