An ex-logger comes to the aid of a woman who returns to her hometown in the Pacific Northwest and finds herself harassed and stalked by a former cop turned crime lord.
A modern fable set against the rugged backdrop of a Pacific Northwest logging community, this is the story of Lillian (Julia Stiles), a young woman newly returned to her hometown who becomes the subject of harassment by a man named Blackway (Ray Liotta), an ex-cop turned violent crime lord who operates with impunity in this small community on the edge of the wilderness. Forsaken by the local townspeople, advised by Sheriff Wingate (Dale Wilson) to leave town, Lillian decides instead to take a stand against her sociopathic stalker, and enlists the help of an ex-logger Lester (Sir Anthony Hopkins) and his laconic young sidekick Nate (Alexander Ludwig), the only two men in town brave enough, or crazy enough, to go with her, and go up against Blackway.
