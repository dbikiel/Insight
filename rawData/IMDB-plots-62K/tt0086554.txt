Life accidentally pushed two people. A former sportsman, now a sharp grinder, a hard worker, but a charming young man Igor and a librarian Vera, an outwardly unattractive but heartfelt girl who has fallen from hopeless carousels, conclude an agreement: using auto-training to fall in love with each other, but when they have none of this did not work out, they fell in love with each other sincerely, without any auto-training.
