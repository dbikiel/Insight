In a post-apocalyptic New York City, a policeman infiltrates the Bronx Warriors, which has become a battleground for several murderous street gangs. It's the dead of night, and nobody at all is on the street. On the other side of the bridge, a Manhattan runaway, girl named Young Ann is attacked by a gang of street hockey players! These guys are on roller skates, dressed in fiberglass safety gear, and are wielding hockey sticks as weapons. They chase Young Ann into a dead end and surround her, but then they are themselves surrounded by a much tougher-looking gang who at least have the self-respect to ride motorcycles. In the middle of this chaos, gang leader Trash steps in to take care of her.
It's 1990 and the Bronx has officially been declared a "No Man's Land" devoid of any laws. A wealthy young woman runs away from her Manhattan boarding school into this wasteland of motorcycle gangs, marauding warriors, and degenerate street trash. There she takes up with this motorcycle gang called The Riders and their leader named Trash. Her corrupt father sends a ruthless mercenary to bring her back at all cost.
