Domineering Harriet Craig holds more regard for her home and its possessions than she does for any person in her life. Among those she treats like household objects are her kind husband Walter, whom she has lied to about her inability to have children; her cousin Claire, whom she treats like a secretary; and her servants whom she treats like slaves.
Harriet Craig (Joan Crawford) enjoys the married life but constantly tries to control those around her. She does not trust her husband, Walter (Wendell Corey), without checking up on him. When he is offered a promotion that will require traveling,Harriet tells his boss that Walter has a gambling problem. She also sabotages a budding relationship between her cousin Claire and West Miller, Walters assistant. However, Walter discovers Harriet's interference, which leads to a confrontation.
