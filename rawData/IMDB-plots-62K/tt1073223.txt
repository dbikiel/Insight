Multiple murders has been committed while the Black Organization members are roaming around Conan and his friends. Are they responsible for the killings? Or Is it someone else?
In Tokyo, two new skyscraper are built. Conan and his friends get a private tour of these new buildings. A few days later Ohki Iwamatsu, a builder of the towers, was found killed in his apartment. Now the search is on for the murderer.
Tokiwa Twin Tower, one 319km and 2nd 294km, are built in Tokyo. Kogoro was invited to visit. Conan also went there too. Ohki modified Congress Rules and made Twin Tower possible to build. Gin and Vodka sneak into Miyano Akemi's temporary rented flat and eavesdrop Shiho's message that Shiho would go to twin tower to visit together with Kudo Shinichi. Gin and Vodka decided to set Twin Tower as Shiho's guillotine. But could they succeed? Sonoko Suzuki used that 10yr photo machine and changed to Shiho's Wavy Hair. Soon after, Ohki was killed. Police suspected Tokiwa Mio, but until Mio Tokiwa got hung on the "Spring Snow Fuji" gallery, police knew Tokiwa was not Culprit. Finally, who was the culprit? Sonoko became like Shiho due to the new wave haircut. Gin and Vodka... Finally Sherry(Shiho) was safe.
