A man and a woman sharing a psychic link meet and fall in love, but the woman's influential and powerful husband stands in their way.
Moira is married to an abusive husband, who is having an affair with his secretary. On top of it she is troubled by recurrent dreams of running into a mysterious man waiting for her, and they always end up making love. Moira visits an astrologer to interpret her dreams, and is always brought a shy close to her dream lover, but never realizing it. Meanwhile, the man - whose name is Richard - has been having similar dreams. One day, she sees the same house she has been seeing in her dreams, where Richard happens to be working as a renovator. They both become captivated with each other, go back to Richard's place, and have an affair. They realize that they are meant for each other. But they also know that if Moira's husband gets a whiff of their relationship he won't stand it and make life hell for both of them, so he must be gotten out of their way somehow.
