In 1923 London, socialite Clarissa Dalloway's (Vanessa Redgrave's) well-planned party is overshadowed by the return of an old suitor she had known thirty-three years earlier.
London, summer 1923. Clarissa (Vanessa Redgrave), Member of Parliament Richard Dalloway's (Sir John Standing's) wife, sets out on a beautiful morning; she's shopping for flowers for her party that evening. At the same time Septimus Warren Smith (Rupert Graves), a young man who survived the battlefields of Europe, is suffering from a nightmarish delayed on-set form of shell shock. Clarissa's nearly-grown daughter is distant, and preoccupied. In the course of one day, Peter (Michael Kitchen), Clarissa's passionate old suitor, returns from India and is invited to her party, Septimus commits suicide, Clarissa relives a day in her youth (and her reasons for her choice of a life with the reliable Richard Dalloway).
London 1923. Clarissa Dalloway (Vanessa Redgrave) is preparing for a party that evening. While the maid is preparing the house, Mrs. Dalloway is going to buy the flowers. On her walk through London, England, she thinks about her youth when she and her friend Sally (Lena Headey) lived with their parents in Bourton, England. There she had a friend, Peter Walsh (Alan Cox), who wanted to marry her. Although she loved him, she decided not to marry him, but to marry Richard Dalloway (Robert Portal). Peter Walsh (Michael Kitchen) came back the day before out of India, and later that day, he calls at her house to talk with her. They still feel a lot for one another, and the rest of that day, they think of the time in Bourton. We also follow Septimus Warren Smith (Rupert Graves), a veteran of World War I. This war gave him a very traumatic experience which leads him to kill himself. Then the party starts, and she doesn't like it, until the party seems to turn right after all.
