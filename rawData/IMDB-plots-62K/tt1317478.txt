Goku and his family and friends encounter Vegeta's brother, and a threat from Vegeta's past shows up and causes trouble.
It is two years after the defeat of Majin Buu, and Earth is enjoying a time of peace. Mr. Satan invites all of the Z Fighters to a banquet celebrating the opening of his hotel, but while they are enjoying themselves, they are interrupted by the arrival of Tarble, brother of Vegeta, and Tarble's wife. Tarble tells them how two fighters, formerly henchmen of Frieza, are terrorizing the planet that he now lives on, and he asks for their help in vanquishing these new foes.
