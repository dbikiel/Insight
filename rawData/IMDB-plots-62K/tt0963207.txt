It's Bad For Ya, Carlin's Emmy-nominated 14th and final HBO special from March of 2008 features Carlin's noted irreverent and unapologetic observations on topics ranging from death, religion, bureaucracy, patriotism, overprotected children and big business to the pungent examinations of modern language and the decrepit state of the American culture. Carlin once again comes up with an hour of brand new material that not only makes you laugh, but makes you think. George Carlin will always remain part of the popular lexicon for his 'Seven Dirty Words' routine, and as a comedian who was never afraid to challenge his audience.
