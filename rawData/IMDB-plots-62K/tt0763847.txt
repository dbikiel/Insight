Relationship issues arise between a researcher with a theory to explain away all his failed dating experiments, a player who wants out of the game, a deejay whose head spins with thoughts of God, a hoodrat with no street cred, a poet not-so-well-versed in art of love, and a womanipulator of men.
Xs &amp; Os is a hip romantic comedy that takes a humorously genuine look at post-college relationships. A circle of friends in San Francisco finds out the hard way that it s not all hugs and kisses in the game of love and that everyone needs a strategy to score. Bookish biologist Simon (Clayne Crawford - 'A Walk to Remember') lusts after Jane (Sarah Wright - 'The House Bunny'), a blonde beauty who barely knows he exists. Against the advice of his womanizing best friend, Lorenzo (Warren Christie - TV's "October Road"), Simon decides to make Jane jealous by dating his lab partner, Trese (Judy Marte - 'Raising Victor Vargas'). But every part of Simon's plan falls apart, trapping him between the pursuit of a hopeless dream and unexpected, real feelings for someone.
