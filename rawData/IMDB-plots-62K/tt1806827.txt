Mr Olivares has already recovered, but now he needs a vacation. To go to some heavenly place where he can relax and blithely enjoy himself.
Uptight and stressful Mr. Olivares is in need for some much needed rest and, on doctors orders, takes a holiday, to the seaside, to relax and enjoy himself for a while. In doing so, he unwittingly vacates in the same location where the beach is invaded by sea demons who rip, tear and mutilate its inhabitants. This doesn't seem to bother the anxiety ridden man until his Walkman's batteries run-dry and the real hell is unleashed...brutally.
