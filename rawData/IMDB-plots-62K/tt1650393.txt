A cocky young man travels to Oregon to work on an apple farm. Out of his element, he finds his lifestyle and notions being picked apart by everyone who crosses his path.
Leaving the ivy-covered walls of Yale behind, the privileged and intellectual Samuel sets out to discover the real world armed with books and a strong conviction of atheism. He goes to work at an apple orchard under an alias, but is thrust into a world he is wholly unprepared for with religious locals and untrustworthy co-workers. His sexuality and lack of faith will be tested as he learns to rely on strangers in a world that can't be taught in books and a classroom.
After graduating from grad school at Yale in his home state of Connecticut, David, not knowing what to do and not wanting to go home in having an issue with his mother, decides to head west with his "girlfriend" Jennifer to get a manual labor job picking apples in Oregon, Jennifer who, at the last minute, decides instead to follow him shortly after he takes the bus cross country. Although seeing himself as an intellectual, David may or may not be aware of just how lost he is emotionally. In Oregon, he tries to distance himself from everyone he meets in giving them a false name - Samuel - yet he craves human connection lamenting whenever those connections don't happen. Because of Jennifer, David decides to extend his stay in Oregon as he moves from situation to situation out of circumstance. As he tries to make those human connections in navigating this part of his life, his encounters with two people arguably expose his life for what it is: Brian, nicknamed Curly, a forklift operator at an apple processing plant; and Jon, a war vet, recovering alcoholic, stone mason (who is making clocks out of jade in the shape of a map of Oregon to sell at an upcoming craft fair), and born again Christian, which potentially places him at odds with avowed atheist David.
