We open with stories of one man's brilliant idea to remake the science fiction classic, _Fly, The (1958)_, into a whole new entity. The end result was David Cronenberg's _Fly, The (1986)_ that revolutionized the genre. Nearly every aspect of the filmmaking process is covered in this mammoth documentary, and in great detail. Sadly, the only thing missing here are some new interviews with Cronenberg himself.
