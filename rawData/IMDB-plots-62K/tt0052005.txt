Will Stockdale is a country bumpkin drafted into the Air Force and too dumb to realize he's driving everyone around him crazy, no one more than Sergeant King.
Hillbilly, Will Stockdale, drafted into the United States' Air Force, combines crushing naivety, stubbornness, a completely literal mind, and amazing physical strength. Will the Air Force survive all the numerous experiences?
Will Stockdale, a country bumpkin from Georgia, has just been drafted into the Air Force. A simple-minded man, Will befriends fellow recruit Ben Whitledge, a slight, unassuming man who dreams of being transferred into the infantry, where all his brothers served and where generations of his family before him have served. Their friendship is based on being the outsiders amongst the draftees. Because of his simple-mindedness, Will ends up driving all those around him crazy, but none more so than his barracks sergeant, Orville King. Sergeant King, a career military man, is one who survives in the military by not making waves and by having those under him not make waves as to stay under the radar of those higher up. But Sergeant King may not be able to stay under the radar while Will is under his command. Will, along with Ben, gets Sergeant King into one predicament after another, Will often not even realizing he is doing so or that Sergeant King is in a bind unless told by someone else. These predicaments culminate in an incident which could jeopardize the careers of many a general and Will's "good friend", Sergeant King.
