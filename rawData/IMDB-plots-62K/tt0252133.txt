A group of female friends in San Francisco investigate a serial killer targeting newlyweds.
A homicide inspector -- Lindsay Boxer -- who teams with three other professional women to catch an ingenious serial killer targeting newlyweds on their wedding nights. But while Boxer is trying to solve the biggest case of her career, she is also falling in love with her partner -- and privately waging her own battle with a life-threatening illness.
Great murder mystery movie, with a very suprise ending. Reading the book before seeing the movie is recomended. Both are equally great, book however is much better. One does admit that the movie and book are very closely related, but recomends book because it does have some minor details that movie doesn't.
