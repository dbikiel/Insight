An isolated community of superhumans fight to protect themselves.
The Inhumans have always been one of Marvel's most enduring oddities. A race of genetic outsiders, they live secluded in their island kingdom of Attilan, preferring not to mix with the outside world. Even stranger, their genetic mutations are self-endowed; each Inhuman, as a coming-of-age ritual, endures exposure to the Terrigen Mists, a strange substance that imparts unearthly powers--some extraordinary, some monstrous. But now the kingdom of Attilan is under attack from without and within. Can the Royal Family, led by Black Bolt, repel the foreign invaders who blast at their outer defenses, as well as the internal threat of Black Bolt's insane brother, Maximus the Mad? This popular series takes a classic Marvel cast of characters, and infuses it with a modern sensibility that includes international politics and an awareness of class systems. Dark and grimly compelling, the "Inhumans" is one story that won't be forgotten any time soon.
The first two episodes are set to air in IMAX theaters September 1st before premiering on ABC. The series will follow the royal family of Inhumans, led by their King, Black Bolt (Anson Mount), after they are split up by a military coup and end up in Hawaii in the latest television series set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
