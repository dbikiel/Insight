In the 1920s, enterprising Louise Randall is determined to succeed in a man's world. She enrolls at business college but her plans for a career change when she falls in love with handsome Rodney Crane. Although the two have little in common and Rodney disagrees with Louise's views on the woman's role in society, they marry and have four children. Their personality differences eventually lead to a divorce. Louise eventually finds happiness with her second husband, eccentric Harold Pierson.
Louise Randall is an independent woman whose "glass is half full" mentality was passed onto her from her father. Louise hopes that those around her, especially her children, have that same ethic of life. Louise learns that if she is ever to find true love in her life, she will have to have a special man who has the same outlook, and that she can't mold others to that mentality. She finds such a man in the form of Harold Pierson, her second husband who most see as being unreliable and non-driven. But together, Louise and Harold and their children try one business venture after another, some with success, some without. World events such as World War I, the Great Depression and World War II affect what happens to the family and their ventures.
