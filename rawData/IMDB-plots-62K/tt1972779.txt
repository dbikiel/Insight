Approaching forty, Dawson Cole, a Gulf coast oil rig worker who miraculously survived a recent explosion on the rig on which he was working, and Amanda Reynolds n√©e Collier, a housewife and mother, were high school sweethearts, they having gotten together in their senior year. Their relationship was despite the differences in their social standing, Amanda coming from an upper middle class family, and Dawson being from the backwoods, he who was physically and emotionally abused by his drug running father, Tommy Cole. After not seeing each other for twenty-one years, Dawson and Amanda are reunited in returning to their small Louisiana hometown upon the death of their mutual friend, mechanic Tuck Hostetler, at age ninety-two, he who was the father that Dawson never really had. It was due to tragic circumstances that Dawson and Amanda never stayed together past their senior year, and as such there are unresolved emotions each has about their relationship. However, them getting back together has many obstacles, most specifically in overcoming the tragedies that led to their separation, and Amanda's current marital status. Regardless of Dawson, Amanda may have already potentially left her husband, Frank Reynolds, due to his drinking and non-supportive nature, if it wasn't for their son, Jared Reynolds, who is just graduating from high school. In marrying Frank, Amanda never completed her post-secondary schooling, her dream at the time to become a lawyer. But in returning to their hometown, Dawson may be most affected by his unsavory past, which may come back to haunt him.
