A lovable but introverted penguin named Hubie (Martin Short) plans to present his betrothal pebble to the bird of his dreams.
He must present his special pebble to her before the pebble festival is over, or lose his chance forever. He just manages to pluck up the nerve, when the evil Drake (Tim Curry) knocks him off the ice, and Hubie (Martin Short) is swept away. Picked up and caged by a ship, he meets the streetwise Rocko (Jim Belushi), whose only wishes are to live in sunny climates and learn to fly. Together they escape, and Hubie convinces Rocko to help him find Antarctica. When they reach the home ice, Hubie must defeat his worst enemy, and Rocko must face up to the reality of his dream of flying.
