The Nazis set up a secret base on the dark side of the moon in 1945 where they hide out and plan to return to power in 2018.
In the last moments of World War II, a secret Nazi space program evaded destruction by fleeing to the Dark Side of the Moon. During 70 years of utter secrecy, the Nazis construct a gigantic space fortress with a massive armada of flying saucers. When American astronaut James Washington puts down his Lunar Lander a bit too close to the secret Nazi base, the Moon Führer decides the glorious moment of retaking the Earth has arrived sooner than expected. Washington claims the mission is just a publicity stunt for the President of the United States, but what else could the man be but a scout for the imminent attack by Earth forces? The Fourth Reich must act. Two Nazi officers, ruthless Klaus Adler and idealistic Renate Richter, travel to Earth to prepare the invasion. In the end when the Moon Nazi UFO armada darkens the skies, ready to strike at the unprepared Earth, every man, woman and nation alike, must re-evaluate their priorities.
In the waning days of WWII, the Nazis of the nearly destroyed Third Reich flee to the far side of the Moon, in 1945. After more than seven long decades of thick mystery, the African-American astronaut, James Washington, lands on the Moon, only to unearth a well-hidden conspiracy and an entire colony of space-Aryans, led by the ailing Führer, Wolfgang Kortzfleisch. Now, hell-bent on returning to power, the super-race of Moon-Nazis seize the opportunity to invade the Earth with their formidable flotilla of spaceships and a mighty secret weapon. Once more, the world is at war. Is humankind prepared for the unwelcome arrival of the Fourth Reich?
