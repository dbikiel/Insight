Josh and Omar were the best of friends. Yet when they join rival dance crews, the bonds of friendship start breaking in their battle for redemption, identity and respect.
Capturing the raw power of a grassroots hip-hop movement, INSIDE THE CIRCLE tells the story of two strikingly talented b-boys, Josh and Omar, former best friends who become dance floor rivals. Immersed in the b-boy culture of defiant creativity, Omar rises to international renown, while Josh tangles with the law. Both of them struggle to keep dance at the center of their lives, and the "B-Boy City" competitive events thrown by visionary street dancer Romeo Navarro serve as emotional milestones in their journey to adulthood. Facing off in intense dance battles that mirror the larger events in their lives, Josh and Omar seek meaning and identity "inside the circle." As Romeo aptly observes: "If you can hold yourself down in battle, you can hold yourself down in life."
