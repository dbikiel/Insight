The magician Prospero attempts to stop his daughter's affair with an enemy.
An exiled magician finds an opportunity for revenge against his enemies muted when his daughter and the son of his chief enemy fall in love in this uniquely structured retelling of the 'The Tempest'.
The Tempest played out in dance and words; all the dialog is spoken by Sir John throughout the film. The 'books' form the central plot, Prospero's magic depending on them.
