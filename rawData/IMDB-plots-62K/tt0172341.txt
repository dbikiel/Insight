A very quick gunman is on the run from a rancher and his men out to kill him for killing his son. The gunman gets mixed up with a former Confederate soldier who has knowledge of hidden gold. The only trouble is he is also pursued by Union soldiers. When they free a man with part of the map to the gold, they then are also pursued by Spanish soldiers. It all leads to a small Mexican town terrorized by soldiers and led a by a good priest who also has knowledge of the gold.
