An encounter of some very diverse people, whose lives are intertwined by a fateful incident a long time ago.
"Alles inklusive" (The whole shebang) is the story of an encounter of some very diverse people, whose lives are intertwined by a fateful incident a long time ago. A melancholic comedy about mothers and daughters, about love's ups and downs and the shortcomings of alternative and middle-class life concepts. It's about the absurdity of modern traveling and our everlasting longing for the south. Can you book happiness just like a holiday - all inclusive?
