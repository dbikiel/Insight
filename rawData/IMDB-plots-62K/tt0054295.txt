A motley crew of professional thieves plans the robbery of a Monte Carlo casino vault.
In Monte Carlo, Theo Wilkins (Edward G. Robinson) recruits his young protégé Paul Mason (Rod Steiger), just released from prison, to help him rob the famous casino of four million dollars. The plan is straightforward. On the night of the Governor's Ball, Theo will create a distraction in the casino by having one of the team collapse requiring urgent medical attention. During that time, Paul and another member of the crew will get the money from the vault. When the ambulance arrives, the money will leave with the sick man. The plan is a good one, but not everyone will survive the robbery, and no one will get rich from it.
A discredited professor and a sophisticated thief decide to join together and pick a team to pull off one last job, the casino vault in Monte Carlo.
