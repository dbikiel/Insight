Several Russian Pomorsk men who live by the White Sea have brought in their boats for the evening and are relaxing inside a fisherman's hut. One of them says "there has been so much untruth told about our region that it is time to set the record straight" and proceeds to tell a variety of outrageous tall tales (based on traditional folklore of the Russian north). As the evening gets later, the tales turn more serious.
