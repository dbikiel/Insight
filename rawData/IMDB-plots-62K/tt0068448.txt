James Robertson buys a painting depicting witches being burned at the stake, one of whom bears an uncanny resemblance to his wife, Chris. Chris, gradually taken over by the personality of the witch in the painting that she resembles, allies herself with two other reincarnated witches to plan James' death, as he proves to be a descendant of the man responsible for the witches' fate.
Twenty-seven year old, pre-Magnum, PI Tom Selleck (Jim Robertson) is an art historian who lives in a spooky house in Manila, The Philippines with young wife, Chris. He finds a painting of three Duarte Coven witches and a dog being burned at the stake circa 1592; Chris is a ringer for witch number two. All of the figures in the painting, (including Nicodemus, the dog) begin to fade; Jim runs to and fro to find answers. Jim beautifully proclaims himself a cat lover when Nicodemus attacks him once too often. When Jim sees another related work (where he is a ringer for the torturer, Sir Diego Roberson, should he be concerned when Chris stops wearing her crucifix?
