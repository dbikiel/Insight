A bank clerk ends up in a seemingly haunted house that is actually a thieves' hideout.
Buster is a bank clerk. Overturned glue gets everything, mostly the money, stuck to everything else. When robbers show up he can't "stick 'em up" because his hands are stuck in his pockets. The robbers' hideout is a haunted house designed to scare off police.
After making a mess with some extra-powerful glue and a heap of banknotes, Buster, the conscientious bank teller, gets wrongfully accused of being a robber. To flee from the police, he finds refuge in a creepy residence, unbeknownst to him, however, that this is the lair of a well-organised counterfeit ring that uses clever contraptions and spooky effects to trick everyone into believing that this is a haunted house. But, amid ghosts, goblins, thieves, and liars, will Buster ever manage to prove his innocence?
