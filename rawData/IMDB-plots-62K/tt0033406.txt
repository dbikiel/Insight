An atheist accidentally shoots his Baptist wife. She dies and goes to a crossroads, where the devil tries to lead her astray.
In the rural south of the United States, a godly young woman is accidently wounded by her unchurched husband. She succumbs to the injuries, whereupon a good angel bids her to journey with him to the Crossroads of Life. Before she can travel far, the devil lures her with the temptations of juke joints and the city. Can she regain the straight and narrow before it's too late? And what is to become of those she left behind?
Married for three months, Razz and Martha Ann Jackson are a poor, black couple living in the rural American south. They live among a community of devout black Christians, Martha Ann being among their legion. Razz vows to Martha Ann that he will find religion, but that has not yet been truly evident. On the Sunday that Martha Ann gets baptized, Razz, instead of going to support his wife, goes out hunting, his "prey" domestic hogs of neighboring farmers. Razz justifies his action in wanting to provide for his family. After Martha Ann returns from her baptism and Razz returns from his hunting, Razz accidentally shoots and critically wounds Martha Ann. Along with the community of Christians, Razz stands vigil over Martha Ann, praying for her life. Meanwhile, the spirit of Martha Ann has to navigate the path to the next life, what she deciding to do which may not only affect if she lives or dies, but whether her eternal soul ends up in heaven or hell, regardless of if her time is now or later.
