A young woman's penchant for sensational Gothic novels leads to misunderstandings in the matters of the heart.
When Catherine Morland is given the opportunity to stay with the childless Allen family in Bath, she is hoping for an adventure of the type she has been reading in novels. Soon introduced to society, she meets Isabella Thorpe and her brother John, a good friend of her own brother, James. She also meets Henry Tilney, a handsome young man from a good family and his sister, Eleanor. Invited to visit the Tilney estate, Northanger Abbey, she has thoughts of romance but soon learns that status, class and money are all equally important when it comes to matters of the heart.
Catherine Morland is taken to Bath, England by the wealthy Mr. and Mrs. Allen and introduces her to Georgian society. There she meets the social-climbing Isabella and John Thorpe, the handsome Henry Tilney and elegant Eleanor Tilney. After making an impression on Henry and Eleanor's father, the Tilneys invite her to their country mansion, Northanger Abbey. Catherine falls in love with Henry but realizes that love can be fickle and that money - and not just love - is an important consideration in the marriage business. The story is based on Jane Austen's novel of the same name, "Northanger Abbey."
