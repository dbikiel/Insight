Kaveh Nariman is a coroner in the medical examiner's office. One day at his work he meets a corpse which is very familiar to him.
The forensic pathologist Dr Nariman has a car accident with a motorcyclist and injures his 8-year-old son. He offers to take the child to a clinic nearby, but the father refuses his help and money. The next morning, in the hospital where he works, Dr Nariman finds out that the little boy has been brought for an autopsy after a suspicious death. Dr Nariman is facing a dilemma: is he responsible for the child's death due to the car accident or the child died of food poisoning according to other doctors' diagnosis?
