In a small European country, the king is scheduled to visit a small, quiet and "safe" village. It turns out that while the village may indeed be small, it's neither as quiet nor as safe as it's expected to be.
In 1920, in Central Europe, the tyrannical king of an Empire is visiting the small town of Waldheim. While a group of revolutionaries plot to kill the despotic king, his oppressive secret service, leaded by Avanti, and the police force, leaded by Police Chief Hunt, organize his reception. Svetlana Vargas, a member of a bourgeois family and abused by her employee Emile, is in charge to organize the attempt against the king.
