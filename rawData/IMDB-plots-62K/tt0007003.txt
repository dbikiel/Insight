Romantic complications ensue at a boarding house when a maid inherits a fortune.
Ambrose has a heart of gold and is as strong as an ox. His mother, who runs a boarding house, can see that her maid, Rosie Bloom, is smitten with Ambrose by the way she is always neglecting her work while staring longingly at Ambrose. Despite Ambrose not having asked Rosie to marry him, Ambrose's mother disapproves of a union between the two because she does not want Ambrose to marry beneath him. A telegram that Rosie receives changes Ambrose's mother's mind but it also brings to the surface Ambrose's feelings. Add to the mix a boarder who is in love with Rosie and a traveling female artist who wants Ambrose to model for her and it becomes unclear if any boy will get the girl of his dreams, and visa versa.
Ambrose is a large fellow, strong, with a heart of gold. His mom runs a boarding house, and Ambrose likes Rosie, his mom's helper. Mom has higher ambitions for Ambrose. When Rosie gets a telegram informing her that she's inherited the Cheeseless Mousetrap fortune, she becomes more desirable to Ambrose's mom and to a city slicker who boards there, but not to Ambrose: he doesn't want to be a gold digger. Then, while Ambrose is out plowing, a lady artist drives past and asks Ambrose to pose for her wearing a caveman costume. Rosie sees Ambrose and the artist, gets the wrong idea (as does the artist's husband), and accepts the offer of the oily-tongued rival. Is there any hope?
