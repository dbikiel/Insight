Following his father's death, Nikos leaves the provinces to work in Athens guarding his brutish uncle's dogs. Nikos finds the dynamic of his relationship with his uncle changing when his uncle's wife draws closer to him.
Spending his days indolently somewhere in the Greek province, devoid of dreams and ambitions, Nikos has embraced a life without future. Under those circumstances, soon after the death of his father, Alekos, his uncle, will urge him to leave the village's miserable life to settle in with him in Athens, offering food and shelter in return for an uninteresting, yet easy job. As a result, Nikos will find himself isolated in a remote and drab Athenian suburb without friends or interests, where the frail balance between his uncle, his lustful aunt and himself will be inevitably disrupted with unforeseen and dreadful consequences.
Niko is an ordinary guy without any ambitions. His father's sudden death brings back his uncle who proposes to live and work together with him and his wife in the suburbs of Athens. Niko accepts his uncle's offer which consists of protecting two purebred dogs from the hostile neighbours. Driven by envy, lust and anger, Niko merges into a vicious circle of perpetual antagonism, the struggle for power over others and discontent.
