The boy Vova Sidorov is the only child in a large family. From the very childhood, a whole crowd of relatives took care of him, and they performed any of his whims. It all began in the morning, when Vova had to give something, to take him somewhere, and so on. But the summons from the military commissariat turns everything upside down, and then Vova Sidorov goes to the Red Army with his numerous relatives.
