Caroll's stories are the stuff of legend. He has been a constant presence in our lives for over 40 years, his path weaving through American history like that of Forrest Gump. His time inside the Bird has taught him about the world and about himself.

And, as the yellow feathers give way to gray hair, it is the man, not the puppet, who will steal your heart.
