A chance encounter proves fateful for 2 robots mining on a desolate planet.
Somewhere in a far-off and barren planet, a small but industrious mining robot is looking for precious minerals, all alone with its helper. And then suddenly, in this seemingly desolate land, an unexpected encounter with a much larger mining excavator will give birth to a fruitful alliance. But the transparent and phosphorescent crystals are sparse, and sometimes, even an automaton could be tainted by greed.
