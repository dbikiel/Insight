François' mother, Mme Lepic, hates him and she nicknames him "Poil de Carotte" (Carrot hair). His father is more interested in politics and hunting that he is in him. In spite of the affection of his godfather and his friend Mathilde, whom he calls his "fiancée", young Poil de Carotte contemplates suicide. On a particularly difficult day, he attempts to hang himself. Mr. Lepic saves his life just in time and understands he is partly to blame for this. From this day on, they both unite against Mme Lepic's bad temper.
