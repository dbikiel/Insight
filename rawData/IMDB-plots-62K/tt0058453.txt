The sprightly young assistant of a Hollywood screenwriter helps him over his writer's block by acting out his fantasies of possible plots.
Hollywood producer Alexander Meyerheimer has hired drunken writer Richard Benson to write his latest movie. Benson has been holed up in a Paris apartment supposedly working on the script for months, but instead has spent the time living it up. Benson now has just two days to the deadline and thus hires a temporary secretary, Gabrielle Simpson, to help him complete it in time.
In Paris, the successful alcoholic forty-two years old screenplay writer Richard Benson has three days to write a script to his producer that has paid in advance. The typist Gabrielle Simpson arrives to his hotel to type the screenplay. Along the three days, she helps him to develop the story and they fall in love for each other.
