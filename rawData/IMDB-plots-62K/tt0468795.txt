A music group of girls need to learn to play a song before the school festival.
Girls are friends, girls are not friends, girls come and go, but the band plays on in this film about a high school quartet with only three days to find a stable line-up, choose songs, rehearse and climb the stage at the rock music show of their annual festival. A foreign exchange student as a singer, a sullen guitarist, a shy bassist and a tom girl are a soaking wet band in a high school auditorium.
The school Festival is about to begin and Kyoko (Aki Maeda), Kei (Yu Kashii), and Nozumi (Shiori Sekine) are looking for lead vocals after their band breaks up. Kei recruits Son (Du-na Bae), a Korean exchange student who is still learning Japanese. The girls choose perform three songs from The Blue Hearts, an 80s punk rock group. They choose, Linda, Linda, Linda, An Endless Song, and My Right Hand. They have several late night practice sessions while Son tries to perfect her Japanese and Kei struggles to play the guitar better. The girls each face typical high school drama. Kei has to ask an ex-boyfriend for help. Kyoko has a crush on Kazuya (Katsuya Kobayashi) and is excited when he asks for help at the crepe stand. Son is asked out by a Japanese student who tries to learn Korean to impress her. They each face different struggles while trying to master their songs for the school festival. They almost fail to arrive when they fall asleep practicing in Studio Q. On their race to get back to the school it begins to rain and they forget instruments, fall, and Kyoko almost fails to meet her crush to tell him how she feels. They finally arrive at the school festival just in time to deliver a good performance to the excited crowd.
