The Mystery Gang goes to Hawaii for the Big Kahuna of Hanahuna Surfing Contest. However, the gang and the locals find the island invaded by the vengeful Wiki Tiki spirit and his demons.
When Daphne is given the opportunity to design clothes for a company in Hawaii, the entire gang travels along with her. As they are leaving for their destination, a man warns them that there are evil spirits on the island, but the gang is doubtful. When they arrive in Hanahuna, they are excited to watch the Big Kahuna of Hanahuna Surfing Contest, which Manu (a local) had won previously. Because the Mayor of the area welcomed everyone including mainlanders to the Surfing Contest, the Wiki Tiki spirit was angered. The gang and everyone in the area are threatened by the demons of the evil Wiki Tiki who also have kidnapped Manu's beautiful girlfriend Snookie.
