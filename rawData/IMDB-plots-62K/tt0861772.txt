When a young female video editor loses her boyfriend in a car crash, she finds solace in watching video of him taken the night before he died. When he starts to communicate with her through that video, she must decide if he has broken through the barrier between this world and the next, or has she slipped off into madness.
When a video editor loses her boyfriend in a car accident and begins receiving communications from him through her computer, she begins to question whether he has transcended the barrier between life and death--or if her fragile psyche has finally cracked. Jennifer (Elisabeth Rohm) has lost her family, and she's been plagued by horrifying visions of her younger sister ever since. The night before Wade (Waylon Payne) died, Jennifer noticed a stalker shadowing her every move. Was Wade's fatal car crash really an accident, or is the truth far more ominous than Jennifer could ever suspect? As the investigation into Wade's death intensifies, his messages to Jennifer grow increasingly vivid, and the stalker's presence becomes more menacing. [D-Man2010]
