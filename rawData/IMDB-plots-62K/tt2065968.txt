As the village of Berk prepares for its winter holiday, the resident dragons all inexplicably fly away.
The Viking town of Berk, now enjoying its new alliance with the dragons, is preparing for its annual winter holiday of Snoggletog. However, that spirit is threatened when all the dragons, except Toothless who needs Hiccup to help him, suddenly fly away for some reason. While Astrid ineffectually tries to salvage the occasion, Hiccup decides to build Toothless a new prosthetic to allow him to fly independently, only to have the dragon take off as well. However, as the holiday approaches, Hiccup finds himself swept up to learn the dragons' secret the hard way and to find a solution to bring them home early.
It is the first winter holiday on the island of Berk since the war between dragons and vikings was ended by the heroic efforts of Hiccup and Toothless. The vikings are looking forward to enjoying a peaceful holiday for the first time ever, but the dragons inexplicably decide to fly away, causing everyone to panic. It's up to Hiccup to find the answer and to save the day once again.
