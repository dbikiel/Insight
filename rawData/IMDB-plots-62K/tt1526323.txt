A psychotic willing to sacrifice anything for friendship transforms himself for the sake of his best friend who's not really fond of him.
Ajay reflects on his friendship with Arya and recollects how he met him during their stay in an orphanage. Arya virtually forced himself upon him, even tattooed his name on his arm, and proclaimed to be his best friend - but ended up only embarrassing him. After Ajay gets adopted, he heaves a sigh of relief but Arya does re-enter his life as an adult when the former is the CEO of Aj's Electronics. Ajay offers him a job conditionally that he behaves himself, and the latter undergoes a transformation and everyone believes that he is 'Mr. Perfect'. Complications arise after Geetha Reddy joins the firm and Arya shows her his true unstable and unpredictable colors - compelling her to admit that she is in love with Ajay. While both friends bicker as to who should wed her - Geetha's influential father has other plans - for he plans to wed her with Subhash - by hook or by crook.
