Macho Aussie Mark Brandon 'Chopper' Read doesn't even want to control his violent mood, dreaming of becoming an 'admired' crime legend. A confusing flash back structure from a murder trial shows his fickle paranoia, jealousy and arrogance can bring him no booty. He's even too insignificant for major charges.
