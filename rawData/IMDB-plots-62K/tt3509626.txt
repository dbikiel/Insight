A well-to-do Sydney party disintegrates into chaos and panic when a bomb goes off forcing 5 friends into a 1960's nuclear shelter. As food and water runs out they are forced to make an impossible decision - either one dies or they all die.
Things are afoot Internationally - Chinese conversations are overheard by US intelligence - rumours abound that something is about to happen... Oblivious to the potential threat everything carries on a normal in the thirty something world of well to do Sydney. Are those bush fires in the distance? The phone call received by Nick suggests they are more than that... His Plan A goes into action - do what you have to do to survive - and help the woman you love - - who caries this and one other secret from her husband... An explosion; a cloud; panic; fear; survival. 5 head to a 1960's nuclear shelter underneath the block they live in - a shelter designed for 2 adults and two kids - for fourteen days - but with "Agent Four" reported they are going to be trapped for much longer... As food and water begins to run out it becomes increasingly clear problems are heading their way - with the biological and nuclear agents outside reinforcing they are trapped - and forced to make an impossible decision - either one dies or the whole group dies... How do they determine who sacrifices themselves; who lives and who dies? Why did Nick have blood on his shirt when he arrived in the Shelter and will Anthony find out the two darkest secrets held by Michelle, his wife - and as the clock ticks away how do they determine their individual fate and that of the group ? Described by critics as "gripping" "suspenseful" "Indie Film at its best" be careful the story draws you in, twist and turns and keeps you on your toes all the way to the brutal end.
