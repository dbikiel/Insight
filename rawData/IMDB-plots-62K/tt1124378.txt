A series of horrifying events plague a Korean hospital in the 1940s.
Browsing an old photo book in 1979, Park Jeong-nam travels back with his memories to 1942, when Korea was occupied by Japan, when he was a young and immature intern doctor in Anseong Hospital. During those four days, strange events will happen, when corpses brought to the mortuary aren't able to rest in piece.Three intertwined stories follow, starting in reverse order (the second starts the day before):One: While awaiting for his bride-to-be to arrive from Japan (the daughter of the hospital's director), Jeong-nam is fascinated by a recently diseased young woman. He spends time near the corpse in the morgue and draws her face. It's then time for the diseased to return his appreciation.Two: Asako is a young girl who was the only survivor of a car accident which killed all her family. She doesn't speak and apparents to be in a state of shock, but what the doctors can't see is that she's drowning in guilt and being visited by the ghost of her mother.Three: Serial killings of Japanese soldiers continue and a married couple, Kim Dong-won and Kim In-yeong, both surgeons, are involved in the autopsies. Meanwhile, Dong-won finds out that his wife has no shadow, and that the killer is much nearer than he could possibly imagine.
