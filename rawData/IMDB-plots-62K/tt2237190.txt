Maybe clouds will start dancing out of a sudden. And a cricket will start chirping on its fiddle. With a small blue stream begins a river, and a friendship begins with a smile.
Little Raccoon has a birthday today and in order to check how big he already is, his mother sends him alone to the pond for sweet sedge for dinner. On the way, our little hero meets a monkey, which warns him of danger. She says that someone terrible is sitting in the pond, but our very big Little Raccoon is not afraid of anyone and therefore boldly strides toward the dangers. In the pond, someone who really frightened him, waited for him, but Mom's advice helped Little Raccoon to become friends with him.
