They were 12 saboteurs. The Nazis killed 11 of them. This is the true story of the one who got away...
True World War II story about Jan Baalsruds, one of the 12 saboteurs sent in 1943 from England to the Nazi occupied Northern Norway. After their boat is sunk by the Germans, Jan goes on the run towards the neutral Sweden. However, the brutal weather conditions turn out to possibly be an even greater foe than the Nazi patrols.
Fact is stranger than fiction in this WW2 drama. The bravery of the main character is perhaps only overshadowed by the bravery of those helping him escape the Nazis hunting him. The scenery is breathtaking and you can feel the cold which is the greater enemy in this tale of survival against innumerable odds. A lesson in the goodness of human nature.
