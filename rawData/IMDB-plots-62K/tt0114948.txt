A young man in high school moves with his mother to a town in the U.S. Southwest where his father is serving time in a penitentiary. There, he is discriminated against by his peers because he is the son of a convict; this discrimination includes the football coach keeping him on the bench. He receives special training from the ghost of Jim Thorpe, a Native American football star.
