A sheep dances proudly in his southwestern landscape, until one day his wool is sheared and he is left naked. He's depressed and shy, until a cheerful jackalope comes along and shows him how to leap proudly and not to be ashamed.
In the not too distant past, a lamb lives in the desert plateau just below the snow line. He is proud of how bright and shiny his coat of wool is, so much so that it makes him want to dance, which in turn makes all the other creatures around him also want to dance. His life changes when one spring day he is captured, his wool shorn, and thrown back out onto the plateau all naked and pink. But a bounding jackalope who wanders by makes the lamb look at life a little differently in seeing that there is always something exciting in life to bound about.
Not too long ago, there was a sheep who proudly danced in his lush wool until he had his first sheering which left him humiliated. However, in his despair, a jackalope passes by and shows the forlornly shorn sheep he can still dance even his present state to maintain his own sense of self worth during difficult times.
