A rebellious teen butts heads with the teachers at an all-girl charm school in Mexico City.
The ultimate rebel Adela boasts three tattoos, a body piercing and a recent arrest for alleged indecent behavior. Petrified that his beloved daughter will spoil his chances of becoming the next governor of Mexico City, Adela's father has enrolled her in the only remaining charm school for young ladies in the city. Maca Ribera guarantees that her school can turn any young girl into a "domestic goddess" ... that is until she meets Adela. The two determined women face-off in a battle of wills that turns the school and its colorful bunch of school-mates upside down when Maca attempts to transform the irreverent Adela into a suitable First Daughter.
