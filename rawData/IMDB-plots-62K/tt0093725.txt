Perry's publisher friend Jordan White is called to a hotel that famous horror writer David Hall has cleared out for a weekend and called his "friends"--his private assistant, an actress, a fortune-teller, and the two remaining hotel staffers, to discuss business. All of them want to sue David over his new book "The Resort," whose characters are obviously based on Jordan and the guests. Practical-joker David plays tricks on them until he's thrown from the hotel's high tower. Susan Warrenfield, owner and manager of the hotel, witnesses the fall and sees Jordan at the tower, and Jordan is arrested. While Perry and Della try to solve the main mystery, Paul tries to learn who's trying to scare Susan away from her hotel: a ghost, or a more earthly visitor?
