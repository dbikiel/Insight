Sotiris is a police interrogator. One day he decides to pardon every poor person to whom life has been cruel. Intending to save an innocent soul, he goes as far as to commit a crime. Dora, a lonely cleaning lady who leads a breathless life trying to make ends meet, is the only witness to the crime. Although Sotiris and Dora like each other, love, honesty and justice are anything but easy to combine.
