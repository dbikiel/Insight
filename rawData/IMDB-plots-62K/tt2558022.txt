In the picturesque Bavarian town of Oberammergau, two friends, Markus and Thomas, are using the instructions found in an old Jewish diary to gain access to a WW II underground military base formerly codenamed: CERUSIT. Used by the Nazis as a secret research institute, there are shrouded rumors to this day about the lost gold of the Third Reich. The entrance to the cave system, however, lies right within the restricted area of a U.S. military base.. the first of many problems Markus and Thomas will have to face. Equipped only with a two-way-radio and a 3D camera, Markus penetrates the restricted area and manages to locate the entrance to the underground facility and later, the secret base. But what Markus does not know is that through his efforts, he has not only drawn the attention of the US Military.. but something else that has managed to survive in exile for over 70 years without luxuries... especially food. For Markus, it has now become race of life and death.
