Technology brings us closer. Or perhaps it brings strangers, a little too close. But how much can you really trust someone? With a new ride share service, you never know who you'll be getting in a car with. Or if you'll ever get out.
A new ride share service app called RYDE is taking over what used to be the Taxi industry. It's cheaper and has more of a "friend giving you a ride" type of feel. With so many people using this fun new platform, how safe is it? When a PSYCHOPATH takes over the identity of a Ryde driver, everyone who uses this app will be at the mercy of this maniac. Getting a RYDE is as simple as a few clicks away, but getting out alive won't be so easy.
