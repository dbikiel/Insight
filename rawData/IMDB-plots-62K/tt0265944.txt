Based on actual accounts, The Untold is the story of Harlan Knowles, billionaire and President of Bio-Comp Industries who heads up a team of experts in a quest to locate a company plane that disappeared over the remote forests of the Pacific Northwest. Knowles is obsessed with finding the plane and rescuing his daughter, who was one of its passengers. The assembled team includes local guide Clayton Tyne, renowned wilderness expert and author Winston Burg and the beautiful Marla Lawson. Soon, the team begins to suspect that Knowles' main objective is actually to recover the prototype of a DNA testing machine called the Huxley Project, which his company has spent years and millions of dollars developing. After finding the plane and its crew torn to shreds, the group tries to piece together clues about what could be responsible for the carnage. With the help of the Huxley prototype they discover they are facing a menace whose very existence is one of the world's greatest mysteries and the only people left to rescue may be themselves.
When a team of experts is called upon to locate a missing company plane for the billionaire CEO of Bio-Comp Industries, they had no idea of the carnage waiting for them. After happening upon the gruesome fate of their predecessors -- the first team, along with their plane, had been mysteriously torn to shreds -- the second group realize they're facing an ancient enemy. Though the existence of a strange, bi-pedal man-beast popularly referred to as Sasquatch seemed little more than myth, the crew is forced to put aside their skepticism and focus on getting out alive. Sasquatch features Russell Ferrier, Lance Henriksen, and Andrea Roth.
