A mysterious person calls a young man and informs him that his estranged father has died in a country village. The curious son travels to the town to discover what happened. From there out the audience is led on a thrilling and hauntingly atmospheric journey into the history of the father and the truth about his relationship to the threatening and violent locals.

Let yourself be carried away...
While sick and tired of living in the city, Hae-guk (PARK Hae-il) hears that his father, YOO Mok-hyung (HUH Jun-ho), whom he hadn't spoken to for over 20 years, had passed away. But when he goes to the village where his father had lived, the village folks strangely keep their guards up and seem quite uncomfortable around him. Hae-guk is invited to dinner by some village folks after his father's funeral. It seems the people are set on rushing him out of their village. Regardless, Hae-guk announces he won't be leaving for Seoul, but stay in the village. The people exchange mysterious looks. Then, the Chief (JUNG Jae-young) accepts and tells Hae-guk to settle down in the village. On Chief CHUN Yong-duk's orders, the village people suddenly start acting differently around Hae-guk. The Chief looks like a normal elderly man at a glance, but he is frighteningly charismatic, seems all knowing, and the village people appear to be following him like a god. Meanwhile, Hae-guk gets all the more suspicious of everyone in the village...
