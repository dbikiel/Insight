A period drama/thriller about a surveyor and his fianc√©e who arrive in a remote Malaysian trading post and encounter a closed-fisted ivory trader and her ill-meaning family.
In 1924, Sarah and Hamish travel from England deep in to the jungle to earn their fortune surveying an ivory trading post. Instead of an exotic retreat, the couple encounters an oppressively small community. Despite their best intentions, their presence in the jungle unleashes a downward spiral that ends in greed, murder and madness.
