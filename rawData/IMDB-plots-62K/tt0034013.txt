Kildare saves the life of an ice skater who was in an auto accident. But even though her broken leg has knit, she can't walk, and she tries to sue Kildare for malpractice, and Kildare's entire career and reputation now rests on making a proper diagnosis in the courtroom.
Dr. Kildare finds himself being sued after a professional ice skater, Frances Marlow, loses the use of her right leg. Marlowe is a professional ice skater who had just signed a contract with the Ice Capades. She was on her way to New York for publicity photos when the car she was driving is hit by a truck at an intersection. Kildate and Nurse Mary Lamont were driving by at the time and he decides he has to operate immediately. Marlow's leg was badly broken but Kildare is certain he did nothing wrong from a medical point of view. Things are looking grim in court until Kildare and Dr. Gillespie diagnose the possibility of a rare spinal disorder.
