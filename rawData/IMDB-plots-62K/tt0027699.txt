Greedy Humpty Dumpty's wall of gold is not enough. He wants all the gold in the sun, too.
King Humpty Dumpty has a huge amount of gold, but wants more. He sees the sun, and thinks it is full of gold, so he orders his subjects (the various Mother Goose characters) to build his golden wall higher. They comply, and he reaches the sun, but when he does, the sun sends lightning bolts after him, which topple the wall.
Greedy Humpty Dumpty sits on his wall of gold, gloating over his extraordinary wealth. But all the gold in the world is not enough. He wants the gold in the sun, too. Little Bo Peep, Little Boy Blue, Mother Goose and the Old Woman who Lives in the Shoe all warn him not to be greedy. But he demands his subjects build him a wall of gold that will reach the sun.
