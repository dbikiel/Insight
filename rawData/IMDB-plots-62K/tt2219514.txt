When the older sister of Shira, an 18-year-old Hasidic Israeli, dies suddenly in childbirth, Shira must decide if she can and should marry her widowed brother-in-law, which also generates tensions within her extended family.
A devout 18-year-old Israeli is pressured to marry the husband of her late sister. Declaring her independence is not an option in Tel Aviv's ultra-Orthodox Hasidic community, where religious law, tradition and the rabbi's word are absolute.
Shira, an 18-year-old Hasidic Israeli, is considering a marriage offer arranged through a matchmaker, which is customary in her community. When her older sister unexpectedly dies, leaving a new-born baby, it is expected that Shira's brother-in-law Yochai will seek a new wife. Family tensions emerge over Yochai's possible choices. Both Yochai and Shira are urged to marry by Shira's mother, though both are hesitant despite their mutual attraction. Ultimately, Shira has to examine her own complex feelings in order to come to a decision.
