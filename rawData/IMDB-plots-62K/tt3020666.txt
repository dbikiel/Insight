Sixteen mustangs, four men, one dream: to ride border to border, Mexico to Canada, up the spine of the American West. The documentary tracks four fresh-out-of-college buddies as they take on wild mustangs to be their trusted mounts, and set out on the adventure of a lifetime. Their wildness of spirit, in both man and horse, is quickly dwarfed by the wilderness they must navigate: a 3000-mile gauntlet that is equally indescribable and unforgiving.
The four adventurous Texas A&amp;M graduates challenge themselves against weather, terrain and personal conflicts through a 3000 mile epic journey from Mexico to Canada with 16 mustangs from the BLM adoption program. After a period of training, the horses demonstrate their superior endurance to other domesticated breeds of horses.
This film illustrates the challenges of managing 'mustang' population throughout the western states. The Bureau of Land Management attempts to balance the expanding horse population with the seasonal free range grazing of cattle by ranchers, as well as animal advocates.
