Rose, 16, is a young girl from the DDASS. With his fiancee Michel, 22, they live their first big and innocent love story in Paris in 1979, at the heart of the Palace years. They are part of the hipsters band, who lives only for party and exuberance. At a party, they meet Lucille and Hubert, a bohemian bourgeois couple of about fifty, who will take them under their wing and shake their lives.
