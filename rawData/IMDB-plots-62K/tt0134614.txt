Several romance stories - part funny, part sadly - set in a remote logging camp.
Tonya has just graduated from the trade school and found a job as a cook in a Siberian village. She is naive but open hearted and kind. When Ilya starts flirting with her she takes it as a true romance only to discover that Ilya had a bet with his friends to seduce her. She stops talking with him but Ilya has already fallen in love with her.
Boy GETS girl.
BOY loses girl.
GIRL gets boy!
