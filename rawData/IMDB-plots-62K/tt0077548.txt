A communist journalist and an American liberal photographer try to cohabit with their different perspective of love and life.
Candice Bergen and Giancarlo Giannini star as two people from very different worlds who fall in love in A Night Full of Rain. When romantic Italian journalist Paolo (Giannini) rescues American photographer Lizzy (Bergen) from a scuffle in an Italian village, his efforts at romance lead nowhere. But when the couple meet again in San Francisco, Paolo does succeed in wooing Lizzy. Now, can their love overcome the differences between the traditional Italian Communist and the modern, liberated American woman that threaten to tear the two apart?
