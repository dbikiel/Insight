Cassie looks for a lost/stolen precious family memento.
Cassie Nightingale is given little time to plan her stepson Brandon's wedding to Tara. In addition, Martha, Middleton's new mayor, wants Cassie to head a silent auction fundraiser for the Middleton Botanical Gardens. When Audrey arrives in town looking for a job, Cassie hires her to work in her store, Bell, Book &amp; Candle. Audrey even offers to help with the auction. However, Cassie becomes suspicious when items for the auction go missing. She must use her powers, and the help of Martha and husband/police chief Jake, to uncover the truth.
Brandon and his beloved Tara decide to hold a Middleton wedding within weeks, before she must move for a job. Cassie coordinates the preparations, now Martha has succeeded as mayor, relying heavily on new ship assistant Audrey, whose ex-con ex Grant has his own agenda. Cassie's shop must also help collect items for an auction to finance the town's latest project, a botanical garden which will also be the wedding venue, but Jacks is officially charged with a police inquest for the disappearance of precious items. The shy, competent new school paper editor Jim pays a high price to date Lori.
