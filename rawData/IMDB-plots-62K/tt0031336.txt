And Ann, after the suicide death of her husband Mickey Borden who she married as his possible salvation, and Felix are once again engaged, he who she always truly loved. But the memory of Mickey, who was an acquaintance of Felix's, may be a major roadblock on the road to happiness for Ann and Felix, especially as Mickey leaves something a little unexpected of himself that may always be that constant reminder.
