In 1971 three inept petty Romanian criminals are released from prison but find themselves at the core of two money laundering and burglary cases.
During the 1970s Romania three petty inept criminals are released from jail. Upon their release from jail the three friends, Gogu, Trandafir and Patraulea vow to become law-abiding citizens and to seek jobs. They also consider their top-priority to find wives and get married. At the same time a local team of cops led by Major Dobrescu and Captain Panait investigate a case of money counterfeiting. The three paroled cons accidentally get hold of and use some of the counterfeit bills without knowing that the money is fake. The investigating police team suspects that these three paroled ex-cons are somehow involved. To make matters worse the three young pretty girls that our three friends have recently met and have been dating are, in fact, three con women. The girls belong to a burglary gang and they pose as available single women in order to find rich naive men who could be potential burglary victims. Therefore, Gogu, Trandafir and Patraulea unwittingly are walking into two traps at the same time.
