A woman in an unhappy relationship takes refuge with a friend's family on holiday in Tuscany.
During a sticky patch in her marriage forty-something Anna spends a summer holiday with her friends Verena and George at their Tuscan villa but hangs out with the couple's teen-aged children and their cousin Oakley, with whom she goes skinny-dipping and sight-seeing. When the youngsters prang a borrowed car and Anna tells George how it happened, causing a huge scene with his elder son, the kids turn against her. Observing family life as an outsider - unrelated - Anna ultimately comes to be grateful for what she has got.
A group of Britons are vacationing together in Italy, they having rented a Tuscan country villa. The group is split into two generations, the middle aged and their young adult offspring. Beyond the trip organizer Verena, her husband Charlie and their three offspring Jack, Badge and Archie, the invitees are Verena's cousin George and his son Oakley, and Verena's friend Anna and Anna's husband Alex, the latter pair who have no offspring. At the last minute, Alex doesn't go on the vacation. Although Anna states that Alex's no show is due to a last minute work commitment, Verena suspects that some sort of marital strife is happening between the two, which is the truth. Verena doesn't know for sure as she and Anna have drifted apart, Anna who has not confided in her anything about her recent life. Although being friends with Verena, Anna gravitates toward the goings-on of the four younger people, especially Oakley to who she is attracted. Oakley in turn quietly leads her on. Anna's mood and her behavior on the vacation is largely a manifestation of some news she recently received, which may have either been the impetus for or exacerbated the issues existing between her and Alex.
