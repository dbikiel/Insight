Gavin is thirty-one-years-old and still lives with his parents. He is awfully shy, but before he knows it, there are three women interested in him. Lady Minerva Munday has a casual way of life and lives in a basement, Joan is an over-sexed millionairess, married to a Greek architect. But Gavin prefers the ugly assistant in the barbershop.
