A town is taken over by a brutal gang, which has taken a safe in a robbery of another town and needs to find someone who can open it for them. They terrorize the townsfolk, beating up and even killing some of them, until several young men who know martial arts decide to stand up to the criminals
The heroes are savage because the villains are brutal, cruel, and vicious. At first, a gang just wants the village locksmith to open a stolen safe, but it soon escalates nto wholesale torment. The result is an especially realistic, even grueling, exercise in suspense.
