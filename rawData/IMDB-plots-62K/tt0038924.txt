One dark summer night, Francesca Cunningham, a once world famed pianist, escapes from her hospital room and tries to commit suicide by jumping off a local bridge. She is rescued and taken back to the hospital and undergoes psychological treatment by Dr. Larsen. Larsen, desperately wants to know the events and persons who drove her to this state and help her. He makes Francesca talk about her past - a past with a controlling guardian, Nicholas, no friends, kept apart from the man she loved and forced to practice the piano 5-6 hours a day.
After attempting suicide, Francesca Cunningham hires Dr. Larsen who, using hypnotism, delves into her subconscious in search of answers. Francesca recounts several failed romances to Dr. Larsen, shown in flashbacks, many of which were sabotaged by her cousin and musical tutor, Nicholas, a jealous taskmaster who cares for Francesca deeply. As the subsequent veils are lifted from her clouded mind, Francesca is forced to confront her feelings for Nicholas.
