A doctor and his girlfriend are stalked by a woman who claims to be in love with him. Meanwhile, the man falls in love with a younger woman. Based on a true story.
Hospital psychiatrist Jan Falkowski is engaged to Debbie Pemberton. After they are plagued by a series of silent phone calls someone enters Jan's houseboat and turns on all the gas taps. Over the months the couple are bombarded with warped text messages,expressing desire for Jan and threatening Debbie with the stark 'U Be Dead' and similar death threats.The stalker even cancels their wedding by phone as well as ringing their families. The police trace the caller,Maria Marchese,an Argentinian shop worker whose ex-boyfriend was a patient of Jan but she denies everything and the Crown Prosecution Service feel there is insufficient evidence to try her. By now Jan has left Debbie for the younger Bethan but his ordeal intensifies as he is arrested on charges of doping and raping Maria,for which he stands trial. She even has him suspended from work,sending him the triumphant text 'Got U'. But has she got him? Or,at his trial,will her lies be exposed and will she be the one who ends up behind bars?
