About a half dozen slacker dudes dwell at their jobs at Los Enchiladas, the local Mexican sit-down joint. The 2 folks in "management" are both into their own authority and fill their days creating wild &amp; stupid rules for the working folk. By mid-film, however, the manager has fled the cops after beating the crap out of a competing restaurant's dancing gyro... and the "Chef" has jumped ship to join a beatnik poet's groups which specializes in exotic menu-writing. This leaves the minimum-wage crowd to run the place as they see fit.... and they see a lot of debauchery, booze, and free steak in their future.
The film title refers to the name of a small Mexican restaurant located in Minneapolis. A drifter currently working as the cook suddenly finds himself in charge after the manager attacks a customer and the chef leaves for greener pastures. Basically, this is an ensemble comedy that looks at the interaction of its characters.
