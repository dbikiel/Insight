JJ/Qi Shu and PI Lam (Dong jing gong l√ºe (2000)) steal 2 stolen USD100 plates in HK. Lam loses them - no US reward. Lam and his 3 cute angels try to get them again in Seoul as does JJ. Lots of fighting.
In this sequel to "Tokyo Raiders", wisecracking, kung-fu-fighting spy/private eye Lam jets off to Seoul, South Korea with a bevy of gorgeous assistants to pursue the thief of a valuable money-counterfeiting plate. Once again, sundry chases, brawls, and double-crosses ensue against a gorgeous jetsetting urban backdrop.
