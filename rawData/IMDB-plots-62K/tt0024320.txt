The famous Baron Munchausen dumps two dimwits in the African jungle. A rescue team mistakes one of them for the missing Baron, and returns them to the US, where they're greeted as heroes. While giving a speech at a college, the "Baron" falls for a pretty girl, gets tangled up with a trio of nutty janitors and faces being exposed as a phony.
