Somewhere in the world right now--much closer than you think--people are playing with trains. You might not see them at first, but they're there. In basements. In garages. In converted Army barracks. They're among the world's most compelling underground communities. To the outside world, model railroading may seem a strange obsession. But who cares about the outside world when you can make your own world? Just ask a model railroader. Some say they're playing with trains. Others say they're staying engaged and staying alive. Either way, there's more to model railroading than meets the eye. Too many people grow up and grow out of what they loved as kids. Model railroaders are different. They're doing exactly what they want to do--and they don't need to explain themselves. But in Model Citizens, several do. Their stories and motivations may surprise you. You may even learn a thing or two. To all the free spirits out there . . . and the rest left grasping at freedom: The message is simple. Be yourself. Do your thing.
