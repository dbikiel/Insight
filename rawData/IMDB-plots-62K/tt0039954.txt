A drab woman scientist, working on machine to harness solar energy, and a pert concert singer look-alike being courted to play her in a movie swap identities and find personal growth, professional success, love, and happiness.
Director Arkadiy Gromov for his future film decides to get to know the life of scientists - as it seems to him at first, "hermits" who have renounced everything earthly - and for this purpose comes to the Institute of the Sun. Actress Vera Shatrova is similar, like a twin, to the prototype of her heroine, the Institute's scientist, Irina Nikitina (both roles are played by Lyubov Orlova). Vera Shatrova is going to play a role of scientist.
