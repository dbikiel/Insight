Each year, three brothers, Samuel, Jeffrey and Michael Douglas visit their grandfather, Mori Tanaka, for the summer. Mori is highly skilled in ninjutsu, and for years he has trained the boys in his techniques. After an organized crime ring proves to be too much for the F.B.I., it's time for the three ninja brothers! Using their martial artistry, they team up to battle the crime ring and outwit some very persistent kidnappers!
Meet Samuel, Jeffrey and Michael Douglas! Their grandfather, Mori Tanaka, is highly skilled in ninjutsu. For years he's been training these boys in this technique. He even gave them names: Rocky because he's "solid and cool as granite rock"; Colt, because he's "fast and free, a spirit of a young wild horse"; and Tum Tum because ambition begins and ends with his tummy". But one day, an old "friend" of Grandpa's, Hugo Snyder, is heard from again. He's being hassled by the F.B.I., and the boys' father happens to be an F.B.I. officer. So Snyder figures if he kidnaps the father's kids, it will ease the tension, none of his own men are suitable for the task, so he hires three dim and incredibly incompetent surfers to do the deed. The boys treat them to a night of ninja moves and hilarious gags ala 'Home Alone'. But the boys soon get captured by Snyder, and what is more, they become doubtful of their grandfather, until he bursts into action and fights Snyder.
Three young brothers, who have been trained in ninja techniques from an early age, learn that they possess powers which evil crooks would like to control. When a kidnap is attempted, they must defend themselves using all their skills.
