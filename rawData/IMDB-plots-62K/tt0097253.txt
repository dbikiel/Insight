During the Prohibition, Chicago mob send a hitman after a traitor. The only problem is that his traces lead to Odessa, and no one hitman can overcome the hardcore Soviet bureaucracy.
The Prohibition years. Chicago bootleggers suffer losses due to their betrayal by one Mick Nich - Mikita Nichiporuk. The mob decides to execute the traitor, who escaped to Odessa, USSR, and organized his own bootleg business there. The hitman, Pollack, arrives in Odessa, and realizes how hard it is to make the hit here, as compared to a civilized country like USA.
After Mick Nich, a 1930's Chicago gangster, sells out his own gang to the police, the Mafia hires the best hitman in town, Johnny Pollack, to follow him to Odessa, USSR. Upon arrival, Pollack loses his memory and goes on various adventures with a group of thick-headed Odessa locals who think he is a harmless butterfly collector. He subsequently regains and loses his memory several more times while trying to track down Mick Nich, who took it upon himself to create his very own alcohol smuggling syndicate filled with inept thugs.
