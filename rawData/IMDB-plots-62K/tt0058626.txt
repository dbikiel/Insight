A young girl travels to California with a couple of friends in order to visit her brother, whom she hasn't seen for some time. After they arrive it doesn't take long for them to get into the swing of things and also to attract the attention of the local police sergeant, who is strictly anti-surfing. Pretty soon there is a falling out between the local surfers and it becomes clear that her brothers reputation is far greater than reality and his lifestyle is not all it appears to be.
