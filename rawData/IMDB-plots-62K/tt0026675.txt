Mary, who is infatuated with her boss, discovers that he is having an affair with one of her coworkers. Despondent, she leaves work and overhearing news of a suicide, impulsively decides to drown herself in the river. She turns out to be an incompetent suicide, however, and while splashing about in the water, an apparently wealthy and dashing figure, Tony, drives up in his sports car and jumps in to save her. He takes her home to get her dry and to keep her from hurting herself--but his wealthy fiancee arrives and she assumes the worst and breaks off their engagement. Tony then reveals to Mary that he's broke, with only 300 pounds to his name. Now--each despondent--they both begin to talk of doing themselves in when tickets for Monte Carlo, which was to be his honeymoon destination, arrive. In a sudden bit of screwball inspiration, they decide to go to Monte Carlo and bet their little stake on an all or nothing bid to build a fortune for themselves. Its either win, or they both jump into the Mediterranean--a double suicide. Will fortune smile on this pair, or will it be into the drink for them?
