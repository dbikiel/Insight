With the guilt of a young man's death on their hands, three friends see their relationship disintegrate as each vies for survival by trying to kill one another.
In Rio de Janeiro, Gloria is an ambitious young woman, whose father is bankrupted. When the son of his business partner, Marcos, arrives in Rio, her father asks Gloria to have a trip with him in their boat Boa Vida. Gloria, her boyfriend Danny and their common friend Jeff get Marcos in his hotel and they go to Angra dos Reis. While in the sea, they drink Caipirinha and beer, and Gloria flirts with the wealthy Marcos. The jealous Danny sees they kissing each other, throws Marcos in the water with a lifebuoy and drives the boat to a distant island to scare Marcos. However, they have a problem with the propellers and when they return to the spot, they do not find Marcos anymore. Afraid of the consequences of his possible drowning, they discuss alibis and how to resolve the situation, shattering their relationship in an environment of high-tension and selfishness.
In Brazil, Gloria's father is bankrupt, so he asks her to take the son of his potential financial savior on a day of boating planned with her boyfriend Danny and their best friend Jeff. Marcos is the rich kid, muscular but, because of a childhood illness, not a swimmer. Gloria is a materialist and a flirt, happy to tease Danny with Jeff and then to toy with Marcos while the others dive. Danny gets mad at Marcos, though, and tosses him into the water with a lifebuoy, then drives the boat to the far side of an island. When they return, Marcos is missing in the strong currents, presumed drowned, and the three have to figure out what to do. Alliances shift, plots hatch, and Davy Jones beckons.
