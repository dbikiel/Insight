Banished from various U.S. protectorates in the Pacific, a saloon entertainer uses her femme-fatale charms to woo politicians, navy personnel, gangsters, riff-raff, judges and a ship's doctor in order to achieve her aims.
Bijou, a saloon singer with a reputation for inciting brouhahas, is one of several deportees from a south Pacific island to arrive at another U.S. protectorate, Boni Komba. She becomes very popular with U.S. navy men by performing at the 'Seven Sinners'. A navy Lieutenant is attracted to Bijou despite the Governor's machinations to keep them apart, and the competing affections of local mobster, Antro. Will the Lieutenant give up the navy for Bijou, and will he survive Antro's forces?
Cabaret singer Bijou, ejected from several Indian Ocean islands for inciting riots, lands on Boni Komba at the Seven Sinners Cafe. She's a big hit with the U.S. Navy, especially Lt. Dan Brent; but sinister Antro considers her his property. When Dan wants to marry her, both his career and his life may be in danger. All the villains wear white suits.
