Over the course of the last century, the US has silently encircled the world with a web of military bases unlike any other in history. No continent is spared.They have shaped the lives of millions, yet remain a mystery to most.
Today there are more than 766 US bases scattered around the globe, spanning across more than 100 countries and hosting more than 250.000 soldiers, in addition to the one million-plus soldiers stationed in the US. Acquiring military bases and new territories through acts of war is not something new in history, and the United States are no exception. Almost every single war waged by the US in the course of the 20th century has left behind a trail of new military bases, not only within the borders of the defeated countries. This ever-evolving history is the starting point for this documentary, which will attempt to reveal the mechanisms, purposes and hidden strategies of the bases, as well as the risks they pose for the countries that host them. A blend of stories, history and reflections. A journey across six countries and three continents: Asia, America and Europe.
