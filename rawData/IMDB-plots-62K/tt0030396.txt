When the murdered body discovered by beautiful, vivacious socialite Melsa Manton disappears, police and press label her a prankster until she proves them wrong.
Madcap debutante Melsa Manton finds a body in a deserted house. Of course, the police don't believe her. Stung by Peter Ames's front page editorial decrying her "prank," Melsa enlists seven fellow debs to help her investigate. The wisecracking young ladies proceed to run circles around the police, the suspects, and the press.
Madcap New York socialite Melsa Manton and her group of socialite friends are notorious as pranksters to the point of causing public mischief. Lieutenant Brent and his police officers think she's taken it too far when she reports having found a dead body in the empty house of wealthy Charles and Sheila Lane, with no body in sight when they arrive. Things get worse for Melsa when newspaper editor Peter Ames writes a scathing editorial about her scandalous behavior. The problem is is that Melsa really did see a dead body in the house, she going into the house only when she saw an acquaintance, Ronnie Beldon, mysteriously rush out of the empty house in the middle of the night. Melsa and her friends want to show Brent and Ames that she wasn't crying wolf by locating the dead body themselves. When both Charles Lane and Ronnie Beldon's dead bodies materialize - Lane's the one which Melsa originally saw in the house - Melsa and her friends believe she's been vindicated. But they continue to try and find out on their own who the killer is as Melsa is a suspect, they don't trust Brent's skills, and Melsa seems to be in danger for knowing too much. By this time, Ames also insinuates himself into the investigation as he has fallen in love with Melsa, who doesn't fully trust him as he may only be trying to get an exclusive story.
