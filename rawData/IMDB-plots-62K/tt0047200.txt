Don Gallico is a master at designing magical illusions which are sold by his employer, Mr. Ormond, to famous magicians such as Rinaldi. He is also a master of disguise and realistic mask design. When Don embarks upon his own career as Gallico the Great, showcasing his own masterful illusions, his dreams are shattered by Ormond and he turns to murder to vent his frustrations.
Don Gallico is a master at devising magicians' illusions and tries to establish his own stage show as Gallico the Great. His performance is interrupted mid-show by his employer Ross Ormond who has obtained a court injunction to stop him. Gallico had long ago signed an exclusive contract with Ormond to provide him with any illusions he might create. Gallico sets out to get his revenge against those who have wronged him, including Ormond, his ex-wife Claire, who happens to be Ormnond's wife and magician The Great Rinaldi who is Ormond's business partner and the main beneficiary or Gallico's new magic tricks. A clever young detective, Lt. Alan Bruce, uses a new identification technique, fingerprints, to identify the killer.
