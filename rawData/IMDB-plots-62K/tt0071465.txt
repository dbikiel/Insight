A young girl becomes possessed by a woman from a witches cult, who seeks vengeance, terror, and confusion around her family and the town folks.
An old witch seeks vengence through the daughter of the politician who had her thrown in jail. Soon the little girl's head is spinning around, and an old priest is called in to perform an exorcism.
