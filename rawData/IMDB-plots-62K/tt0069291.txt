When John Baxter inherits a ski resort in the Rocky Mountains, he quits his job in New York and moves the family west to run it. Only to find that the place is a wreck. But together they decide to try to fix it up and run it. But Martin Ridgeway, who wants the property, does everything he can to ensure it will fail.
Struggling emotionally and financially in a dead end job as an accounting clerk at a New York City insurance company, Johnny Baxter chucks the job and the New York life and uproots his family - wife Sue Baxter, and teenage children Chris and Richard Baxter all figuratively kicking and screaming - when he inherits what seems to be the lucrative twenty-five room Grand Imperial Hotel in the mountains in Silver Hill, Colorado. What they find upon arrival in Silver Hill in the middle of winter is a boarded up, dilapidated building that once made money during the mining era. What they also find is that they inherited, officially or unofficially, some of the town's misfits. Having spent all their money on legal fees and the move, they have no money to make even the most basic of repairs. But when Johnny learns that he not only owns the building but much of the adjacent mountainside, he believes the answer to their problems is to turn the hotel into a ski lodge, developing the mountain into a ski run. In the process, Johnny gets into one misadventure after another in having no experience whatsoever with winter alpine recreation. A further hurdle in achieving this goal is Martin Ridgeway, the local banker who tries to thwart Johnny at every turn in his goal to purchase the hotel himself. The unknown reason why Ridgeway wants the hotel so badly may truly be the answer to all Johnny's problems.
