The economic and cultural growth of Colorado spanning two centuries from the mid 1700s to the late 1970s.
This is the story of the evolution of the town Centennial, Colorado. It follows the paths of dozens of people who come to the area for many reasons: money, freedom, or crime. It also shows the bigoted treatment of the Native Indians by the advancing U.S. colonists. It is topped off with a murder mystery that takes one hundred years to solve.
