A kindhearted but bumbling idiot who likes to steal bananas, is passed off for a snitch hiding from the mob.
Good hearted but not very wordly-wise, Dante is happy driving the school bus for a group of mentally handicapped children, while feeling he is somehow missing out on life and love. So he is very excited when after nearly being knocked down by her car he meets Maria, who seems immediately enamoured of him. He is soon invited to her sumptuous Palermo villa, little suspecting that this is part of a plot. He bears an amazing likeness to Maria's stool-pigeon gangster husband and it would be convenient for them if the mobster, in the shape of Dante, was seen to be dead and buried.
Dante is the ultimate loser. Nothing seems to work for him - especially in love. Suddenly, a beautiful and rich woman gives him some hope. However, the deal involves Dante going to Sicily where the woman's husband is an infamous gangster known as Johnny the Toothpick ("stecchino" in Italian). Johnny has denounced some of the local mafiosi to the police so their friends want him dead. So, why not get Dante killed instead.
