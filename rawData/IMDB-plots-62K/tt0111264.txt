A sultry assassin is the target of two separate operatives in this globe-trotting action flick shot on location in the Bahamas, Athens, Rome and Hong Kong.
A pre-story sequence with Lance Henriksen as a super-spy and an opening credits obviously ripping off the James Bond themes gives hope for a spy story or spoof in the Bond mode. However, the story quickly opens with former USA gymnastics champion Kristie Phillips in the lead role as the spy's unknowing gymnast daughter who gets caught up in the spy's attempts to keep Ukranian missile launch codes from falling into the wrong hands. Sarah Douglas shows up as the Soviet spy trying to get the codes back and willing to kill anyone to get them including Phillips' Mother and brother. Tim Thomerson also appears as a journalist reporting on the gymnasts who gets caught up in the events.
