The story of Shell, a girl who lives with her father Pete in a remote gas station in the Scottish Highlands, in their struggle against the elements and the impossible love they feel during the last winter that she will be in that place. The Scottish Scott Graham in the feature film debut with an adaptation of his short Shell, winner of the London Short Film Festival. His next short film, Native Son, was released in the Critics' Week in Cannes in 2010.
Set in the remote and unforgiving Highlands of Scotland, the film centers on the titular 17-year old Shell, a young girl who lives an insular life with her quiet and epileptic father at their small garage-cum-petrol station. They eke out a lonely existence together expectantly waiting for the infrequent passing trade. Occasionally people will break through this suffocating relationship and provide a possible way out for Shell but she remains doggedly loyal to her father.
