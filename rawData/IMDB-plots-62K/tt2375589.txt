The scars of our youth shape the adults we become.
Seventeen year old Miklós Varga's plans to escape his migrant family and run away with his best friend Dan are crushed by the accidental death of his older brother Tomi. Only Mik knows the events that led to this tragedy, and he is suddenly forced to navigate his guilt and explosive sexuality to find the man he can become.
Miklós is at the age when everything feels high-stakes. He is coming to terms with his own sexuality, and when his best friend Dan reveals that he has a new girlfriend, this puts an end to their plans to run away together. He is torn between loyalty to his migrant family and his own desires, and his world is soon rocked by the death of his brother Tomi, that he feels partly responsible for. Teenage Kicks beautifully captures this whirlwind period in Miklós' life, dealing with themes of guilt, friendship, cultural and familial loyalty, and burgeoning sexuality.
