The untold story of big-wave surfing in Ireland.
WAVERIDERS tracks the previously untold story of surfing pioneers all linked to Ireland and incorporates an unexpected twist that spins the story across the globe to Hawaii, California and back again.
WAVERIDERS is the critically-acclaimed story of Irelands roots in modern day surfing and its most surprising legacy the emergence of big wave surfing along its forbidding coastline. Paying homage to George Freeth, the father of modern surfing, the story follows the wave of surfing culture from west coast America to Irelands unforgiving waters. With stunning coastline, thumped year round by unmatched North Atlantic swells, Ireland is the pre-eminent destination for big-wave surfers. Featuring pro surfers Kelly Slater, Gabe Davies and the Malloy brothers, and narrated by actor Cillian Murphy, Waveriders culminates in aweinspiring and nail-biting footage of surfers conquering the largest waves ever surfed around Ireland.
