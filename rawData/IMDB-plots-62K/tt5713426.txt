An unexpected blizzard threatens the Parton family, while at the same time Dolly's father (and his kids) make sacrifices to raise enough money to finally buy his wife the wedding ring he could never afford to give her. Meanwhile, an important person in little Dolly's life begins to see that her amazing voice and musical gift might just be made for something bigger than rural Tennessee.
In 1955 east Tennessee, the Parton children make a momentous decision, to forego their "storebought" Christmas presents so that their father can afford to give their mother the wedding ring that she has always wanted. Unwilling to see his children face such deprivation, Robert Lee Parton takes a job in a coal mine several counties away so that he can make enough money to buy the ring, and still allow his children to have their desired gifts, but this takes him away from home just before the arrival of a snowstorm unlike any the area has ever seen before.
