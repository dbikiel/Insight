Kerem, who is now a young and extremely popular rock musician, grew up with his little sister, Buse, at his grandfather's farm after losing his parents. The grandpa, an extraordinary inventor, one day comes up with an elixir that enables humans to speak with animals and control their behavior. In order to prevent evil people from obtaining the formula, he keeps it a secret. However, Ã–kkes, a boy from the same village who has a crush on Buse, knows about the elixir.
