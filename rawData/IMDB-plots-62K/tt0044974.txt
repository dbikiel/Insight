Archaeological team unearths a body of a young woman, who was told to be a witch buried in the bog some 300 years ago. Soon a naked woman appears and drives the men of the village crazy. Everybody is certain that this really is the witch killed in days of yore. At the end the wild happenings during those few days appeared to be a dream of the professor leading the excavations.
