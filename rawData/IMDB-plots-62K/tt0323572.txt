The successful and handsome wolf executive of the cosmetic industry Thomas Fuentes has three sexy Latin girlfriends: in Miami, the waitress Cici; in Chicago, the intellectual lawyer Lorena; and in New York, the "daddy's girl" Patricia. When the three women decide to visit him in Los Angeles, Thomas is in a big trouble.
A comedy which revolves around three disparate women--a buttoned down lawyer from Chicago, a Miami cocktail waitress, and a wealthy, sheltered New Yorker--who discover they share something in common: a boyfriend from L.A. Unfortunately, they are all involved with the same irresistible, charming lothario who has been three-timing them across the country, with great expertise. They decide to teach their papi chulo a lesson, but instead end up on a wild adventure of their own, which takes them to a beauty pageant, a dance festival, and into some dangerous run-ins with a pair of shady characters.
