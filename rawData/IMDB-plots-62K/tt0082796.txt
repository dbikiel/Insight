An impoverished employee tries to prevent his superiors and employers from marrying his sweetheart.
The story revolves around an old man, chachaji in search of a home after his house is repossesed by the village money-lender, and his young daughter, Kusum. Ramprasad is a poor young man in the employ of Bhavani Shankar a superstitious, middle aged widower. Ramprasad succeeds in securing a victory for Bhavani Shankar in a long running court case, which gives back Bhavani Shankar's family the possession of an ancestral house. When Ramprasad is assigned the responsibility of getting the house back in shape so that it can be re-occupied, chachaji and Kusum arrive there. When this comes to the knowledge of the estate manager, Gajanan Babu, he arrives furious and determined to oust the usurpers. However, he succumbs to the charms of Kusum and instead of ousting the old man and his daughter, presents a proposal of marriage. Horrified, Kusum and Ramprasad turn to Babua for help. He, in turn, is captivated by Kusum's beauty and presses his suit. Then Ramprasad turns to Bhavani Shankar, but he, too, declares he wants to marry Kusum.
Uttar Pradesh-based Ram Prasad, who earns a meager wage of Rs.150/- per month from his miserly yet superstitious widower employer, Bhavani Shankar Bajpai, lives in a cowshed, is troubled when Kusum and her dad move in with him in his employer's country house. He permits them to reside there temporarily, and refuses to marry Kusum until he earns a decent wage and has better accommodation. His troubles will multiply tenfold when not only his supervisor, Gajanan, but his employer's rough-talking garage-owner brother, Kali Shankar, as well as his Bhavani himself approach Kusum's father for her hand in marriage.
