A chain-wallah from Delhi travels across India in search of his missing son, in the hopes that whoever took him, returns him unharmed.
After sending away his 12 year-old son Siddharth for work, Mahendra (a chain-wallah who specializes in fixing broken zippers on the streets) is relieved as his financial burdens will be alleviated. But when Siddharth fails to return home, Mahendra learns he may have been taken by child-traffickers. With little resources and no connections, he travels across India in pursuit, with the hope that whatever force arbitrarily took his child away will return him unharmed.
