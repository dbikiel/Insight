A construction worker destroys Bugs' home with a steam shovel and refuses to repair the damage.
It's morning and Bugs Bunny is awake. It doesn't look like he had enough rest though. He looks around and sees he is high up in the sky. Bugs' hole has become part of an construction site and a bulldozer is ready to move his hole to destruction. Bugs makes an emotional plea to move his home back to it's original place and the construction worker seems touched. But his intentions aren't that well. Bugs Bunny swears revenge.
