Twenty-eight-year-old Kansas University doctoral student Omar Razaghi (Omar Metwally) wins a grant to write a biography of Latin American writer Jules Gund. Omar must get through to three people who were close to Gund; his brother, widow, and younger mistress, so he can get authorization to write the biography.
