An egotistical boxer romances a rich backer's daughter.
Trainer Pop Hardy thinks his heavyweight boxer 'King' Cole could be champ...some day; he wants to sell a half interest in Cole to his rich friend Wayne. Wayne's daughter Eleanor is disdainful, but brash Cole manages to get under her skin. Can a society dame and a mug find happiness together? And can she wait for his slow rise to fame?
Rich girl Eleanor Wayne falls in love with prizefighter Al "King" Cole when Cole's manager appeals to her father for funds to advance Cole to championship level as a boxer. Despite the fact they come from different social strata, they are married and live happily for a short while. But their happiness is shattered because the only profession Cole knew is boxing and, to pursue it, he has to go on the road for long stretches of time. A son is born to the couple while Cole is away, and Eleanor is heartbroken that her husband (and new father) wasn't there, but she forgives him. A decade later the boy has grown up to hate his father because he knows his mother is lonely without him, and Elanor and Cole are divorced. From there the story concerns the efforts of Cole to win his son's love, and of Eleanor to help the man she still loves to find himself.
