In 2005, high-ranked criminal Bar√£o is planning the heist that inspired the film. He needs to dig a tunnel linking a house to the Banco Central's vault in Fortaleza, where he'll steal millions of (R$) reais.
"The Baron" wanted to commit the perfect heist involving 3 tons of money and no violence. For this he would need the right people willing to get R$ 2 million to take part in this job. Based on true events, in 2005, 168,000,000 Brazilian Real (almost 80,000,000 US dollars) were stolen from a Brazilian Central Bank (Federal Reserve), making it the biggest peace-time robbery in history. It was perhaps the most audacious bank heist ever.
