Lou spends her days eating takeout, playing with her cat and spying on a hunky neighbor, but when her mom falls in love, her life takes a sudden turn.
12 1/2 Lou lives alone with her absurdly immature mother, Emma. She spends her days playing with cat, eating at a italian restaurant, and spying on her dreamy neighbor Tristan, obsessively journaling his every move. But all this changes with arrival of the new bohemian neighbor, Richard, who ignites her goofy mother's romantic interest and triggers a series of increasingly embarrassing episodes.
