A handful of unforgettable characters set out on a 100-day quest to tame a totally wild mustang for a Texas competition in this stunning and poignant documentary. Among them: Charles, a Navajo grandfather out to re-capture his youth; George, a grizzled cowboy with a stubborn streak; and Wylene, a blond beauty with a theatrical flare and a nerve of steel. In three months, man and horse must transform from scared strangers to close companions. It won't be an easy journey. Bones and egos will take a beating. Fear and frustration will weed many out. But those who prevail may find themselves desperately vying to keep their horses when they ultimately all go up for adoption at a public auction.
100 Days. 100 gritty souls. 100 wild mustangs. That's the premise of the annual Extreme Mustang Makeover, a competition that challenges horse trainers - both pros and amateurs - to each tame a totally wild horse in order to get it adopted into a better life beyond U.S. Government corrals. Intimately following a handful of participants in the 2009 event from their first uneasy meeting with their horses and up through the competition and adoption, the film documents the deep and profound bonds that can develop between man and beast.
