A satirical fairy tale about an old tsar Dadon and a golden cockerel who guarded the borders of his kingdom.
A battle follows between the enemy soldiers and the warriors of Dodon. The day after the battle, the Tsar decided to call a council in order to decide what to do next. When he was ready to guess the stars, as if on call, a sage-astrologer appeared and presented Dodon with a golden rooster. If the country is calm, he will sit quietly, and in case of danger he will announce it.
