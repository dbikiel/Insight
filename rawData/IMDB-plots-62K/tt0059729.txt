Allan Newell is a Seattle university student who works at a phone-in crisis clinic. The calls he receives are for the most part routine - an unhappy barber who feels he gets no respect, for example - but he then gets a call from a suicidal woman, Inga,who claims to have already taken an overdose of barbiturates. Through flashbacks, we learn of the events that have led her to attempt to take her own life. Her husband learned that their child is not his and her marriage is on rocky ground.
