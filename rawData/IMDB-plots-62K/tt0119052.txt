Little Tree is an 8-year-old Cherokee boy, who, during the time of the depression, loses his parents and starts to live with his Indian grandma and grandpa and learn the wisdom of the Cherokee way of life.
Eight year old Little Tree lives in depression-era America. After his parents pass away, he goes to live with his grandparents in the rugged country side. There he is taught by them, as well as by Willow John, the Cherokee way of life. The history of how the Caucasians settlers first befriended them, then using the army forcibly took over their lands, forced them to re-locate resulting in many deaths. When the state's social services finds out that Little Tree is not attending school and is assisting his grandfather in selling liquor, they compel him to re-locate to an oppressive state run school, where things take a turn for the worse.
