An otherwise moral captain of a charter boat becomes financially strapped and is drawn into illegal activities in order to keep up payments on his boat.
Fishing boat captain Harry Morgan charters his boat. Due to strained finances, he is none too careful as to whom he does business with. Real trouble erupts when Harry hires out his boat to transport four men who turn out to be criminals on the lam from a racetrack heist.
In true Hollywood fashion, Warner Bros. bought the film rights to Hemingway's novel "To Have and Have Not," used the title for a follow-up to "Casablanca" with Humphrey Bogart, then filmed the plot as "The Breaking Point" with John Garfield. Bogart's fans probably would not have accepted him as Hemingway's anti-hero, which fit Garfield's persona perfectly.
