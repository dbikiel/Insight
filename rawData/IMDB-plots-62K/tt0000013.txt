From a boat descend the photographers who must partecipate in the congress of Lyone dividing in two diagonals to the right and left. After, someone greets the film operator.
Members of the French Photographic Society arrive from a riverboat to their congress venue in Neuville-sur-Sa√¥ne on a summer day. They go ashore across a wooden landing stage. Among the many men in straw hats are also a few women in long skirts. Some of the men lift their hats toward the photographer when passing. Many of them are carrying their own cameras.
Down the gangway, photographers leave the deck of a riverboat in large numbers. In the background, a bridge spans the river. The group is in Neuville for a congress. This film was shot in the morning. The "actors" were the film's audience that afternoon.
