Prince Leopold, heir to the throne of Cordinia, wishes to marry his young love Emily Taylor, a humble seamstress from Philadelphia. But Leopold's mother, Queen Isadora has other plans for her son.
Prince Leopold, heir of queen Isadora of Cordinia (a fictitious cheap Monaco version), enjoyed studying incognito in Philadelphia and shocks his mother by bringing home a lasting souvenir: Yankee seamstress and would be-designer Emily Taylor, to whom he proposed just before unveiling his royal identity. Isidora is hell-bent on chasing the commoner intruder and marrying Leo off to an eager, overconfident aristocratic youth friend, Natasha, Duchess of Warren. Leopold, the devoted palace butler Victor and his staff are rather pleased with Emily and her fast progress in society manners, but Isidora won't give up until she breaks Leopold's heart.
