A pompous, adventure-seeking businessman journeys through Africa with a clumsy employee to find his own disappeared brother-in-law.
A rich businessman is fed up with work, family, society, and goes with a friend to Africa, in search of another friend who had vanished there in mysterious circumstances. They will find him alright - as a tribal chief, surrounded with lots of topless, shapely wives. They are going to return to civilisation, but will their friend come with them ?
