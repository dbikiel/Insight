Passengers on a stranded bus in a desert are attacked by a vengeful winged witch.
Sameer hopes to drill a well using dynamite and boards a bus to go to his village in Rajasthan. There are 13 other people on the bus, including four men who are on their way to a wedding; gorgeous Rukmini and her husband, Nikhil; a sexy model, Shaz, and photographer, Hasmukh Shah; Pandit Ram Srivastav and his wife; a young girl, Shona, and the bus driver and conductor. Ram is fearful after the bus changes it's route to go through Kulbhata - a village that was abandoned overnight after a vengeful witch, Kaalo, re-surfaced after being killed 250 years ago. He is scoffed at, and the bus does take the detour. Shortly thereafter the passengers will be stranded after a flattened tire, and soon face the horror of a seemingly invincible winged Kaalo - who can not only travel under the sand but also fly - and who is determined to fulfill her deadly agenda at any and all costs.
