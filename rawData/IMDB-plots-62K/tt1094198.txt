King Edvard, to please Queen Paige, diverts their honeymoon to the fictional crown protectorate of Belavia. Soon they discover an underhanded plot by the ambitious Danish prime minister; hijinks abound, but Eddie, Paige, and Belavia win.
As King Edvard and Queen Paige prepare to leave Copenhagen on their honeymoon, Eddie, to please Paige, changes their destination from a Caribbean island to the fictional crown protectorate of Belavia; shortly after they arrive, a henchman (Oliver) for the ambitious Danish prime minister (Polonius) sees the couple, and Paige recognizes Scott, now a journalist, previously a high-school boyfriend. Soon the king and queen discover Oliver, machines, and a crew, about to start clearing a forest preserve to make way for an oil pipeline; the king orders them not to begin. The royal couple make progress with the prince of Belavia, but Polonius does his dirty tricks. Edvard and Paige learn that Scott has secretly taken part in the evil work of Polonius and Oliver. Many hijinks abound, but, predictably, good and right prevail, so Eddie and Paige win, as does Belavia. The Danish parliament follow the leadership of their king, thereby defeating Polonius.
