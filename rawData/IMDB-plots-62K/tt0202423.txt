An arrogant samurai murders a blind masseur, whose young daughter Rui is left an orphan. The masseur's corpse is hidden in the waters of the Kasane Swamp. His disfigured ghost haunts the samurai, tricking him into killing his wife, and luring him to drown in the swamp. The samurai's infant son, Shinkichi, is entrusted for his upbringing to another family. 20 years later, Shinkichi has become a servant in the family's gift store. Hisa, the family's daughter, is in love with him, but her mother insists she marry into wealth. Shinkichi is also desired by Hisa's samisen teacher, Rui, who doesn't know he's the son of her father's murderer. They become lovers, but their affair disintegrates after Rui is accidentally disfigured and starts to believe Shinkichi will leave her for Hisa. Omura, a samurai who previously tried to rape Rui, encourages her delusion. While attacking Hisa, Rui falls down some stairs and dies from her injuries. Shinkichi and Hisa begin the journey back to the village of their birth, passing through the Kasane Swamp. Rui's disfigured ghost tricks Shinkichi into killing Hisa. Omura, who has followed the couple into the swamp, kills Shinkichi, but is then himself taunted by Rui's ghost, but it's the spectre of the blind masseur who finally pulls the treacherous samurai beneath the swamp waters.
