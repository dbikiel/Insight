Someone I loved (Je L'Aimais) is based on the best-selling novel by Anna Gavalda. It's the story of Pierre (Daniel Auteuil), who takes his daughter-in-law, Chloe (Florence Loiret Caille) and two small granddaughters to the family chalet to stay following a family crisis. Pierre's son, Adrian, has abruptly dumped his wife and children, and Chloe who "never saw it coming" is so emotionally devastated, Pierre thinks it's wise to take her away somewhere quiet for a few days until she stabilizes.
