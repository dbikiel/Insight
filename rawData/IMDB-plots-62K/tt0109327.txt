A teenager is part of an interactive video game where he kills innocent victims. Later, the murders become real.
A lonely teenage horror-movie fan discovers a mysterious computer game that uses hypnosis to custom-tailor the game into the most terrifying experience imaginable. When he emerges from the hypnotic trance he is horrified to find evidence that the brutal murder depicted in the game actually happened -- and he's the killer.
Michael Bower (Edward Furlong), a high school student, with a passion for horror films, finds an advertisement for a newly released video game, titled "Brainscan". The creators say Brainscan "It is the most frightening experience you have ever displeasure of coming into contact with. It interfaces with your sub-conscience, you supply the information, and we take care of the rest." Michael receives the video game disc in the mail, the same day his dream-girl Kimberly (Amy Hargreaves) throws a party across the street. Once he starts to play the game, he will face several challenges that will be the ultimate test of his love for Kimberly and his sanity!
