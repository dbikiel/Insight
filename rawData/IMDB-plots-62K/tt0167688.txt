James is a lonely and miserable mime whose nihilistic performances are poorly received, attracting the ire of The Divinely Supreme Brotherhood of Mimes. His other career of crafting pet rocks and sea shell creatures isn't going any better, so he decides to join his good-looking and successful roommate Frank in leading a life of violent crime. Meanwhile, their landlord's mother prophesies the coming of a new messiah and James wonders if it could be him.
