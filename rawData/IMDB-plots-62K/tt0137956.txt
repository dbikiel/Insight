Tarmo, the young nephew of Uncle-Scrooge-like Consul Ö is after his uncle's fortunes. After investing in Tarmo's unfinished studies, the uncle is furious and threatens to leave Tarmo penniless unless he is able to raise one million marks in one month. If not, he'll donate everything to an antiquarian society. Helped by some magic pills given by his friend, Tarmo spends the month in and out of various money schemes. Among other things he tries making avant-garde films to please the awards jury, and spends holidays in Spain on behalf of his clients who are too busy to take time off themselves. A band of crooks in pinstripe suits watch Tarmo's every move, trying to eliminate him after hearing about his uncle's fortune.
