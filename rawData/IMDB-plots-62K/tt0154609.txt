"There are two roads: the wide one leads to perdition,the narrow one is not easy to follow,but it leads to happiness"
Maloin has been working all his life for 2,500 measly Francs a month.One day he finds a case full of money ,after watching a gangland killing."I 'd have to work a hundred years to make that!"he says.He could send his son to "Polytechnique" ,he could take his wife to the Riviera.He could escape from the third-rate position he holds in the harbor.He could leave behind his mean brother-in-law who's wearing suit and tie and is working in a bank (and thinks he's got it made).But Maloin has an uneasy conscience .His colleague always reads some pages of the good book before going to sleep.
