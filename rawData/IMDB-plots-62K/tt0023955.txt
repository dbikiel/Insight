Doc Bull, a no-nonsense country doctor who has served his community for decades, fights small-town prejudice and provincialism in several crises.
Dr. Bull is an old-fashioned country doctor whose affair with the widow Janet Cardmaker is creating waves in the small town where he practices. When there is a mysterious outbreak of typhoid which the doctor is slow in reacting to, it all comes to a head. The townspeople hold an emergency meeting and decide to give Dr. Bull the sack and bring in a new doctor. Dr. Bull must find a way to save his job, his reputation, and a young man's life, whom all other practitioners have written off as a permanent invalid.
An old-fashioned New England village doctor, George Bull, has seen the youth of the town from from babies through measles to marriage and more babies. He has developed a wise and unpretentious philosophy which he frequently illuminates, and has remained a bachelor. In a neighboring town, Doctor Verney, with the aid of the socially elite Herbanning and his wife, attempts to establish, in competition to Dr. Bull's old-fashioned methods, an impressive, bristling-with-gadgets medical practice. Banning's married daughter, May Typping, opposes his attempts to out Dr. Bull, and is aided by the widow of Bull's best friend for many years, Jane Cardmaker. Dr. Bull doesn't know just why he has never proposed to Jane, and his town enemies spread malicious gossip. After having pledge he would prevent such a thing, Banning's construction camp contaminates the water supply, and Dr. Bull works around the clock to combat the ensuing typhoid epidemic, and his efforts work, and also discredits both Banning and his protégé. Finally Dr. Bull wins world recognition with a new paralysis cure for May's husband and, after his marriage to Jane, returns to his good-natured, old-fashioned practice.
