Space Cop is a sci-fi schlock comedy about a cop from the future (of space) who travels to the present, where he's teamed up with a cryogenically frozen cop from the past who has been thawed out in the present. Out of time and out of place, these two unwitting heroes must work together to save the world from a group of renegade aliens and the re-animated brain of a mad scientist bent on global extinction.
