Seven portraits of different types of women.
Seven mini-stories of adultery: "Funeral Possession", a wayward widow at her husband's funeral; "Amateur Night", angry wife becomes a streetwalker out of revenge; "Two Against One", seemingly prudish girl turns out otherwise; "Super Simone", wife vainly attempts to divert her over-engrossed writer husband; "At the Opera", a battle over a supposedly exclusive dress; "Suicides", a death pact; and "Snow", would-be suitor is actually a private detective hired by jealous husband.
