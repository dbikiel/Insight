The newspaper of the family of the photographer Charly sponsors an expedition to the Arctic in the ship Polar Queen to find and rescue Bowen Tyler. Soon the rescue team formed by Tyler's friend Ben McBride, Professor Norfolk and Charly fly in an airplane with the pilot Hogan to a distant place while Captain Lawton waits for their return on board of the Polar Queen. However they are hit by a pterodactyl and crash in a weird land of prehistoric animals. Soon they meet the native Ajor that surprisingly speaks English.
