A young psychiatric intern unearths secrets about the mental health facility in which he works.
The psychiatric intern Clark Stevens comes to Cunningham Hall, a mental health facility administrated by Dr. Franks, for a training period before his graduation from medical college. He gets close to the resident Sara and to Ben London, a dangerous patient lodged in cell 44 in the basement of the clinic. Clark becomes intrigued with a boy, who seems to be a ghost, and finds that Dr. Franks does not use real medication in the patients. A further investigation shows hidden dark secrets in the clinic.
