Dark Harvest's lawless marijuana landscape creates a web of sexual intrigue and violence in which the cop and grower are forced to settle their moral differences to stop a cunning psychopath.
On the eve of legalization, a marijuana grower is brutally murdered. His best friend, against the advice of his mentor (Cheech Marin, Up in Smoke (1978)), teams up with a suspended narcotics investigator (A.C. Peterson, Shooter (2007)) to find the killer. Dark Harvest's lawless marijuana landscape creates a web of sexual intrigue and violence in which the cop and grower are forced to settle their moral differences to stop a cunning psychopath, and uncover a truth much bigger than the stolen drugs. This gripping independent vision is full of revelations and twists and marks Cheech Marin's first marijuana movie since his final 'Cheech and Chong' film of the 80's. Hugh Dillon accompanies the all-star cast as they race to find the killer in this action thriller.
