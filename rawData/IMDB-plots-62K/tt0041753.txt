Minnie Mouse forces Pluto to wear a pink sweater she has just knitted. After she puts him outside, the poor dog frantically attempts to remove it.
Minnie has just finished knitting a bright pink sweater for Pluto, to his horror and kitten Figaro's amusement. He's thrown outside and has to hide from his canine buddies. After getting tangled up in the sweater Pluto goes in a lake, and the sweater barely covers his head. Minnie is reading the book "The Hooded Monster" when Pluto pops up and scares her, then she's crushed that the sweater has shrunk - until Pluto points out it's now the perfect size for Figaro.
