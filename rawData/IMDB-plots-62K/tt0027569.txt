The other children at a birthday party mock Elmer Elephant for his big nose, but it proves useful when he needs to save the birthday girl from a fire in her tree house.
Elmer brings flowers to Tillie Tiger's sixth birthday party. She leaves for a moment, and all the other animals mock Elmer's trunk. He leaves, and encounters a wise old giraffe. Meanwhile, Tillie's treehouse catches fire, and the monkeys fighting it aren't very effective. Elmer, the giraffe, and a few pelicans unite to put out of the fire and rescue Tillie.
Elmer Elephant attends Tillie Tiger's backyard birthday party. He enjoys himself, even though a hippo in attendance makes a too-powerful effort to help Tillie blow out her birthday candles and ends up blowing the entire cake in Elmer's face. The poor little elephant's fun ends when childhood cruelty rears its ugly head. A bully persuades the other kids to mock Elmer's big nose. Eventually, they throw him out of the party. A wise old giraffe attempts to console Elmer. Meanwhile, Tillie's tree house catches fire - with Tillie still in it. A trio of pelicans do what they can to deliver water in their pouches, as the firefighting monkeys make inept attempts to put out the mischievous little flames. Elmer comes to the rescue.
