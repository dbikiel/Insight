In the 1960s, a screwy Mexican General and his troops cross into Texas to re-capture the Alamo from the Gringos but they face opposition from the local police, the National Guard and the U.S. State Department.
When his girlfriend tells him that his men wouldn't follow him to a house of ill repute, Maximilian Rodrigues De Santos, a General in the Mexican Army, decides to perform some great act of heroism. He takes his men over the border into Texas and re-captures the Alamo. This upsets the Texans greatly. The Texas National Guard is sent to retake the mission. Normally, this would be easy, as Max's men have left all of their ammunition back in Mexico, but the State Department insists that no one be killed, and so the National Guard also goes in with unloaded weapons.
