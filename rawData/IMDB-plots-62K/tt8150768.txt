Nacho is an accountant, an average guy. At a party he meets Ana, a recently divorced and self confident young woman. Then they meet the charismatic bartender Sebastian, who starts flirting with both of them. Despite their doubts, Nacho and Ana accept Sebastian's invitation to spend the night at his place, where nothing happens. A few days later, they decide to go on a weekend trip to a secluded farm. And it seems like it will be a fun one-night-stand, until Sebastian confesses that he desires a long-term relationship with a man and a woman together.
