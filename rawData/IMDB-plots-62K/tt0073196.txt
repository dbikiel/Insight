The petite waitress Johnny works and lives in a truck-stop, where she's lonely and longs for love. She develops a crush on the garbage truck driver Krassky, although her sleazy boss Boris warns her that he's gay. Maybe because of her boyish looks, Krassky likes her too. Both don't notice the growing jealousy of Krassky's boyfriend Padovan - until an escalation.
The homosexual garbage truck driver Krassky and his partner Padovan stop at an isolated restaurant near the landfill where they work to drink a beer. They are served by the waitress Johnny and she explains that the sleazy owner Boris has given that nickname to her since she wears short hair and has small breasts. Her tomboy style attracts Krassky and she has a crush on him. Boris warns her that Krassky is gay but Johnny dates him. When they go to bed, Krassky fails; however, when he sees her laying down on her face, he gets excited and sodomizes her. They start an unusual relationship while Padovan gets jealous.
