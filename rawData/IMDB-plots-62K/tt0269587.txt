A film crew documents a folk story-exquisite corpse combination by random Thai people; the story is reenacted.
This film is an experimental mix of documentary and fiction. The film crew travels from the Thai countryside to Bangkok, asking the people they encounter along the way to continue a story about a handicapped boy and his teacher.
