The Biblical story of Salomé, a girl who agrees to perform the "dance of the seven veils" in return for John the Baptist's head on a silver platter.
After the lewd and frenetic Dance of the Seven Veils and with the solemn pledge from the very lips of Herod himself that she could have whatever her heart desires up to half his kingdom, wanton and proud young Salomé comes before her King with a frenzied and unreasonable demand. Beguiled by John the Baptist and then scorned for the sake of his God, the lascivious Salomé encouraged by her mother, the vindictive Herodias, commands that John be executed and his head delivered on a silver platter. And so, the King agrees.
SALOME the film is Oscar Wilde's most controversial work, banned in London in the late 19th Century. This scintillating tale of lust, greed and revenge follows the legend of King Herod and his lust for his young stepdaughter, Salomé, and her sexual baiting of John the Baptist. Wilde's adaptation has spawned multiple stage productions including an opera by Richard Strauss..
