A samurai discovers a cursed sword thrust through the heart of a straw man. With this weapon he slays all who oppose him, and many who do not. Men are scythed down as if they were made of straw.
In his long walks wandering through the thick and shady woods, a solitary samurai comes across a training straw dummy at the root of a tree, and through its lifeless heart, a pierced gleaming katana. Unable to resist, the battle-scarred warrior draws it out, unaware that the cursed blade is imbued with a dark sorcery so baneful and profoundly hungry that can transform its wielder into an omnipotent blood-thirsty fiend. Such evil power, however, rarely comes without cost.
