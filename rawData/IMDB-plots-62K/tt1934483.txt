A couple experiment with having an open relationship.
Luke and Sylvia are the very models of modern individuals in a metropolitan relationship. Enter Elena and Ronald, the free spirited polyamorous couple who are hellbent on getting Luke and Sylvia into bed. A fun slice of liberal San Francisco life told as a sex comedy, but much more sophisticated than a bedroom farce, YES WE'RE OPEN throws our unlikely heroes Luke and Sylvia into a hotbed of sex, jealousy, politics, sexual jealousy, sexual politics, sex and sex. And if they all play their cards right, there might even be some sex somewhere along the way.
