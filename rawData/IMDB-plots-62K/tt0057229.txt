The inextricably intertwined stories of five women who work as prostitutes just before the ban on brothels in Troumba.
The residents of a poor neighbourhood in Piraeus are asked to leave as modernization will take place. The prostitutes of one of the many brothels are preparing to move on. The camera follows their individual stories, their misery, shattered dreams and hopes for a better future.
At the decayed and disreputable neighbourhood of Troumba, next to the bustling port of Piraeus, the stories of five women working as prostitutes at a cheap and low-class brothel, are inextricably intertwined. Eleni, a reserved intellectual who grew up on the banks of Danube, has ended up in Greece after the war, while Mary, a virginal young woman, has embraced her new life after falling in love with an intriguing man. On the other hand, "Princess" Marina is secretly in love with a young student behind the back of her relentless pimp, and in the meantime, Anna protects her well-kept secret, as Mirsini is the only one who sees the imminent change. Under those circumstances, the girls find shelter in Madame Marie's bordello, just before the ban on brothels in Troumba.
Just a little time before the infamous brothels of Troumba (a slum of Peiraieus) are closed down, the story follows the lives of 5 prostitutes. Anna, in love with a gentle and wise sea captain, tries to hide the existence of her son. Marina is bullied by her good-for-nothing pimp, whom she loves to insanity. Mary falls in love with a teenage boy she deflowers. Myrsini, the youngest, deliberately becomes a prostitute and the madame's pet. But the story focuses most on Eleni, a sensitive refugee from Romania, who tries to hide her "dirty" profession from her beloved and to confront the sick passion of her pimp for her.
