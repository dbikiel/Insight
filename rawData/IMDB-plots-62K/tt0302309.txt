Mechanic Stella owns a gas station with introvert Lenni. When Stella accidentally kills Lenni's abusive mother, they try to dump the body. They run into trouble, thugs and cops but stick together as they fall in love with each other.
Fiery, dark-haired Stella, an intense auto mechanic, and nervous, blonde Eleonora (aka Lenni) are young and in love, and are from opposite ends of the social spectrum. They operate a gas station peacefully, until Lenni's mother appears and voices her disapproval of their lesbian romance. When Stella takes action in the heat of the moment, blood flies and the young women end up with a corpse on their hands. The lovers realize they must flee in order to stay together.
