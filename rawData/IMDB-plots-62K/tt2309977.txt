Transforming familiar objects into fresh guacamole.
In the delicate hands of an inspired and picky gourmet chef or a dedicated foodie, a ripe avocado fruit screams "Guacamole", Mexico's famous spread. The recipe is quite simple. After halving and dicing the avocado, you chop some coriander, a small onion, and a juicy red tomato. Of course, don't forget the indispensable chilli pepper and a splash of lime. Â¡Buen provecho.
