Dana Gould, the comedian and writer best known for his work on the hit TV show "The Simpsons," left that comfortable job to pursue his first love: stand-up comedy. In his highly anticipated special "I Know It's Wrong," Gould takes on the absurdities of modern life through his pop-culture obsessed lens. There's no middle-ground when it comes to the blaring, unapologetic, and off-the-wall funny special. Dana Gould has arrived, and the stand-up world is all the richer for it, in this special taped at the Neptune Theater in Seattle, WA.
