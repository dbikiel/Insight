Remake of the fairy tale classic.
Based on the fairy tale by The Brothers Grimm. Hansel and Gretel are abandoned after the famine strike in the village and where Hansel and Gretel are later trapped in the deceptively decorated house of the witch Griselda who wishes to fatten Hansel so that he may be baked into a delicious gingerbread treat.
In this live-action version of the classic fairy tale, Hansel and Gretel are the offspring of an impoverished woodcutter and his wife who wander into the woods in this Grimm Brother's fairy tale. The trail of bread crumbs they leave to find their way back is eaten by birds, and the children are lured into the gingerbread house of the wicked witch.
