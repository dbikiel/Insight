A rural village is divided when an extraordinary couple move into a mansion.
A small village in Västergötland, Sweden. Everything is turned upside-down when the local loner dies and his mansion, called House of Angels, is inherited by his unknown grand-daughter Fanny. She comes riding on a big black motorcycle with her best friend Zac, wearing black leather and spikes. The farmer Axel Flogfält had expected that he would be able to buy the mansion for a good price, but now it seems that Fanny and Zac will stay there. The village is divided into two camps, one for and one against them.
