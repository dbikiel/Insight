Young workers are dying because of a mysterious epidemic in a little village in Cornwall. Doctor Thompson is helpless and asks professor James Forbes for help. The professor and his daughter Sylvia travel to Thomson. Terrible things happen soon, beyond imagination or reality. Dead people are seen near an old, unused mine. Late people seem to live suddenly. Professor Forbes presumes that black magic is involved and someone has extraordinary power. He doesn't know how close he is: the dead become alive because of a magic voodoo-ritual, and so they must serve their master as mindless zombies...
In 1860, Sir James Forbes and his daughter Sylvia receive a letter from his former brilliant student Dr. Peter Tompson, who is married to an old school friend of Sylvia, Alice. In this letter, Peter tells that mysterious deaths are happening in the area where he is the local doctor. Sir James decides to visit the friends with Sylvia and to help Peter to find out what is happening. There, he realizes that the bodies of the new dead are disappearing from their graves. A further investigation shows them the existence of zombies in that location.
