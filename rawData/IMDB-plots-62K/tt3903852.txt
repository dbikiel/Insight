The Vigilante Diaries is a high octane action-adventure following The Vigilante (Paul Sloan) and The Kid (Kevin L. Walker) on dangerous adventures, from the mega-mansions and the underbelly of Los Angeles to far away places like Iraq, Armenia, Russia, and The United Kingdom. All of which are streamed online by film maker Mike Hanover (Jason Mewes). A trio of Asian femme fatales, to ruthless Armenian mobsters, to a pair of deep cover super spies hell bent on throwing the world into chaos.
When The Vigilante kills a man with deep connections, it triggers a bloodbath between the Armenian mob, Mexican cartels, a team of Special Force commandos, and an international black ops conspiracy that's about to make things very personal.
The Vigilante (Paul Sloan) and The Kid (Kevin L. Walker) embark on dangerous missions to clean up the streets. Those missions are streamed online by Mike Hanover (Jason Mewes) and then The Vigilante goes missing. The Kid recruits Wolfman (Rampage Jackson) to help him find and rescue the Vigilante.
