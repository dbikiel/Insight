The GI Joe Special Missions force must battle to build a counterweapon to Cobra's teleportation device.
The G.I. Joe Special Missions Force must contend with COBRA who, after a successful raid for a special broadcast satellite, now threatens the world with a revolutionary device called the MASS device which can snatch anything seemingly out of existence around the world as well as normal teleportation. GI Joe finds the original designer of the device who advises that the only way to counter that weapon is to build a MASS device of their own. However to do that, three rare catalytic elements are needed to power the device properly. Now the team must race around the world and find those supplies, while battling COBRA who has the same need for them as well.
