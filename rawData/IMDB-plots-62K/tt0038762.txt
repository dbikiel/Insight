The Earps battle the Clantons at the OK Corral in Tombstone, Arizona.
Wyatt Earp and his brothers Morgan and Virgil ride into Tombstone and leave brother James in charge of their cattle herd. On their return they find their cattle stolen and James dead. Wyatt takes on the job of town marshal, making his brothers deputies, and vows to stay in Tombstone until James' killers are found. He soon runs into the brooding, coughing, hard-drinking Doc Holliday as well as the sullen and vicious Clanton clan. Wyatt discovers the owner of a trinket stolen from James' dead body and the stage is set for the Earps' long-awaited revenge.
"My Darling Clementine" is John Ford's retelling of the Earp/Clanton fued, and the famous show down at the OK Corral. Ford embellishes on the story by centering the plot on the fictional character Clementine (Doc Holliday's schoolteacher flame from back east).
In 1882, Wyatt Earp and his brothers decide to settle in Tombstone after their cattle are rustled out from under them and their baby brother James is killed. Wyatt is a former town marshal and he gladly accepts that position in Tombstone along with his brothers as deputies. He soon becomes friends with the local saloon keeper Doc Holliday and he dispenses justice calmly and coolly. The Marshal has several run-ins with Ike Clanton and his four sons. When he is forced to kill Billy Clanton, it leads to the famous shoot-out at the OK Corral.
