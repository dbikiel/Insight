A drama about a young woman forced to take care of her alcoholic grandmother.
Amanda has a problem, if she is alone, she can't sleep. Her days pass in a calm, orderly fashion; she fills her nights with lovers that help her pass the hours. Her world is upset overnight when she has to take care of her old and alcoholic grandmother Dolores, a retired actress who now lives on memories of her past glory.
Amanda lives in a flat offered by her father, a famous actor with whom she is in bad terms. Although she has grown up in affluence, she is now adrift without a stable job. Besides this, she has also a psychological problem: she cannot sleep alone. Every night, she looks for someone to sleep with her, but the next morning this person is felt like a burden to her. This fragile balance is further shaken when she has to assist her grandmother, once a famous actress, and now an old person facing alcoholism and Alzheimer. Granmother and granddaughter will slowly get to know each other to discover their respective human and affective spheres.
