Their immune systems tragically damaged at birth, TOM AND LOLA are two beautiful children forever isolated in plastic bubbles. But neither cold urethane nor chillier hospital technicians can keep down the beguiling spirit of these indomitable siblings. Nor can anything stop their quest to one day run naked and truly free, unbound from the medical shackles that bind them. Magnifique!
