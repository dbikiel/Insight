A trio of guys try and make up for missed opportunities in childhood by forming a three-player baseball team to compete against standard children's Little League squads.
Three guys, all their lives, have been living in the shadow of bullies and are determined not to take it anymore. Now they must train with the help of Mel to take on the most offensive and meanest youth baseball teams.
When the owner of a minor landscaping service company, Gus, sees Nelson being abused by a group of baseball players, he defends the boy. The paperboy, Clark, tells them that his friend Richie and he have never played baseball so Gus invites them to play in the late afternoon. However, they are challenged by the bullies and they defeat the guys. The millionaire father of Nelson, Mel, invites Gus, Clark and Richie to form a team called The Benchwarmers and they become the sensation of the league, with a legion of outcast cheering for the team. However, when Gus' behavior during his childhood is discovered, the team and fans are affected.
