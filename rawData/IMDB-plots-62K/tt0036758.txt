Dragging along her spineless boyfriend Johnny, hare-brained secretary Kitty O'Day is unstoppable as she tries to determine her boss's murderer. In her exuberance she and Johnny keep running into more corpses, as well as the unbelievabley inept team of Inspector Clancy and his sergeant, Mike. Their luck seems to run out, though, as they deliver themselves right into the hands of the murderer.
Townley Hotel telephone operator Kitty O'Day and travel bureau clerk Johnny Jones, become involved in a murder when Kitty hears shots over the telephone. They investigate, find the body of a man and call the police. But when Inspector Clancy and police sergeant Mike arrive, the body has disappeared. As Kitty and Johnny have shown up before as somewhat bothersome amateur detectives on other cases, Clancy is inclined to believe there has been no murder. Jewel robberies of the hotel safe have occurred recently, and insurance investigator Tracey has been sent to investigate. More killing occurs and finally the body of businessman Williams, the first one killed, is found again. Carla Williams, the widow, and Nick Joel are suspected as Carla had claimed her husband was in Chicago. Kitty suspects hotel manager Sauter and goes to his room looking for clues.
