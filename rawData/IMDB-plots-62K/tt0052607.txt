Angela Barrows, an accomplished business analyst from the US, attempts to contemporise the late MacPherson's tweed factory, shaking the very foundation of a men-only company.
Man-eating businesswoman, Angela Barrows is sent by her US company to Edinburgh to investigate export opportunities. She meets businessman Robert MacPherson en route and he persuades her to help bring his company into the 20th century. The staff, lead by Mr. Martin, have other ideas and a battle between the old and new business methods breaks out.
Sadly, old MacPherson, the owner and founder of the House of MacPherson, passed away bestowing the firm to his heir, the frivolous son, Robert. Now, Robert, as the new chief of the MacPherson's tweed factory, he will fall for Angela Barrows, an accomplished business analyst from the US, and her avant-garde ideas for the company's contemporisation, in complete disregard though of the humble and respectable chief accountant Mr Martin's strong objection. But Angela is an actual force of nature with her glittering self-confidence, leaving no other choice for the traditional Mr Martin but to put things right again like a man, however, can he alone stop the sheer force of change?
