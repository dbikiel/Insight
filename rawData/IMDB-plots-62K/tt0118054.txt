Antonio takes a hit on his head when he's out to buy a jar of mushrooms for his wife, and loses his memory. He reappears five years later unaware that time has passed.
Antonio and Beatrice are a married couple and she's pregnant. One night she feels like eating artichokes under oil and he hurries to the supermarket to buy them. Unfortunately he's hit on the head by a packet of sugar, loses his memory and vanishes into thin air. He reappears five years later unaware of the time passed but Beatrice has now taken up with another guy, an opera singer, and doesn't want to see him any more. Antonio, however, does not want to give up:he wants his family and his house back.
