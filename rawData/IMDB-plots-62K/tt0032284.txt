Hoofers Johnny Brett and King Shaw have been trying to make it in New York. Befuddled producer Bob Casey wants a new partner for star Clare Bennett, but Brett thinks the caller is a bill collector and in a panic says that he is King Shaw. Because of this casting mixup, the wrong man gets a major role in a Broadway show. It looks as if Johnny, who deserves the part and who is falling for Clare while she is also falling for him, has lost his shot at stardom. Then King, the new leading man, gets drunk on opening night and someone else has to take his place... Includes numerous dance routines and Cole Porter songs, with the classic "Begin the Beguine."
