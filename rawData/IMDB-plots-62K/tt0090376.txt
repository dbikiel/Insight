Homeless kids need a place to stay, so they rent the club "The Zoo" out, from Old Leather Face. Later, a new gang attempts to take away their home. A fight ensues with thumbtacks and staplers as the weapons.
Tired of having nowhere to go for fun, Kate and her brother Ricky, and friends Bobbie, Danny and Val lease a dilapidated nightclub called The Zoo from an old drunk named Leatherface (Vereen). The Zoo becomes their home away from home AND an overnight success...that is, until the donnelly Clan catches wind of it. Little Joe Donnelly and his brawny but dimwitted twin brothers are a walking, talking trio of nuisance - where they go, trouble is sure to follow. And when they enter The Zoo ripe for a fight... a fight is just what they get. They have pushed The Zoo Gang too far and the battle for the club is on. Will the Gang be able to save their new found club from the greedy hands of the Donnelly Clan?
Leatherface is a mean-spirited drunk who allows a group of kids, led by Kate, Bobbi, Danny, and Val, to reopen the decrepit nightclub he owns as a teen hangout. One night Hardin, a new kid in town, saves Kate from Little Joe and his brothers. The jilted clan decides to get even for this snub, setting off a mini war with our pink-cheeked heroes. Eventually Little Joe brings in the family's elder brother, Goose, a bearded plug-ugly giant with an uncompromising temperament. Kate and company persuade Leatherface--who just happens to be a former champion wrestler--to serve as their bouncer, but his fighting skills aren't enough to stop the savage siblings.
