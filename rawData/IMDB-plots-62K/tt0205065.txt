"Firemen in working uniform, rubber coats, helmets, and boots. Thrilling rescue from burning building. Smoke effects are fine." - from the Edison Catalog
Thick smoke fills the air as a group of fire-fighters prepare for a rescue attempt. One of them, standing on a ladder, helps a young girl down to the ground in safety. A young boy comes next. The fire-fighter then climbs higher up the ladder to see if anyone else needs help.
