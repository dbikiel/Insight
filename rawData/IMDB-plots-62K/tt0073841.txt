A mountain man captures a beautiful, but a manipulative city woman and goes to excessive lengths to please her every whim.
"When cherry trees blossom, people have parties. They sit under the trees with food and beverages. 'Oh, how beautiful.' That's all nonsense...before that the trees were feared." In Under the Blossoming Cherry Trees, we are treated to one of Masahiro Shinoda's most terrifyingly beautiful works. Based on a shorty story by Ango Sakaguchi, the film tells the tale of a poor Mountain Man who kills his seven wives (six to be precise; he leaves one alive to be a servant) to please an alluring woman he has captured. As the film progresses, the Mountain Man goes to unimaginable lengths to please his New Wife, who is never satisfied. Directed by Masahiro Shinoda, based onthe novel by Ango Sakaguchi.
