A gang of thieves plan to make their fortune by stealing a shipment of contraceptive pills from Finisham maternity hospital. They assume disguises and infiltrate the hospital, but everything doesn't go according to plan. The hypochondriac consultant Sir Bernard Cutting, Matron and the doctors and nurses at Finisham have a habit of getting in the way.
The last of four Carry-on medical movies centres on the plan by a group of criminals to steal some contraceptive pills from the hospital which involves one of them (Cyril) dressing as a nurse. In this film, it is Sir Bernard (Williams) who is after Matron and not the other way round. With a great but slight appearance by Charles Hawtrey as Dr. Goode, and funny cameo appearances by Joan Sims and Kenneth Connor, the sub-plots in the film come together at the end when the criminals decide tonight's the night!
