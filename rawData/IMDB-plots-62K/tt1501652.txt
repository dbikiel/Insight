A funeral parlor employee looks to unravel a 10-year-old mystery.
Dylan, a young man working at a funeral parlor, is trying to unravel a mystery that shattered his life ten years earlier. After faking his own funeral to see who will show up, he befriends a mysterious street junkie and is reunited with an old love from his past. The lives of these three characters are transformed by supernatural forces as Dylan discovers that no one is who they seem to be.
There's an old adage that you can tell a man's true character by who shows up at his funeral. A young man who works at a funeral parlor does just that -- he places his own obituary in the local newspaper and only two people attend. A heroin addict he's never met...and his ex-girlfriend from ten years before. Who will be at your funeral?
