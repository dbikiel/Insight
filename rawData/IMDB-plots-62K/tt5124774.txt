A man returns from Bagram in Afghanistan and Guantanamo to tell the story.
Moazzam Begg has experienced a generation of conflict. The Confession captures the entirety of Begg's story, from his forced confession and testimony as a free man, to his experience as a British Muslim and living the War on Terror. Commissioned by BBC Storyville and the BFI, The Confession is a gripping account of the rise of modern jihad, its descent into terror and the disastrous reaction of the West.
