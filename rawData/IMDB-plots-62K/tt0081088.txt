Three women start a lunch wagon business but run into stiff resistance from their competitor Mr. Schmeckler: their presence is interfering with some sort of illegal activity he's involved in. While Schmeckler busies himself trying to sabotage their wagon, the women are busy falling in love with construction guys and rock musicians. Two bumbling diamond thieves create complications for both sides.
