A well-off Munich family offers boarding to a refugee. Diallo from Nigeria soon makes friends among the family members, but they are tested when they have to face racism, bureaucracy and terror suspicions because of him.
The recently retired teacher Angelika decides, against her skeptical husband Richard's will, to take in a refugee. Soon afterward, the young Nigerian Diallo moves into the Hartmann home, and a whirlwind of complications ensue. These events not only disrupt the lives of Angelika and Richard's adult children Philip and Sophie; they also put their own marriage as well as Diallo's chances of integration to the test. Despite all the chaos, hope prevails that the family will recover its stability, confidence, and peace - like the rest of Germany.
