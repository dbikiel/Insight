Old bank robber Henry, paralyzed from a stroke, is moved from a prison hospital to a retirement home, where Carol is a nurse. She doesn't believe he's paralyzed and sees him as a way out of her boring life.
Carol Ann MacKay is a fine, popular nurse at a retirement home, and spends her free time with her hunky athletic husband Wayne MacKay, who was the star of her school's football team when she was high school prom queen; he still would do anything for her, including cleaning up the messes her ideas get them in. When legendary bank robber Henry Manning, who had a major stroke in prison, is placed in the home, supposedly having lost all control over his body, she notices he must be in far better condition then he lets appear, and tries everything to find out- when she pushes his wheelchair in a canal at a picnic, Henry gives up. The McKays keep his secret and Henry doesn't actually run in Waynes car as his first impulse was; soon Carol gets his confidence and the two start planning how they three can commit another robbery on an armored money transport, which brings them together. It doesn't go quite according to plan, but they get the loot; however, before the money can be split some big surprises change everything...
Legendary bank robber Henry Manning pushes his luck too far and ends up in prison, where he suffers a massive stroke. He is transferred to a nursing home, in the care of Carol Ann McKay, a high school prom queen who married her boyfriend Wayne, the star of her school's football team, and whose glamour days are well behind her. After a few of her personal effects mysteriously disappear, Carol Ann starts to suspect that Henry isn't as sick as he seems, and she and Wayne are soon working with Henry to plan his last and greatest score.
