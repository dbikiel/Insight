An unfaithful newly-wed wife, an estranged father, a priest and an angry son suddenly find themselves in the most unexpected predicaments, each poised to experience their destiny, all on one fateful day.
A couple tries to dispose of a dead body; a little boy gets a surprise when he meets his estranged father; a son discovers his mother's other side; a religious man starts having doubts over his God. Super Deluxe gives us four stories and the protagonists in each of these stories are tested in their beliefs in the strangest ways.
