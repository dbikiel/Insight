Twenty year-old Chubasco chooses a difficult path of hard labor at sea aboard a fishing boat and learns about how to become a man in the process.
In San Diego, twenty year old Anton Rozy, nicknamed Chubasco like his now deceased Portuguese fisherman father, is a restless young man who only hangs out on the beach with his girlfriend, Bunny Marino, in having no aim in life. He is often in trouble with the law, largely for vagrancy, but his hotheadedness also adds assault, often against police officers, on top of those vagrancy charges. Bunny and Chubasco's relationship places them at odds with her father, Sebastian Marino, a fishing boat operator who can only see in Chubasco trouble. That strained relationship for Bunny only increases when she continues to keep in contact with Chubasco behind her father's back. As Chubasco hits his third strike with his latest arrest, exasperated Judge North believes he has one last trick up his legal sleeve to provide Chubasco some real guidance: instead of jail, he will learn the trade of his father by working on a tuna clipper, the Edna Belle. While some of the older crew knew or knew of Chubasco's father, they, with the exception of the captain, Laurindo, don't know the reason why he, who they see as an unskilled hippie, has been hired. Despite the difficult period of adjustment, Chubasco does gain some sense of responsibility and what seems to be a true calling that may have been handed down by blood from his father. This all means nothing without Bunny, but it's Sebastian he will have to convince, Sebastian who has no idea what happened to Chubasco besides being out of Bunny's life.
