A modern day treasure hunt for a mystical relic that turns into a love story for all time.
Deceptively sophisticated Eric arrives from Chicago on the Greek island of Patmos. He plans to continue his long-deceased father Phillip's quest for St. John the Evangelist's mythical cup near the dig run by old archaeology professor Tierrney, but now using ultra-modern scanning equipment. He soon locates it, but the problem is it's under the profitable tavern of widely popular Katarina Gambierakis, who also won his heart.
