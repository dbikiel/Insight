Graham struggles to connect the pieces of his shattered short-term memory. Unable to recall the most basic facts of his life and his sexual past, he quickly falls prey to the erotic appetites of the women he encounters.
Those who loved Graham yesterday shouldn't count on today. Those who love him today risk being heartbroken tomorrow...

But how can Graham really fall in love with her when he sees each time as the first time? Irene is about to experience all new ways of romance. She'll just have to remember everything for the both of them. Everyone around Graham has their reasons why he should or shouldn't fully recover...
