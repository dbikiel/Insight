In Touch is a story of people from a little Polish village called Stare Juchy (in Polish: Old Blood). The village is located in Masuria, area often referred as ''land of thousand lakes''. Around 400 people from this village have emigrated to Iceland since the 80's and nobody has returned. Those who stayed behind - most of them from the older generation - are hoping for the reunion. But by now their children and grandchildren are settling into new lives on the other side of Europe. The distance separating them is great and the journey expensive, so they don't get to hug each other very often. The best alternative is intensive contact by Skype.
