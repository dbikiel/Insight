Eric Saperston directs this amazing journey about a group of young Americans who decide to ask the age old question in life, "what do our elders have to pass down to us?"
After college, Eric Saperston bought a 1971 Volkswagen Bus, took his Golden Retriever, Jack, and set out to follow The Grateful Dead and work a ski season in Aspen. While out on the road, he called up some of the most powerful people in the world and asked them out for a cup of coffee.
