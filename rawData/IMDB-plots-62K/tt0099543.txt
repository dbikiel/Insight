Park any subtlety at the threshold. The spits and spats keep the anchor shining in this Naval officer adventure. Who knows what is next? The children are precious. The interplay between home, the office, and the boat keep you edgy. Sadness sets in as you see the decline of loyalty to purpose.
Fact based story of John A. Walker, Jr., a Navy Chief Warrant Officer with access to top secret cryptographic communications. As a result of mounting debts, he sold secrets to the Soviets in 1967, a practice that he continued thereafter. He further sought to involve his four children into the espionage until his wife caught onto his activities.
