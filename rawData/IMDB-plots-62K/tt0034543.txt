Show promoter Cartwright has stolen the songs that Frank wrote while he was in the big house. The boys go to Cartwright to get Frank credit for his work, and Cartwright has them arrested for extortion, of which they are innocent. Luckily, they are in the same paddy wagon as Pete and when his gang springs Pete, the boys are sprung. The only way that they can prove now that the songs are Frank's is to put on a show before Cartwright show 'Melody for You' opens. The boys and Patsy find a theater, paint the scenery and put all the kids in the neighborhood to work on the show. Pete Detroit makes sure that Cartwright's show does not open on the same night and that his cabs bring in an audience.
"Snap" Collins and Steve prevent the suicide of Frank Eastman, and learn from his daughter, Patsy, the cause of his despair. Eastman had composed a song and submitted it to a show producer who was using it and disputing Eastman's authorship. The producer tricks "Snap" and Steve into accepting a check, and then has them arrested as extortionists. They are rescued from police custody by a racketeer's henchmen, trying to spring their boss, and hide out in a loft, where they rehearse and put on a show that clears both Eastman and themselves
