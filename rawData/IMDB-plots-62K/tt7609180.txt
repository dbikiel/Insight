A father goes all out to clear his daughter from any wrong doing in the murder of his fiance. When all evidence points to her, he takes matters into to his own hands to save his daughter and outwit the judiciary system.
Tae-san is a man who truly has everything - money, fame, and power. Everything that a man can desire. He has two women who he wouldn't change for the world. They're his only daughter, Mira, and a chart- topping pop star fiancee, Yuna. Tae-san wants them to get along, but Mira doesn't take kindly to her stepmother-to-be. One day, Yuna gets killed in a horrific accident, and Mira is arrested as the suspect. Tae-san firmly believes that his daughter is not the killer and mobilizes all his resources to protect her. He finds out about Yuna's stalker, Dong-myung, who knows the truth about the accident, and he hires Hee-jung, a lawyer that Mira trusts like her sister. Working with them, Tae-san orchestrates a risky plot to find his fiancee's real killer. The man who has the world is about to change it.
