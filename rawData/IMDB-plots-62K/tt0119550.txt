The successful and wealthy TV actress Christine moves from Los Angeles to a small town in Romania with her son Kevin, her fiance Tony and her assistant Joanne to buy an old castle and construct a SPA following Tony's advice. Kevin does not like Tony and misses his friends that were left behind, but befriends the castle administrator Pavel. Soon Kevin encounters the ghost Sofia, who takes care of the castle that belonged to her family, and they become best friends. They discover that Tony has a love affair with Joanne and they are spending the money of Christine. Further, Sofia is getting weaker and weaker with the destruction of the castle. Now their only hope is to summon Sofia's mother to help her daughter to save the castle, but the spell is not working. Will Sofia vanish and the castle be totally destructed?
