Michel Racine is a feared president of Assize Court, as strict with himself as with others. Everything changes when he meets again Ditte when she's selected as a juror in a criminal trial over which he presides.
If you have to go to court, you pray not to have to appear before Michel Racine, an awfully ruthless judge. Unfortunately for him, this is what happens to Martial Beclin, a man accused of kicking to death his baby daughter. And you can easily guess what his feelings are on the first day of his trial. But neither Martial nor Michel knows it yet: this time, things may turn out differently. Why? Because judge Racine stops being himself the moment he recognizes among the jurors Ditte, a woman doctor he has been secretly in love for a couple of years...
