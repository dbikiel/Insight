A cinema director who is in an emotional and professional crisis thinks that he has discovered a French star when he meets an ordinary dancer.
Movie director John Gayle is fired by his best friend, a producer. He goes to the beach and wanders into a carnival. There he sees a cleaver Irish girl, Mary O'Leary, and decides to 'discover' her and regain his job. He takers her to his home and does a series of "Pygmalion" experiments with her. She becomes a fine actress and is hired by the movie studio, who believe her to be a FRench heiress. Gayle is hired to direct her but when she gives away the whole hoax, he is fired again.
