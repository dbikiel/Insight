From the rocky center of a fountain a fairy emerges, and with a wave of her wand she causes to appear a huge, green bullfrog, which begins to hop around the fountain. Suddenly the rocks disappear and the scene is enveloped in showers of multi-colored fire; when the rocks again appear there is a tableau of posing girls revolving round it. Several changes of pose and costume now take place, embracing the artistic employment of white horses and heroic male figures, and one change reveals only a gigantic green frog. The film closes with the appearance of the fairy once more.
