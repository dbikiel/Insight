Narration: At the one kilometer mark, Anoufriev has caught up to the Australian. He leads in front of Mimoun in the black jersey. Zátopek, number 903, has so far only managed eighth place. At 2,000 meters, Zátopek has gained ground. He is now on the heels of the Russian, along with the leggy Englishman and Mimoun. Finally, after 2.5 kilometers, Emil Zátopek has taken off; he has taken the lead. Mimoun and Anoufriev follow him but the Czech's pace is very quick.
