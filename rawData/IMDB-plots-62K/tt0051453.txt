Sergeant Grimshaw wants to retire in the flush of success by winning the Star Squad prize with his very last platoon of newly called-up National Servicemen. But what a motley bunch they turn out to be, and it's up to Grimshaw to put the no-hopers through their paces.
A bunch of new recruits are called up for nation service, their Sergeant has a Â£50 bet with the other sergeants that his last squad before he retires from the army will be the champion squad that year. However it becomes quickly apparent to him that he has his work cut out.
