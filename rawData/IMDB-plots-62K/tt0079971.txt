The superhero Kronos, from a distant galaxy, tangles with the mad scientist Dr. Gulik over the fate of mankind.
An alien, "Supersonic Man," is sent to Earth to thwart the plans of evil men who would destroy the galaxy itself with their weapons. Only his superpowers, which include flight, bulletproof skin, and the ability to turn guns into bananas, can save Earth from destruction.
The alien Kronos is sent to the Earth, under the identity of Supersonic Man, in order to save it from Dr. Gulik's evil plans, namely rule the planet and kidnap Patricia, an eminent scientist's daughter and Supersonic's love interest, which involve such dangerous methods that could "break the Galaxy's equilibrium". This superhero possesses mighty powers such as flying, extraordinary strength, throwing fire and transforming handguns into bananas; he is also given a human identity, Paul, a reporter who can change back to superhero by activating a watch device and saying: "May the Great Force of the Galaxy be with me".
