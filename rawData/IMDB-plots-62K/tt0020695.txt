When the body of a man nicknamed "Cock Robin" is found with an arrow in the heart on an archery range along with a chess bishop as a clue, Philo Vance investigates.
The murders start with the body of Robin. He is found with a arrow through the heart, but Vance deduces that the body was placed and not found where he was killed. The note found dealing with the murder was part of a nursery rhyme and signed by 'Bishop'. The only witness may have been Mrs. Drukker and Adolph, but they are not talking. As the murders progress, each one is accompanied by a nursery rhyme. It is up to Philo Vance to unravel the clues and unmask the identity of the murderer 'Bishop'.
Detective Philo Vance is called in to investigate the murder of Joseph Cochrane Robin, wealthy man found dead with an arrow through his heart, and a chess-bishop and a note in 'MotherGoose' rhyme next to his body. Before Vance can get started, another murder occurs. Then a series of murders, all with black-bishops and nursery-rhymes attached. Just before the rest of the cast is murdered, ace-investigator Vance suddenly gets a clue by actually getting a clue.
