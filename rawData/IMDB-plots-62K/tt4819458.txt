A lonely computer programmer exacts harsh revenge on three teenage girls after they play a cruel prank on him.
What starts out as a harmless prank blog takes a dark turn for 17-year-old Avery when her friends, Mandy and Kaley, create a fake profile for an international dating site and begin to communicate with a lonely, socially inept computer programmer named John. Having lived a life of isolation and bullying, the humiliation he feels when he realizes he's been duped unleashes a wrath that no one would have expected.
Socially awkward loner John, who lives across a hooker and makes good money as computer programmer, is lonely enough to apply for a Filippino mail order bride. But she's a fictitious profile on a fake website. created by insensitive Kaley's bunch of teens as another mean 'prank' for a their gross video-blog. Finding he spent a small fortune to have his heart broken for all Internet to see, John is hell-bent on revenge. He uses his ICT skills to track the bitch bunch down and hires gay toyboy Nick to set a trap for reach in turn. Mandy, whose picture featured, her more sensible cahoot Avery Lindstrom, both apologetic but not convincing enough, and finally ringleader Kaley, who remains abusive even in handcuffs, end up first in basement, then in a truck to be sold to white slavers.
