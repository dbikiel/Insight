A lawyer suffers a guilt complex after getting a murder acquittal for his client, and then finding out she did commit the crime.
A lawyer wins an acquittal for his client, a woman accused of murder. After the verdict, he finds out that she indeed did commit the murder and manipulated him to win her acquittal. Guilt-ridden, and knowing that she can't be tried again for the murder, he devises a plan to bring her to justice.
Attorney Craig Carlson (Raymond Burr) has to make a difficult decision when he falls in love with Myra Leeds (Angela Lansbury) as she happens to be the wife of his best friend and former war buddy Joe Leeds (Dick Foran). Craig meets with Joe and tells him he wants Myra to divorce him so he can marry her. Joe values the friendship he and Craig have and respects the attorney and overall has conflicting feelings about Myra. After thinking things over Myra goes home late one night and Myra shoots him and is arrested and tried for murder. Craig takes the case and during the summation tells the jury that Joe may have threatened Myra and caused her to shoot and that he is in love with the woman. When Myra is acquitted she and Craig make plans to marry until the attorney receives a letter from his dead friend Joe which opens his eyes to some things he didn't know and he makes a gamble to bring Myra to justice.
