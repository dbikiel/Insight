Although he has great sex with Luigia, grifter Benito becomes obsessed with sex and starts fantasizing about and bedding every woman he sees. Eventually, this obsession consumes him.
Benito Balducci, the lonely door-to-door toilet detergent salesman, is utterly dominated by two powerful obsessions: loving his body, and loving to have sex. Shamelessly and openly embracing his vices, Benito is also a meticulous diary keeper of his intensely erotic fantasies partially triggered by Luigia--his insatiable girlfriend who always tries to make him jealous--and Rome's beautiful women. Blondes or brunettes, all seem to be able to provoke his wild appetite and imagination; however, pretty soon, Benito will have to make a decision: it's either them or Luigia.
