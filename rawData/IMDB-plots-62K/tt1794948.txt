Defending a friend, duckling is attacked by fox and must learn to survive.
Once a duck named Gray Neck saved a hare, which was attacked by a fox. The hare remained alive and unharmed, and the fox overlapped the wing of the duck and she could not fly south with the rest of the birds. There remained the Gray Neck to winter in the glade, which, freezing every day, became less and less. And the fox got into the habit of coming to the glade while waiting until she could get a duck. The Gray neck had to fight for her life, escaping from the treacherous fox, but thanks to her friendship with the hare and the wood grouse, she managed not to become a dinner for the red-headed predator.
