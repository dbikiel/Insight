A Movie kidding about the usual scenes used in vernacular, mostly Tamil movies.
The film's plot parodies contemporary commercial films in Tamil cinema, mocking the stereotypical scenes. It also probes into social evils like female infanticide, poverty, violence against women, blind devotion for actors et cetera with great insight and humour. The movie primarily revolves around a male infant, who is rescued by an old woman from the verge of being killed. What kind of challenges with this child have to face at every stage of life? How will he deal with life and love?
