When a new family moves to an old house in Amityville, they are tormented and tortured by an evil spirit living in the home while trapped by the malicious townspeople who want to keep them there.
Eager to start anew, the family of Todd and Jessica, along with their teenage daughter, Hailey, move in with the troubled relative, Aunt Shae, who, unwittingly, is living in a cursed house in Amityville. Before long, Shae starts experiencing strange and vivid hallucinations, and, little by little, a dark supernatural force creeps into the house. Now, a well-hidden secret which dates back decades is about to resurface, as the demonic stranglehold on Shae ushers in a new era of terror. Has the unsuspecting family walked right into a trap? Can they set themselves free from Amityville's infernal portal?
