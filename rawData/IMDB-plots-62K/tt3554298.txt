(1959) Horst Frank, Michel Simon, Paul Dahlke. A must-see film! A serum that keeps severed portions of the human body alive is used by a mand doctor on its own inventors decapitated head. This guy is really loony tunes (his girl friend's a knockout!). Chilling and atmospheric. A very gothic sci-fi horror film. 35mm.
