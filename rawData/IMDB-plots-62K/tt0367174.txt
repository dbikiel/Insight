This is a movie about two people (Gigi Leung and Takeshi Kaneshiro), who are destined to be together but by some twist of circumstances they never find each other.
John Liu is an aspiring violinist who is flocked by women like bees to honey because of his handsome face. However what he really wants is to meet someone special who appreciates his violin performance. Eve Choi is a professional translator whose true passion is translating love poems, but for work she is stuck in translating cheesy novels and cheap thrillers which make her feel tense and frightened. Living in different units of the same apartment building, separated by one thin wall, they have brushed shoulders in crowd hundreds times, but their paths never really cross. One day in the park, they finally bump into each other and spend a beautiful afternoon together. Rain starts. They exchange phone numbers and quickly run home, but the rain has soaked through their precious scrap of paper and the phone numbers are hopelessly smudged.
