Heli (Anu Sinisalo), an art teacher is still in love with her husband, Matti (Ville Virtanen) as they were on the first day of their encounter. They have a13-year-old daughter. Heli is in a midlife rut. Because, unfortunately, her husband shows no real intimacy in her and is only concerned with video games. Subtle hints, beautiful words, sexy clothes and direct action: Whatever she undertakes to seduce him is useless. At last she can't resist seductions of her young student Jarno (Kai Vaine) and begins a torrid affair with him-and eventually learns what she's really been missing. But not everything goes according to plan.
