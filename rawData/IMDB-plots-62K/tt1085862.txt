Two strangers run from unknown assailants that stalk them through the woods.
Quim drives around an isolated rural area through a maze of lanes. When he drives into the woods, he gets lost. Trying to find his direction, he suddenly gets shot from the hill. On his escape from gunshots, he meets Bea, an attractive young woman, who apparently is lost as well. Suspicious of each other, they join forces to run away through the forest, unprotected, cold, hunted...
As Quim stops at a gas station on the way to his ex-girlfriend, the beautiful shoplifter, Bea, catches his eye. Before long, as one thing leads to another, the two perfect strangers will find themselves at the mercy of an invisible sniper after a detour through the hills, forcing them to run for their lives in the remote woodland area. What was Quim and Bea's mistake? Can the two human targets escape from the king of the mountain?
