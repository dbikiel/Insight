In the 1930s, organized crime came to England. The Italian Sabinis and English White family in West End dominated the London underworld. Come WWII and Jack "Spot" took over and later Billy Hill.
Dramatising the violent reign of two of London's most notorious gangsters, Billy Hill (Leo Gregory) and Jack 'Spot' Comer (Terry Stone), ONCE UPON A TIME IN LONDON charts the legendary rise and fall of a nationwide criminal empire that lasted until the mid-fifties and which paved the way for the notorious Kray Twins and The Richardsons.
