This fast-paced, imaginatively compiled "unauthorized biography" of the former Italian Prime Minister features solely words spoken by Berlusconi in interviews, rallies, and public statements. It relates the story of an icon, a living symbol of Italy, seemingly influencing every major development in Italy, spreading his inimitable self-confidence and optimism to those in need of a guiding hand.
