Noted writer Kenneth Bixby, in love with his witty secretary Anne Rogers, nevertheless agrees to a tete-a-tete with a former college fling, loopy Danish girl Julie who is married to penny-pinching Harvey Wilson. Bixby realizes he is in way over his head when he finds out he has become the co-respondent in a divorce lawsuit filed by Wison.
Ken is a noted novelist who is engaged to his personal secretary, Anne. In Cleveland on a book tour, he meets Julie, who thinks that she is the Miriam that he describes in his novels. It seems that they went together eight years earlier in college and she wants to restart the affair. Arthur and Elizabeth are trying to keep them apart as Julie is married to Harvey and they do not want the family involved in a scandal. Ken is spineless and Anne is furious.
