A documentary on Ed Koch, the mayor of New York City from 1978 to 1989.
Three-time New York City Mayor (1978-1989) Ed Koch was combative, funny, and blunt. He was also intensely private. 'Koch' gives us a contemporary history of the world's greatest city, and an intimate portrait of the 86-year old former mayor, as he confronts his own mortality and legacy. The film examines issues still relevant today - race, homelessness, AIDS, and gay rights - and gives us a window into the trials and tribulations of the nation's most famous mayor in the world's most wondrous city.
