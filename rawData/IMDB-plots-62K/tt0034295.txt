Hobo Donald steals dinner off Pegleg Pete's table. Pete gives Donald a stick of dynamite. Then he puts Donald to work chopping trees. To say Donald is an inept lumberjack is understating the case. After several mishaps, Pete/Pierre chases Donald on railroad handcars.
Donald cheerfully follows the hobo trail trough the wide forest. Passing the yummy spread at "Pierre's", he can't resist to steal some delicacies, but gets caught by giant lumberjack Pegleg Pete (Pierre is French for Pete), who decides to make him pay for his stealing by working with him, only to find that the unwilling lumber-duck whose malingering he overcomes with sheer physical superiority is less of a help then a horrible hazard. Losing his patience with the lost cause, Pete starts chasing Donald with his ax, determined to chop him into a duck dish, first on foot, soon pushing railroad handcars till those are destroyed by overstraining and malicious blows from Pete...
