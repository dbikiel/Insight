A happy-go-lucky man with wit and an instinct to kill teams up with a timid cop after being pursued by the criminal whose plans to rob a bank he foiled.
Ravi is a happy go lucky man willing to live a peaceful life. One day, in order to make money, he goes to bet, but in between encounters the police, whose point of concern is the stolen money from a famous bank of the city. This robbery was executed by none other than Bittu, who's too sharp at planning. Since Bittu and Ravi had met each other the same night, when Bittu gave Ravi lift, Ravi uses his razor sharp brain to get him arrested by the police. But soon, with the help of his gang, Bittu gets rescued, who now vows to seek revenge on Ravi. Realising the danger he would face, the police sends him away from the city to a policeman's house, with the help of whom he executes thrilling and mysterious plans in order to deceive Bittu. Whether he's able to recover the money or not forms the rest of this action packed film.
