In order to convince Raimonda, a wealthy noble woman, to finance his project for a holiday resort, Saverio, a lawyer gets engaged to Clotilde, her mentally-disturbed and sex-obsessed adolescent daughter. He plans to have her kidnapped and raped by an accomplice so she won't be a virgin anymore and he'll have an excuse to get out of the impending marriage. But what he doesn't plan is to fall in love with the girl.
