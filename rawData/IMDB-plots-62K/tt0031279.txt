From the slums emerge a policeman (Richmond) and a criminal (Norris) whose sister (Duff) loves the policeman who father has been murdered.
An embittered Louie Peronni (Edward Norris) returns from prison to find that his sister, Juli Peronni (Amanda Duff), is engaged to policeman Eddie Farrell (Kane Richmond), and also finds that his secret wife Annie Qualen (June Gale) has placed their baby girl in a foundling home. With his old gang again, Louie plans a robbery of a fur warehouse. Louie shoots down the night watchman and is trailed home where his father Guiseppe Peronni (Henry Armetta) persuades him not to fight it out with the police. Determined to let Louie take the full rap, the gang kidnaps the district attorney's daughter. Annie informs Louie that the kidnapped child is really their own and was adopted from the foundling home.
