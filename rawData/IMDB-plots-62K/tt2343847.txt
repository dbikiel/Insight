The movie is based on the actual life of party workers who have aligned their loyalty towards a particular political party, and also loosely based on the most reputed and powerful political family of Balasaheb Thackeray. It highlights the glorious past of party and strong organisation fighting for Marathi community in Maharashtra, India.

When the leadership baton is passed on to the next generation, one of the new leaders breaks away from the core. What follows is the rift between friends who were once bonded together by the cause led by the party and now finding themselves opposing each other.
