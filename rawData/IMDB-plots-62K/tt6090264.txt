A portrait of poverty, ambition and hope set in a world of waste.
This film tells a story about an unschooled 11-year-old girl Yi-Jie, she's a truly global child who learns the world through the United Nations of Wastes while working with her YI minority parents in this recycle workshop thousand miles away from their mountain village home town. Going to school is all she longing for. And the ambitious boss of the workshop Kun, who works so hard for trying to give his family a better life. Through the story of these two families, the film explores how these wastes recycled by the bare hands of families, and discovers their dilemma and choices of suffering irreversible damages on life just to make a living. It also observes that the world is flat and issues don't go away by changing time and location - we're all in this together.
Laughter of playing children echoes through the rolling hills of plastic waste. This recycling plant is home to Pen, his daughter Yi Jie, who is desperate for an education, and boss Kun, determined to improve his family's lot. This poetic doc exposes the lives of those on the fringes of global capitalist realities, a far cry from the communist dream.
