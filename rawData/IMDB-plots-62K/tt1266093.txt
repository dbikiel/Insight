NOBODY'S PERFECT is a documentary which shows Niko von Glasow's search for eleven people who, like him, were born disabled due to the side effects of the drug thalidomide. These eleven people are also prepared to be photographed for a calendar, and photographed naked, allowing people who would otherwise glance furtively at thalidomiders to take a good, long look. In the process Niko discovers a range of fascinating characters who have learned to lead an impressively "normal" life, which incorporates their disability. With black humour, and paying no heed to political correctness, NOBODY'S PERFECT gives a portrait of twelve extraordinary personalities who react with curiosity, enthusiasm or horror (like Niko himself) to the project.
