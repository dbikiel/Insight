A woman who heads a sportswear manufacturing company is found dead. Although it is ruled a suicide, the police detective in charge believes she was murdered, and his subsequent investigation begins to focus on the woman's son, who was blinded by her in an accident several years before.
In the second of five films produced by Ben Schwab starring Bill Elliott as a police lieutenant in the L.A. Sheriff's department, Lieutenant Andy Doyle suspects murder rather than suicide, when wealthy Mrs. Curtis is found dead in her bedroom. All indications lead Doyle to suspect her blind son Wally, who blames her for his blindness, of having killed his mother. With money left him by his mother, Wally undergoes a successful eye operation, a fact he keeps hidden from all but his doctor and his fianc√©e, Phyllis Baxter. Feigning blindness, Wally and Phyllis set out to clear him and find the real killer. Raymond Wilkins, his mother's business partner is his chief suspect. When Wilkins' attorney is found murdered, Doyle and Wally renew their efforts. Wally discovers that Wilkins is involved romantically with one of his models, a situation requiring a lot of money to maintain. Wally obtains enough evidence to prove that Wilkins murdered Mrs. Curtis and his attorney, and Doyle and his men make the arrest.
