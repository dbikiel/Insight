A paralyzed gay bicycle racer risks home, relationships and personal health to reenter the fray as a paraplegic racer.
Morgan comes home after a tragic accident in a bikers race leaves him paraplegic, binding him to wheelchair use for the rest of his life. He tries to stay positive, not letting the accident end his life, but deep-rooted feelings of uselessness make him rather wish he were dead. Rolling out for beer, he meets Dean, and the two strike up a friendship that quickly develops into a romantic connection. Morgan wants to participate in the biking race in the handicap category, more so because of his competitive nature than to prove his ability. Everyone is against it, even Dean, leading to differences between the two. Finally, he realizes that he's at fault and makes peace with himself.
Home after a terrible accident leaves him paraplegic, Morgan tries to stay positive and not let his new condition redefine his life. Despite feeling somewhat useless, he soon finds love with a man playing basketball in the park. Now he's ready to race again, but his erectile dysfunction medication (to please his new boyfriend) interferes with his heart's ability to function athletically. With his competitive self-worth thus impinged, Morgan takes it out on those around him, pushing everyone away before heading out alone to prove he can conquer the hill that made him wheelchair-bound.
