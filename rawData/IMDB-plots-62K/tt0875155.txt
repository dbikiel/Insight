Before the time of recorded history, the Atlantic Ocean harbored a magnificent continent on which civilization flourished. Unfortunately, brutal wars and natural disasters have nearly leveled the once thriving society. Tieh, Lakushi, and Bois are three survivors of the wars and disasters who wander the land, hoping to find some last vestige of civilization. When they do, the city they find is populated by the dead who lord over the living, forcing the three to rely on their wits and skills to survive.
Three adventurers - a warrior, a sorcerer priest, and a young woman - traverse a land devastated by centuries of environmental calamities searching only for a way to survive. Their journey leads them to Azec Sistra, the legendary City of the Dead. Unfortunately, bandits have also found their way to the city and are searching for a hidden treasure within. However, there is a greater danger: the spirit guardians that protect Azec Sistra from those who would violate the spirits that rest therein.
