For more than three decades, aging Iranian Mohamad Sardari (Zadour Bonyadi) has worked as a crossing guard at a desolate train station. Through the years, Mohamad has done little to stifle the loneliness and boredom inherent in the job. Meanwhile, back at his family home, life is similarly uneventful: Mohamad's wife passes the time sewing night and day, especially since the couple's son left to join the army. As time passes, Mohamad mechanically continues to do his duty.
In this artful and heartfelt drama, an elderly railway signalman and his wife lead a solitary existence living by a railway line that passes through a village in Iran. Every day the signalman works the track while his wife weaves carpets at home. They live a picturesque existence, with hopes for a peaceful retirement on the horizon. But when the signalman passes his job onto a younger man, the couple realizes their still and tranquil life came at a price, one they can now no longer afford to pay.
