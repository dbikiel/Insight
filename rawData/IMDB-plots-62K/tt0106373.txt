Three Australian stories of the supernatural are recounted in this anthology. 1. Rick (Jack Charles), an Aboriginal boy living near a swamp on Bribie Island, is haunted by an American solider who drowned in quicksand. He is befriended by a shop-keeper, the daughter of the first European road engineer who built the first sealed road on the island.
2. Choo choo: Ruby (Tracey Moffatt) and her family live in a house near long-abandoned train tracks, which still carry ghostly apparitions. Mature-age Ruby is played by Auriel Andrew, an Indigenous Australian country musician of the Arrernte people. Ruby and her husband were haunted by min-min lights and the ghost of a young girl appearing at night on the railway tracks.
3. A landlord (Lex Marinos) has trouble evicting the tenants of an old warehouse: a couple that's been dead for years. A woman of Torres Strait Island background pines for her lost son, while a Greek woman in traditional costume taunts the landlord and mocks his attempt to sell the warehouse property to a casino developer.
