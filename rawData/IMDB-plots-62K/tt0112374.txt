Annie (Ashley Johnson) is back. Along with her friends Molly (Camilla Belle), Hannah (Emily Ann Lloyd), her dog Sandy (Jessie), and her wealthy father Oliver "Daddy" Warbucks (George Hearn). They take a trip to England where "Daddy" Warbucks is going to be Knighted by the King. Annie and the gang stumble onto a wicked scheme led by evil noblewoman Lady Edwina Hogbottom (Dame Joan Collins) who plans to blow up Buckingham Palace so she can become Queen and claim the throne for herself. And now it is up to Annie and her friends to stop her.
