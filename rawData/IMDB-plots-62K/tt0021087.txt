In this light romantic comedy, 17-year old Loretta Young is cast as Ann Harper, a wealthy socialite who has inherited a fortune provided the family is involved in no scandals appearing in print, and her two aunts and uncle consent to the marriage. Put off by all this, she is determined to cause a scandal so that none of the family will receive any of the inheritance. An arrow-straight Fairbanks is volunteered to be the one to "compromise" her, but the two end up falling for each other. Upon being discovered in Loretta's boudoir, Fairbanks makes a hasty exit out of the nearest window. The romance seems destined to fail, but Fairbanks (and his two friends) have other ideas, which are accidentally "aided" by the two prudish aunts.
