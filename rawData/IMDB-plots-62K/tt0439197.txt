The classic children's story of a young orphan girl and her crusty grandfather and their life in the mountains is told in this handsome production. With Geraldine Chaplin and Dame Diana Rigg.
Swiss girl Adelheid "Heidi" (Emma Bolger) is orphaned young. Aunt Detie (Pauline McLynn) brings her to Uncle Alp (Max Von Sydow), who lives isolated in the Alps since his murder charge. Heidi soon takes to the wild country, especially accompanying young goat herder Peter (Sam Friend). Uncle Alp refuses to send her to school in the city, but Aunt Detie returns and forces him to give in. She's sent to a posh lady in Frankfurt, where she'll be a companion for crippled daughter Clara (Jessica Claridge) after school hours.
