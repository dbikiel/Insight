Brash young politician Kuraudo Sekin has formed an elite security bureau to crack down on juvenile crime. But due to its extreme methods of justice, the bureau's most promising young member, Yui Kazama (Yui Asaka), refuses to aid them any further and resigns. Now it seems that the bureau may have a shadier purpose - to take over the Japanese government. So now Yui and her sisters must lead the resistance to oppose the evil bureau and save Japan from a coup d'Ã©tat.
