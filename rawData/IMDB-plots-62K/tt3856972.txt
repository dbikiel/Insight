Everyday millions of people are diagnosed with chronic illness. With best intentions doctors prescribe medications, diet and lifestyle changes or surgeries but are often unable to offer reasons or cures for the illness. The Connection considers whether there is a missing link in our approach to health care, and reveals that modern science is proving a direct connection between our mind and our health. The film features the world's leading scientists, researchers, writers and doctors, as well as remarkable true stories of people adding mind body medicine to their prescription and recovering from severe back pain, heart disease, infertility, cancer and multiple sclerosis. US experts included in the film include Dr. Herbert Benson, Jon Kabat Zinn, Dr. Dean Ornish, Dr. Esther Sternberg, Dr. David Spiegel and Dr. Andrew Weil
