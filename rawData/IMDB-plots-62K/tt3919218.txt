When "town slut" turned sex columnist Cassie Cranston returns for her mother's funeral it spices things up in the small town of Beaver's Ridge when a group of eccentric town folk, each with their own motives, convince her to plan an orgy.
How to Plan an Orgy in a Small Town is about a group of friends who live in the picturesque town of Beaver's Ridge-the epitome of wholesomeness and strong family values. Their orderly life is interrupted by the homecoming of Cassie Cranston, whom they slut-shamed into leaving town when she was a teenager. Now a big-city sex writer, Cassie returns home to face an unwelcome reception by her former friends, and finds an opportunity to seek revenge by writing a book about them when they ask her if she'll help them plan an orgy.
