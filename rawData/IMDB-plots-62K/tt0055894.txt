After an unusual meteor shower leaves most of the human population blind, a merchant navy officer must find a way to conquer tall, aggressive plants which are feeding on people and animals.
A shower of meteorites produces a glow that blinds anyone that looks at it. As it was such a beautiful sight, most people were watching, and as a consequence, 99% of the population go blind. In the original novel, this chaos results in the escape of some Triffids: experimental plants that are capable of moving themselves around and attacking people. In the film version, however, the Triffids are not experimental plants. Instead they are space aliens whose spores have arrived in an earlier meteor shower.
On a beautiful clear night, people around the world are treated to a spectacular meteor shower. In London, Bill Masen misses the show as he is in hospital with his eyes bandaged. The next morning he awakens to find no one answering his bell. He removes the bandages himself and soon realizes that he one of the few people with sight as everyone who observed the meteor shower is now blind. Society has broken down and Bill rescues a young sighted girl. Their challenge is not only to survive in this new world but to survive the onslaught of triffids, flesh eating plants that are now growing rapidly and consuming humans.
