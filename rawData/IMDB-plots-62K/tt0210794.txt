In 1938, Jewish rights activist Emma Sachs is targeted by the Nazis. When she dies, foul play is suspected. But was it the Nazis, or was it someone else? Detective Tony Rossini investigates, along with Larry "Cash" Carter, a theatre director connected to Mrs. Sachs and her family.
Set in the mid-1930's, a Nazi-resister (Claire Bloom) is paying to help the Jews escape pre-WWII Germany. This makes her very unpopular and subject for murder. However, back on the homefront, multiple family members and acquaintances also may have reasons for wanting her dead - not the least are the large inheritances that they would all receive. In Agatha Christie-fashion, theater director &amp; part-time sleuth Cash Carter (Gene Wilder) teams with a real detective (Mike Starr) to wade through the suspects. Cherry Jones also appears in the recurring role of Cash's flight attendant fiancee.
