A septuagenarian couple are attracted to each other in a retirement home but find the institution and their fellow patients frown on their relationship.
Adelina, a former "Miss Smiles" beauty queen, is a resident at a senior citizen retirement home. Her joie de vie and unfaded beauty make her attractive to the male residents, especially Andrea, a dapper and charming but married septuagenarian. Their initial mutual attraction evolves into physical desire, but their families and the conservative culture of the institution conspire against their consummating their love.
