The star of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" returns in a story about frat boys lost in the big city while hunted by a violent leader and his elite gang of gun-happy guards.
A group of protesters who call themselves "mutants" have taken over the inner city streets of a large city. They dress weird to try and show the effects of toxic poisoning. One of the mutants, Splatter, has really been affected. A group of fraternity boys decide to go into the mutant territory and kidnap one of the mutants as a prank. They inadvertently get framed for the murder of the mutant leader and are hunted through the abandoned buildings and dark streets by a crazed Splatter and his gang.
When frat boys are hated by the whole Fraternity, the five trouble makers are sent out on a phony kidnapping for Eddie Pain, the leader of a seemingly harmless protest group called Anti-Nuke Mutants. Protestors dressed in bizarre fashions and make-up to draw attention to their cause on stopping nuclear technology. But Eddie's top guard Splatter (played by Edwin Neal) kills one of the Frats, and Eddie as well. Now the Frat boys are lost in the city, their car is destroyed, and they're wanted by every mutant. Now their only hope is Julie and Eddie's girlfriend Dorothy (played by Marilyn Burns) who is hell bent on taking revenge on Eddie's killer Splatter.
