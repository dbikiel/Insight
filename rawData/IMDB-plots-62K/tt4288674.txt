A pulpy, action monster movie, inspired by Cinemaware's cult 1980s video game "It Came from the Desert". A nostalgic tribute to creature features from the 1950's, It Came From The Desert features rival motocross heroes and heroines, kegger parties in the desert, secret underground military bases, romantic insecurities...and of course giant ants.
