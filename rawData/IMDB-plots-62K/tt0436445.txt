The (love) life of a man fed up with his work and life routine changes when he enlists into a tango dancing course.
The fifty years old Jean-Claude has a boring life, working in a notary office of his own and as court official evicting tenants or seizing properties, or spending the Sundays afternoons in the retirement home with his sour, rude and bitter father. When he has a minor heart problem, his doctor advises him to exercise, and Jean-Claude begins to have tango lessons in a studio in front of his office. He meets the charming forty and something years old Françoise, who is also having classes for her wedding party, and she recalls she was her neighbor in her childhood. They become close and love flourishes between them, changing their lives.
Jean-Claude is 51 and weary. Since his divorce he has been leading a lonely, cheerless life. His job does not help him. Indeed, as a "huissier de justice" his everyday task consists in bringing despair into the homes of those who can't pay their rent, announcing eviction and/or property seizure. His depressing Sunday afternoons are invariably spent in the retirement home of his old father, a sour, never-satisfied pain in the neck. A glimmer of hope could come from the dance studio across his office. This is a place specializing in tango lessons. One day, Jean-Claude decides to enroll. There, he meets charming young Françoise and both click. The trouble is that Françoise is about to marry.
