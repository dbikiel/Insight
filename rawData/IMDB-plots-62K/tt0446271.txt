Cheryl Birtwick is 16 years old, rich, and freshly orphaned. Having no home and no one left to care for her but a giant trust fund and a passel of attorneys, she is sent to live with Lane family. Tim Lane and his daughter in law and grandson live on a massive ranch with three horses. They are well loved in their small farming community, and treat everyone around them with love and respect. Tim even helps the other farmers around him by giving them the rights to some of his crops for very little money. The only problem is, Tim is also short on funds, as many of his neighbors are, and soon learns he may lose his home if he doesn't pay the bank $25,000. Cheryl learns that he needs money and does what she can to help her new family keep their home. In the meantime, Cheryl conquers her fear of horses and makes a strong bond with one of Tim's prize horses; Black Beauty.
