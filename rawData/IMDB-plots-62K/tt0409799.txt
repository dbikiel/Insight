Ben is an art college student in London, whose imagination runs wild as he works the late-night shift at the local supermarket. What do he and his colleagues do to pass the long, endless hours of the night?
Ben Willis is an art student who works the night shift several times a week at the Whitechapel Sainsbury's. He's clear about the arrangement: he trades his time for money - cashback, as he calls it. We meet his co-workers, Sharon, Barry, and Matt, and their supervisor, Jenkins. Ben's colleagues are good at wasting time, but Ben talks to us about how he makes his shift go faster: by imagining that time has stopped. We see this late-night world of drudgery through Ben's eyes, as time does indeed stop, and he can get out his sketch book.
Heartbroken and tortured by insomnia, Ben applies for a job at the supermarket explaining his view and experience of female beauty. In his imagination, he stops time and undresses female customers to capture their beauty on paper between the pranks of his male co-workers. Time passes and the girl at the cash register is seen to grow in beauty in Ben's eyes, giving him a chance to let go of the past and move forward in life.
The movie is about love, art, and supermarket co-workers and shows an interesting view of time and time stopping. The most obvious art in the movie might be the one of drawing, capturing beauty, but the real thread in the story is the path between one lost relation and the passionate flames of new love and the feelings it conquers.
