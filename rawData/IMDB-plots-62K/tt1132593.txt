The silent aftermath of a young woman's disaster is broken by her discovery of nature's old rhythms.
A brutal assault changes Mariekes life. She leaves her familiar city rhythms for the solitude of a delapidated house in an empty countryside. Her irrational fears on the frozen farm are a constant struggle. As springs' orchestra begins, her curiosity for new things that cover the cold rot of winter pull her out of the suffocating interior of her mind. Slowly she accepts the help of John, her neighbour, but as the seasons change so does she.
