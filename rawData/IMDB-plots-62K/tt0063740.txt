A melancholic, fetishistic gunfighter is drawn into a vengeful and tragic kidnapping plot by his widowed ex-lover.
The Rogers family are rich and powerful cattle and land owners. The Caine brothers - Ben, Thomas and Eli - rebel against them and steal a shipment of gold coins. The Rogers are used to settling their affairs personally and kill Ben, while the other two manage to escape, although their house is burned down. Maria, Ben's wife, has only one wish: to avenge her husband's death. Only one person will help her to achieve this end: Manuel, a lonely gunfighter who accepts to help her due to his past relationship with Maria and Ben. Manuel decides to kidnap Diana, the Rogers' beloved daughter, and Maria obliges her father and his three sons to humble themselves on Ben's grave and ask for forgiveness. However, both the Rogers and the Caines' plans for each other go awry... with tragic and deadly results.
