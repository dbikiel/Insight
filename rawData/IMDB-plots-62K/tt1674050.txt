Janek comes to Warsaw to become the godfather of his good old friend's baby. During the week before the ceremony the lives of Janek, Michal and his wife Magda change dramatically as the men's criminal past haunts them mercilessly.
Michal has got what he's always dreamt of: his own company, a beautiful wife named Magda, a newborn son. He chooses a good old friend, Janek, to be the godfather of his child. This is just the beginning of Michal's secret plan as soon he asks his friend to take an interest in his wife. At the beginning the plan works out, but it becomes increasingly difficult for Michal to come to terms with it. He knows his deeply hidden past will inevitably come back to him, and Janek will have to make a life-changing decision.
