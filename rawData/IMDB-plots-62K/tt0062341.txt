Tarzan is summoned to Brazil by an old friend to stop an evil tribal cult from destroying native villages and enslaving the survivors. The Lord of the Jungle is accompanied on his quest by a pretty blonde doctor, a boy and a grizzled sea captain.
Tarzan travels to South America at the request of his old friend, a Professor who believes an ancient cult is preying on the local native population. He soon dons his loincloth and with Cheetah and pet lion Baron travels up the Amazon river. He meets up with Captain Sam Bishop and his young ward Pepe and all of them are soon in the hunt for the Jaguar Men and their leader Barcuna. Tarzan rescues a pretty doctor, Ann Phillips, after her jungle hospital is burned to the ground. Together, they set off into the jungle to confront the cultists who are enslaving the local population.
In Brazil, Dr. Ann Philips is trying to inoculate the superstitious natives against an epidemic. The murderous Jaguar Men oppose the intrusion. The natives take heart when the riverboat captain's young helper Pepe volunteers for the first shot.
