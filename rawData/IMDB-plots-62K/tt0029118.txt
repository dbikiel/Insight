A gangster is jailed for ten years after his wife becomes pregnant. He becomes bitter when she divorces him and remarries.
Gangster Joe Krozac is in prison for ten years. Reporter Paul North is fired by his newspaper for writing articles sympathetic to Krozac's wife and young son. She divorces Krozac and marries North. When Korzac gets out he goes looking for his former wife and son.
Joe Krozac is a big shot mob kingpin with an ego to match his status in the underworld. Whenever his territory is encroached on, as with the Kile Brothers, he ruthlessness doesn't stop at murder. He returns from a European excursion with new wife Talya and becomes overjoyed when she announces she is pregnant, 'envisioning his son as the eventual heir apparent to his criminal empire. However, like Al Capone, Joe forgets to pay his taxes and finds himself doing ten years in Alcatraz. He made a lot of enemies as a hoodlum and penitentiary life takes its toll. When Talya becomes reluctant to bring their son with her on prison visits, Joe is infuriated and threatens her, resulting in their divorce. Talya and her new husband fear the day when Joe leaves prison as much as the surviving Kile brother anticipates it.
A tale of crime in the Prohibition era, introduced by the message: " The story starts in 1927 ... America is in the criminal chaos of a national mistake ... American communities throttled by men with a genius for ruthlessness, organised evil and vast, law-evading power. America, 1927."
