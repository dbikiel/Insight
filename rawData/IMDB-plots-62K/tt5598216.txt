Documentary filmmaker Jon Greenhalgh examines the life of Dave Schultz, a professional wrestler who was part of 'Team Foxcatcher', funded by multi-millionaire John du Pont.
Team Foxcatcher (2016) is a documentary about how John du Pont used his money supposedly to help the USA Olympic Wrestling Team by building expensive training facilities on his home property, called 'Foxcatcher'. Dave Schultz, the USA's most successful wrestler at the time, was among the closest friends of John du Pont, defending him when Du Pont's bizarre activities began to cause concern among those living on the 'Foxcatcher' estate. Eventually, Schultz's loyalty to John du Pont would cost him his life.
This documentary focuses exclusively on John du Pont, Dave Schultz and the events surrounding the rise and fall of 'Team Foxcatcher'. Full of breathtaking archival footage of Du Pont, Schultz, the team and their families filming themselves on the DuPont Training Farm or giving promotional media interviews, this film offers a unique opportunity to see what really happened. Unlike the dramatic feature Foxcatcher (2014) - which takes a lot of liberties with the facts, the events, the characters and their relationships - this documentary doesn't invent anything and tells the amazing real-life story using their own words and film footage. Dave Schultz' widow Nancy Schultz was a witness to the events and his murder and is interviewed, too.
