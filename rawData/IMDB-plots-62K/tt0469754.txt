An IT company hires an actor to serve as the company's president in order to help the business get sold to a cranky Icelander.
The owner of an IT firm wants to sell up. The trouble is that when he started his firm he invented a nonexistent company president to hide behind when unpopular steps needed taking. When potential purchasers insist on negotiating with the "Boss" face to face the owner has to take on a failed actor to play the part. The actor suddenly discovers he is a pawn in a game that goes on to sorely test his (lack of) moral fibre.
The Danish lawyer Ravn owns a technology company, called 'IT', that he founded with the money he borrowed from his six directors. However, he invented a fictitious and powerful president named "The Boss of It All" to cover the unpopular policies of the company with the employees. When he decides to sell up the company to the Icelandic entrepreneur Finnur, the buyer demands to negotiate directly with the president of IT. Ravn hires the unemployed actor Kristoffer, who is a fan of the actor Antonio Gambini, to perform the role of president of IT under a contract of confidentiality. As time progresses, Kristoffer gets close to, and emotionally involved with, the employees of IT. He finds out information about the employees.
