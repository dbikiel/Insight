For years Ravi Kumar is considered as the black sheep of the Kumar's family; is unemployed, does not have a stable future and gets himself involved in fights at the drop of a hat. In spite of these bad qualities there exists one good quality in him that is he is willing to fight against injustice so much that when a gangster is killed he is accused, charged and placed before the court. Ravi's parents and the witnesses know that he is innocent but unfortunately no one comes to testify in favor of him resulting in Ravi getting incarcerated.
Ravi Kumar is clearly the black sheep of the Kumar family, and has been so for years. He is unemployed, uncouth, and gets into fist fights and trouble all the time. And then a man is killed, and the evidence points towards Ravi, he gets arrested. Although there were witnesses to this murder, no one comes forward to testify in favor of Ravi. The Kumar family are aware of Ravi's innocence, but watch helplessly as Ravi awaits his sentence, which may send him to the gallows, as now only a miracle can save Ravi.
