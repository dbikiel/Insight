A woman travels back one year in time to the Christmas before her broken engagement and tries to repair what went wrong. She discovers that this is a challenging undertaking.
Last Christmas, Allie broke things off with her boyfriend, Cameron (Michael Muhney). Looking back, she regrets it and no longer believes in the magic of Christmas, but when she meets Ginny, a truly magical being, she gets the chance to relive last Christmas. Determined to make the relationship last this time, she pulls out all the stops but realizes, you can't always change the past and happiness may appear in the strangest places.
After meeting a woman named Ginny and telling her the story of her failed relationship, Ali wakes up to find herself sent back to that Christmas before her planned wedding. While she sets out to avoid the mistakes of her past, she learns that changing the course of history is no easy task.
Working trough Christmas, Cameron bumps into his clumsy ex, LA workaholic Alison 'Ali', with his present partner, who finds her an utter looser. Ali's bad luck continues, stumbling into an inhospitable diner where obnoxious imaginary friend Ginny asks her about a second chance to make up the Christmas Eve when she broke up over a proposal-misunderstanding with Cameron. The next morning, she wakes up at home, a year back, home with her parents who are no less excited about a rare visit from her ever-travelling brother Jason. During Christmas traditions, she meet charming neighbor Nick again, now a thriving contractor, whom she regarded a second brother rather then a great date. Gradually it becomes clear that Nick, Jason, Cam and Ali all have life options to consider.
