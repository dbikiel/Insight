A criminal mastermind known as the Crimson Ghost is out to steal a device called the Cyclotrode, which can short-circuit all electrical currents on the planet.
The Crimson Ghost---attired in black hood and cloak, skull mask and surgical gloves---skulks to an abandoned mansion and informs his henchmen, Louis Ashe (Clayton Moore) and Bain (Rex Lease),of his plans to seize the Cyclotrode, a device invented by Dr. Chambers (Kenne Duncan), that is designed to detect-and-repel atomic bomb attacks. The Crimson Ghost intends to use the Cyclotrode as an offensive weapon for sabotage and extortion via its ability to stop any electrically-controlled mechanism.
