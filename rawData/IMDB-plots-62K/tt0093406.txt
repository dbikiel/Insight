Fat middle aged 24/7 drunkard Les Patterson (Barry Humphries) represents Australia at the UN where his fart literally incinerates an Arab ambassador. Patterson is reassigned to the Middle East so he can be tortured to death by the country he insulted. Patterson's arrival disrupts a coup and he is spared. At a bar Patterson meets a bioweapons scientist who's developed a horrific disease for the KGB which plan to distribute it to the Pentagon via toilet seats. Patterson, though far too drunk to understand anything happening, teams up with Dame Edna (also Humphries)to save the world.
