A disbarred lawyer (Giancarlo Giannini) is working as a debt collector for his partner Sapo (Philippe Léotard). Escorting prostitute Milena (Raffaella Baracchi) impregnated by Sapo to an unnamed sea resort of grotesque, he encounters the ambitious young ringleader Molecola (François Negret) who has bought several old recreational sites in the environs to turn the town into an "Italian Las Vegas" but the hotel-bar named Snack Bar Budapest run by a man (Carlo Monni) and his family remains an obstacle. Molecola needs a lawyer to legitimize forceful evacuation of Snack Bar Budapest and the lawyer agrees. However, a murder he commits brings him at odds with Molecola.
