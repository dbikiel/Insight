A lonely young aristocrat in turn-of the century England stuggles to meet the approval of his over-bearing, class-conscious father while trying to please the selfish woman he loves.
Basil is the story of a sheltered, naive young aristocrat who finds a friend, John Mannion and through him meets Julia Sherwin. Basil falls in love with Julia, but she is below his class, and if his father finds out, he will be disinherited and sent away, as his older brother, Ralph was, when he unwisely did the same. How can Basil keep his love and his father's respect?
