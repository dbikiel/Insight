ZERO is an 0 sucking in a young deserter, a casino victim and three heroin brothers. That is a destiny, a mixture of objectives and desires of heroes. That is a lifestyle balancing on the edge - bullets, numbers and needles.
This "Tarantinoesque film with a Baltic twist" has three interweaving story lines intermingling with each other during one eventful day for its main protagonists. One concerns a once successful undertaker who's lost everything and more at the casino and is persuaded by a ruthless gang that he must repay what he's borrowed from them by midnight or else he's a dead man. Our second character, unable to keep his sexual longings under control, goes AWOL from the Army in search of his girlfriend to sate his appetite. The third storyline involves a gang of carjackers who are motivated solely by the need to feed their drug habit.On the day when the lives of these three collide, the odds against anything other than catastrophe breaking out are ZERO.
