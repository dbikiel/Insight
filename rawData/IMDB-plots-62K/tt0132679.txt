Beatles' "significance" pushed to the breaking point in this bizarre documentary that juxtaposes their songs (sung by a number of rock stars) with World War II newsreel footage. Helen Reddy sings "Fool On The Hill" while Hitler relaxes at Bertchtesgaden, and Rod Stewart husks "Get Back" while Nazi troops goose step.
Unpleasant bully Adolf (Adolf Hitler) plans to conquer the world using storm-troopers. Peace-loving chums Frank (Franklin Roosevelt), Winny (Winston Churchill) and Joe (Joseph Stalin) determine to stop him at all costs (72,778,700 lives). This they then do, as depicted by WWII newsreel footage and film clips. The unpleasantness is eased considerably by the music of The Beatles, performed (surprisingly well) by a series of excellent musicians. The Good Guys win, and a huge party is thrown to celebrate. Hooray!
