A horror movie star returns to his famous role after years in a mental institution. But the character seems to be committing murders independent of his will.
Horror movie actor Paul Toombes, famous for playing "Dr. Death," suffers a nervous breakdown before going to England to do a TV series. Cast and crew members start dying the way characters did in Toombes' old movies.
In Hollywood, the successful actor Paul Toombes performs the character Dr. Death in a franchise written by his friend Herbert Flay. When his fiancée is murdered the same way one of Dr. Death's victim, he has a nervous breakdown and is sent to a mental institution. Years later, he is recovered and Herbert invites him to move to London to shoot a TV series with Dr. Death. But the murders of Dr. Death restart and Paul is the Scotland Yard's prime suspect.
Paul Toombes made himself a Hollywood star by playing the role of Dr. Death in a series of successful horror films written by his friend, Herbert Flay. But now, after years in a mental institution following the murder of his fiancée, Ellen - a murder that many, and even he himself, believe he committed - he wants nothing to do with the homicidal character. Herbert, who is writing a new TV series about Dr. Death, persuades him to return to the role. Paul soon regrets the decision when the producer of the series turns out to be the former maker of porn movies in which Ellen starred. Worse, his new female lead is arrogant and incompetent. Meanwhile, he discovers that he is not the only guest in Herbert's home. There's also Faye, his former co-star, who has gone mad after being deformed in a car explosion. But none of this unpleasantness compares to the horror of Dr. Death himself. It seems the character has a will of his own - a will to commit murder.
