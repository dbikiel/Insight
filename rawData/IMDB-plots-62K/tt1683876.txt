A documentary depicting the life and work of the trappers of Bakhtia, a village in the heart of the Siberian Taiga, where daily life has changed little in over a century.
In the center of the story is the life of the indigenous people of the village Bakhtia at the river Yenisei in the Siberian Taiga. The camera follows the protagonists in the village over a period of a year. The natives, whose daily routines have barely changed over the last centuries, keep living their lives according to their own cultural traditions. The expressive pictures are accompanied by original sound bites quoting the villagers.
In vast pristine parts of Siberia's taiga (forest), life changed little over centuries, essentially remaining dependent on nature and the rhythm of the seasons. Some indigenous people of the village Bakhtia at the river Yenisei show how most aspects of daily/annual life are still passed on from father(-figure) to knave, such as logging and hunting, often using the same natural materials, with an occasional technological innovation, such as the chainsaw.
