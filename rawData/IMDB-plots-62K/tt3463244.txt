Veteran ambulance chaser Oscar gets 'bitten' by a dog and decides to make some cash by suing its owner. However, this turns out to be Armando, a penniless man just released from jail after 30 years for a crime he didn't commit, shunned by everyone except his dog. Oscar sees the potential of getting millions in compensation from the state, and the two fifty-somethings team up in search of clues along with the help of a friendly Barista who owns the a caf√©.
A shaggy dog becomes the unwitting trigger for the collision of two disordered and precarious human existences. Bitten by the animal, moody and louche lawyer Oscar (Sergio Castellitto) wants to profit from the incident by suing its unfortunate owner, Armando. When the conniving lawyer discovers that Armando is in fact fresh out of jail, where he served thirty years for a crime he didn't commit, the goal changes and the stakes are raised: why not instigate a lawsuit against the state and claim millions? Between them is Carmen, a barmaid with a sensitive soul who has a shared past with the one and perhaps a shared future with the other.
