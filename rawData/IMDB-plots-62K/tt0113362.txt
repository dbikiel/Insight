In a time of war and disease, a young officer gallantly tries to help a young woman find her husband.
In 1832, cholera ravages Provence (South of France). After several misadventures, Angelo, young Italian officer hunted by the Austrian secret police, meets Pauline de Theus, a young lady. After a second accidental meeting, both will start the search of Pauline's husband in a chaotic country.
Beautiful cinematography, beautiful actors, sets and landscapes. Directing a little suspect with some slapstick influences occasionally which seemed to be out of context ? The two heos travel back and forth across cholera infested France, never laying a hand on each other until the dying moments of the film.Le Hussard is an Italian master horseman and swordsman who has left his mother in Itlay to gather funds for the revolutions against Austria. Seems to be some time delays as the revolution was a little later, maybe he didn't collect as much as was necessary to form the governmant that the wealthy and educated Italians wished for. In the 1830's, Giuseppe Mazzini organized the La Giovine Italia, an organization which supported several failed insurrections in various parts of Italy. It was probably one of these and the film doesn't address them, having the action in France and essentially dwelling upon the actors and their relationship.
