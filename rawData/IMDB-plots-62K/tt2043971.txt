A wealthy individual is desperate to find a way to stay alive, as he is both old and terminally ill. When a company known as RPG offers him the chance to become young again in return for a large amount of money, he doesn't think twice.
In a future not too far away, Steve Battier, an elderly, terminally ill multi-millionaire, accepts the offer of a company - RPG - that in exchange for a high monetary sum, provides a very select group of client√®le the chance to be young again. For 10 hours, 10 millionaires from around the world, men and women of fame and power, are transferred to attractive and healthy younger bodies, to live in a world of temporary rejuvenation, in a game of real thrills, where every hour someone must die. After returning to the body of a man of 23 years, enjoying the pleasures of sex, and experiencing the adrenaline of violence and power over life and death, Steve is willing to do anything to stay young forever... But what we may have experienced is not always what appears to be.
