After being married an entire year, Jane thinks back on some of her and Tarzan's adventures as she searches for something special to mark the occasion with.
As Tarzan and Jane's one-year wedding anniversary approaches, Jane searches the jungle for the perfect gift for Tarzan, even enlisting the help of Terk and Tantor. As they recall the many adventures they've shared so far, Jane realizes what an exciting year it's been in the jungle from encounters with old friends, outsmarting panthers to surfing the lava down an erupting volcano. But all of that is nothing compared to the surprise that Tarzan has in store for Jane.
