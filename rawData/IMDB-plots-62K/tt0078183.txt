A communal drug family begins to dissolve from within while a University student watches and records it all.
Steve is the witty and energetic leader/guru of a quasi-family of artists-turned-drug addicts living together in a commune in Montreal. Bozo is a shy and naive McGill University sociology student who infiltrates the group, his motive being that he's writing his thesis on drug culture and is fascinated by Steve and his family. Bozo is very professional about his approach, but Steve regards him with bemused contempt. What Bozo observes is a group threatened from within and without. Steve is having doubts about his position as leader and Pierre and Peter have turned from cocaine to heroin. On top of that, a large cache of drugs is sitting in a locker at the Montreal Windsor Station, and the family are looking to retrieve it to make them rich and happy again. The problem is that the Police have surrounded the building and are closely watching it all times. Under this pressure Steve decides to back away, to the dismay of the rest of the group and Peter and Pierre decide amongst themselves to do something stupid...
