Han Dae-huei, a public official in charge of residential pollution of Mapo district. No one can disturb his composure: a man who never loses his temper: a man of tranquility; the apotheosis of snobbery. He is a typically unenthusiastic public official up to his bone. Never expect him to try a new thing or change anything.
