Deforestation of the Amazon is forcing indigenous Indians away, so few men can profit from cattle. Opposition gets killed. A US photojournalist tries to investigate. Activist Alyssa helps him.
In Bolivia's Amazon basin, corporate cattle ranches are replacing the rain forest. When Santos, charismatic leader of the union of rubber tappers, forges an alliance with Indians to protest deforestation, he is assassinated. O'Brien, a US photo-journalist who has no skills as an investigator, wants a story when he thinks the police have framed and murdered an innocent Indian as the assassin. In his search for the truth, he involves Lysa Rothman, who worked for Santos and with whom he falls in love. As he gets deeper into trouble with the cops and the real assassin, he not only needs Lysa's help but that of the Indians' leader. How many will die so O'Brien can get his story?
