Short movie Homage to the 15th anniversary, The Escape, is a short BMW film featuring the release of a new model series.
The Driver is back, this time in the employ of ruthless mercenaries charged with delivering a living human clone: a teenage girl that knows only about the world she sees for the first time from what she's read. Pursued by the FBI, this is a job The Driver will see through to his own decisive conclusion.
To evade a well-planned raid by the FBI at geneticist Dr Nora Phillips' covert bio-genetics facility, the stiff-lipped and ice-cool chauffeur known only as "The Driver", gets behind the wheel of a powerful 2016 BMW M5. His risky objective is to escort Lily--a precious specimen, and the last remaining human clone--to an undisclosed buyer, with the help of the elite task force of the hard mercenary, Holt; however, before long, things will take a turn for the unexpected. Can the Driver's legendary skills save Lily from an unknown fate?
