Cavalrymen disguised as civilians must drive a wagon train loaded with army rifles through dangerous Apache territory to Fort Collins.
Lt. Faraday has two wagons full of guns that he and his men must deliver. He also must escort two young ladies through hostile Indian Country. It is up to Running Horse to sabotage the wagons so that they will end up at Massacre Canyon where they will meet their fate.
Sergeant James Marlowe (Douglas Kennedy),in charge of an Army detail escorting a shipment of rifles to a Western Army post threatened by Apaches, travels in civilian attire with his men to avoid an attack. At a small outpost, the party is inadvertently exposed when Private "Peaceful" Allen (Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams),is recognized by Cora (Jeff Donnell). Joined by Cora, Flaxy (Audrey Totter) and Lieut. Richard Faraday (Philip Carey), is weakened by the loss of its water, and then is attacked by a large number of Apaches.
