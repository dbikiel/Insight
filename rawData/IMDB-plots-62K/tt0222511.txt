Cinderella is a poor girl suppressed by her evil stepmother and stepsisters. She dreams of dancing at the royal ball, and one day her dreams come true.
The heroes of the film were a grumpy stepmother, her two lazy and unsympathetic daughters, a weak-willed husband-forester and a stepdaughter-servant Cinderella. Cinderella using the fairy gets to the royal ball, where she meets a prince. Fairy magic disappears at midnight and Cinderella runs away, losing a glass slipper. And, as everyone knows, everything ends well.
