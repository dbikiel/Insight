Remake of 1941's "Ladies in Retirement" has Stella Stevens playing companion to wealthy, loony widow and she soon brings her brother and sister to live with them after they are released from an asylum for brutally murdering their parents years before. Now there appear to be skeletons that Stevens has worked so hard to keep hidden, ready to tumble out of her closet.
When they were only four and six-years-old, Ellen's younger brother and sister were found standing over the bloody corpses of their parents. Twelve years later, they are released from a juvenile mental institution into Ellen's custody. Unwilling to endanger her relationship with her fiancee or her position as a live-in assistant to his wealthy, eccentric stepmother, Ellen spins a precarious web of lies around her family's troubled past.
