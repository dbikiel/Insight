Brilliant sorority girl Cami's experiment in insect intelligence goes awry, leaving giant, mutant insects hunting for food in a sorority house - and the only thing to eat is beautiful sorority sisters! The insect horrors increase in size while their source of food shrinks. The girls fight a savage hit and run battle with whatever weapons they can find. But the insects have more on their super-intelligent minds than food. Beautiful Josi becomes a host for more than sorority parties when she is infected with the next generation of mutant insects! Cami and a few survivors survive the night, leaving insect carnage throughout the house. But to deal with a bug problem, you have to kill them ALL ...
A "creepy" bug-loving sorority girl experiments on insects trying to raise their intelligence. When an angry sorority sister grows tired of the bugs escaping, she sprays them all with insecticide. Instead of killing them, the bug spray mutates the genetically altered insects and arachnids, turning them into giant flesh eating monsters. And the only flesh nearby belongs to the sorority girls.
