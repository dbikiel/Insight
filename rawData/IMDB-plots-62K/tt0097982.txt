A professor and four graduate students journey to a crumbling mansion to investigate paranormal activity and must battle ghosts, aliens and satanic entities.
Grad students and their apparently unbalanced professor gather in a remote cabin to document some supernatural goings-on. Before long, people are going insane, hallucinations are popping up all over the place, and nobody's entirely sure what's real and what's not.
