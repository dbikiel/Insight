Vince would kill for a good grade...
After leading a jury to wrongly sentence a man, Abigail enters her new teaching job at the law school with a newfound commitment to ethics. When she takes over her new class, it includes Vance, an intensely ambitious student who will do anything for an A. When Abigail fails him for academic dishonesty, Vance threatens that he will stop at nothing to get what he wants. As Vance's devious plot begins to unravel, she must take her life into her own hands, or Vance will take it himself.
