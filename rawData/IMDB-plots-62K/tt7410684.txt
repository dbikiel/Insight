Comedian Ali Wong performs her live stand-up set at Toronto's Winter Garden Theatre.
Two years after giving birth to her daughter, a very pregnant Ali Wong returns in her second original stand-up comedy special, filmed at Toronto's Winter Garden Theatre. The always unapologetic and nasty first time mom gets real on why having kids is not all it's cracked up to be, including the challenges of breastfeeding, balancing family and career post pregnancy, and why all women deserve three years of paid maternity leave.
