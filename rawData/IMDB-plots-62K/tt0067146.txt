Nineteen year old Jimmy Graham has grown up to be an angry young man based on his experiences, including not having either his mother or father in his life as he was growing up. When he was six, Jimmy saw his mother, Ann Graham, die before his eyes, she killed by his father Harry Graham in a drunken rage. Jimmy's testimony helped put his father away. Jimmy's anger often manifests itself in passive-aggressive behavior. When Jimmy is rejected from joining the military due to medical reasons, he, at a loss, decides to search out Harry, who he knows has now been paroled. He finds Harry living in a trailer park in a community close to their old Pennsylvania home. Harry is also in a relationship with a woman named Jenny Benson, who also lives in the trailer park in a Winnebago. Jenny knows all about Harry's past. While Harry wants to be whatever Jimmy wants him to be in his life, Jimmy exhibits that passive-aggressiveness toward Harry, being generally cordial to him to his face while doing things behind his back intentionally to hurt him. Partly as Jimmy sticks around longer than he says and as their life is generally going better than expected, Harry, who seems to have owned up to his role in killing Ann, maps out a life for him and Jenny to include Jimmy if he wants. In the process, Jimmy will need to confront both his issues with his father, and the overall anger in his life which is hindering him from finding his own path.
After serving a prison term for killing his wife, a man is paroled and returns to his home town. He tries to re-establish his relationship with his now-grown son, who was a child when the incident happened--and who witnessed his father kill his mother.
