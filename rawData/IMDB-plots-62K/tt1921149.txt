Set in Brazil, three kids who make a discovery in a garbage dump soon find themselves running from the cops and trying to right a terrible wrong.
When two trash-picking boys from Rio's slums find a wallet in amongst the daily detritus of their local dump, little do they imagine that their lives are about to change forever. But when the local police show up, offering a handsome reward for the wallet's return, the boys, Rafael and Gardo, realize that what they've found must be important.

But when the local police show up, offering a handsome reward for the wallet's return, the boys, Rafael and Gardo, realize that what they've found must be important. Teaming up with their friend Rato, the trio begins an extraordinary adventure as they try to hang onto the wallet, evade the police, and uncover the secrets it contains. Along the way, the boys will have to figure out friend from foe, as they piece together the story of the wallet's owner Jos√© Angelo and realize they can't trust the police, led by the dangerous Frederico. But a pair of American missionaries working in their favela - the disillusioned Father Julliard and his young assistant Olivia - might just have the power to knock on the right doors.
