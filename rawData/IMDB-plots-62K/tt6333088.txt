Afghanistan, immediately post-9/11: Small teams of Green Berets arrive on a series of secret missions to overthrow the Taliban. What happens next is equal parts war-origin story and cautionary tale, illuminating the nature and impact of 15 years of constant combat with its unprecedented access to U.S. Special Forces.
Drawing on unprecedented access to U.S. Special Forces, LEGION explores the nature and impact of the nearly 15 years of constant combat since 2001 by focusing on the original foot soldiers in America's war on terror: the small teams of Green Berets sent on secret missions into Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban immediately following 9/11. Their story is both an epic, untold war story, set on a grand canvas, and a tragic cautionary tale about the origins of this never-ending war.
