Chicago Police Lieutenant Jim Brannigan is sent to the U.K. to escort organized crime boss Ben Larkin back to the U.S., but Larkin's hitmen prepare an ambush for Brannigan.
Jim Brannigan is sent to London to bring back an American mobster who is being held for extradition, but when he arrives, he has been kidnapped, which was set up by his lawyer. Brannigan, in his American Irish way, brings American law to the people of Scotland Yard in order to recapture this mobster with a price tag on his head and a stuffy old London cop with whom to contend.
Jim Brannigan is an American cop who's looking for Larkin, a criminal, but the man fled to London, so he is sent there to try and find him and bring him back. Brannigan works with a British inspector who cautions him about crossing the line, and before Brannigan can get Larkin, Larkin is kidnapped. So they work the case as a kidnapping, but Brannigan can't help but think this is a ploy for Larkin to escape. At the same time, a hitman Larkin hired to get Brannigan, is following him.
