Nobody Wants the Night is about the relentless icy landscape that separates and draws these two women together during the long, tense wait for the man they both love in such different ways.
Josephine (Binoche) travels to the hostile icy landscape of the remote North in search of her explorer husband. As winter descends and determined not to turn back she finds companionship with an Inuit woman (Kikuchi). With the elements against them and their survival reliant on each other it becomes clear they are waiting for a man they both love.
In 1908, in Greenland, the arrogant and bold Josephine Peary forces the experienced guides Bram Trevor and Ninq to pursuit the expedition of her husband Robert Peary that is looking for a route to the North Pole. Along their dangerous journey, Bram dies and Josephine and Ninq reach a support outpost to wait for Robert and meet the Eskimo girl Allaka that is living in an igloo. However, Ninq advises that they should return since the cold and long winter is coming and there is no chance to survive in the post. However Josephine decides to stay and soon she learns why Allaka is living on the spot.
