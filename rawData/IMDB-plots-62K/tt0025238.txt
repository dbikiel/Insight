A cocky guy joins the Navy for the wrong reason but finds romance and twice is cited for heroism.
To continue a grudge with naval officer Biff Martin, feisty construction worker Chesty O'Connor joins the navy and manages to get stationed on the same ship as Martin. Further complications arise when O'Connor starts dating Martin's sister, whom he meets while on shore leave.
It should be noted that "Here Comes The Navy" was filmed aboard the Battleship USS Arizona, in her 1930's refit configuration in which she would later be destroyed on December 7th 1941 at Pearl Harbor. A man from my home town died aboard her on that Day That Will Live in Infamy. But this is one more reason to check out this film - it's a look at the USS ARIZONA during her life, instead of hear death.
