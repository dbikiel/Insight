In a small community life is placid till Aimer commits suicide. The new pastor refuses to give Catholic burial to those who commit suicide so Aimer's family defies his authority by burying Aimer in the churchyard. Furious, the pastor refuses to administer the sacrament to anybody until Aimer's body is moved away. As a result, babies are not baptized, weddings are being delayed and the new dead don't receive the last rites.
