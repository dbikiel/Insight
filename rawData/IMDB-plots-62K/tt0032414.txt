Dr. James Kildare has just completed his internship at Blair General Hospital and is assigned to work with his mentor, Dr. Leonard Gillespie. But fearing for the health of his father, Dr. Stephen Kildare, he returns to his parents home to help him with his excessive workload. Dr. Kildaire Sr. is servicing a wide area ever since the doctors in neighboring towns moved elsewhere. Noting that three doctors at Blair General are doing menial jobs because they can't start their own practices, Kildare conceives the idea of building a clinic in Parkersville to be serviced by the three doctors and financed by the townsfolk paying ten cents a week to subscribe to the service. But influential men in Parkersville provide serious opposition to the plan.
It's a happy day for Dr. Jimmy Kildare when he successfully completes his internship and is one of the lucky few who also obtains a staff position at the hospital. His mother's somewhat subdued response to his good news leads him to go home where he finds that she is terribly worried about his father, Dr. Stephen Kildare. He is overworked following the departure of a doctor in a nearby town and Jimmy decides to stay on for a few weeks to help him out, much to the consternation of Dr. Leonard Gillespie who was expecting him back at Blair General Hospital to take up his new duties. Kildare comes up with a scheme to have community pay a small amount every week for guaranteed medical service. He recruits unemployed doctors for the job but the townsfolk aren't keen on the idea.
