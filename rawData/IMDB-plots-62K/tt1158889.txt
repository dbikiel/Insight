A soldier returning from war is hired by her own father to drive his prostitutes around town. She calls upon herself to help one of them.
Lotte is a soldier recently back from war. She drinks, and her apartment is a mess. When her father comes to see her he offers her a job. He turns out to make his living by offering the services of African prostitutes to those who want to buy. Lotte starts driving his girlfriend and main attraction Lily around town for house calls. Lotte determines that Lily needs her help.
Bristling with repressed rage, a female war veteran drinks to excess to numb her fury. After returning to her provincial Danish hometown, she becomes involved with her sleazy fathers brothel business. For their fourth feature together, director Annette K. Olesen and screenwriter Kim Fupz Aakeson combine two timely social issuesdisturbed former soldiers and prostitutionwith a troubled father-daughter relationship drama. Raised by her grandparents after her mother died, tough, mannish-looking Lotte (Trine Dyrholm, Denmarks biggest female star) clearly has unresolved issues with her unreliable father Kurt, and still longs for his approval and affection. Needing money after abruptly leaving the Danish armed forces in Afghanistan, Lotte asks her dad for a loan. Instead, he offers her work as a driver, and she winds up as chauffeur and protector for Kurts gorgeous mistress Lily, one of the Nigerian prostitutes he pimps as a side to his legitimate trucking business. Although Lotte initially displays jealousy over the attention Kurt showers on ultra-feminine Lily, she soon discovers that Lilys looks and attitude serve as a defensive cover not so different from the fa√ßade Lotte had to assume while in the army. Ultimately, the two little soldiers form an uneasy bond. [D-Man2010]
