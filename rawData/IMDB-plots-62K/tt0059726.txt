On a college ski weekend, Todd and Craig pretend to be Jane and Nora, a pair of English girls. Their reasons? To meet girls, and to learn to ski. Along the way, Lesley Gore shows up on the bus to sing "Sunshine, Lollipops, and Rainbows", and James Brown and the Famous Flames appear at the lodge to sing "I Feel Good".
