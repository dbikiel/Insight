Aspiring young DJ Tolik and world-renowned cellist Vladimir Chizhov meet a barefoot man on a busy Moscow street. They press a button on a peculiar apparatus and teleport to the desert planet Pluke... The animated remake of the cult feature film Kin-dza-dza tells the story of the adventures of Tolik and Uncle Vova in way that is every bit as quirky and exciting. In the dune world of Pluke, people fall into two categories - Patsaks and Chatlanians. An ordinary match is the most precious valuable, and people are judged by the color of their pants.
