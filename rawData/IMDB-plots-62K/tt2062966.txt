King Kelly is the online username of Kelly, a young girl from Long Island, NY who dreams of becoming famous through her webcam strip tease show. Obsessed with the prospect of celebrity, Kelly stops at nothing to get what she wants.
King Kelly is an aspiring internet star who performs webcam stripteases. When Kelly's car - filled with illegal narcotics that she must deliver - is stolen by her bitter ex-boyfriend on the 4th of July, Kelly and her best friend Jordan embark on an epic whirlwind of drugs, sex, violence and mischief-making as Kelly tries to reclaim what's hers. Kelly's biggest online fan, a wayward State Trooper, joins the journey as the night spirals into chaos. Made entirely from camera-phone footage, King Kelly is a sensational journey through hedonistic American youth culture and the YouTube generation.
