Norah is very rich, owns her own shipyard and has Sylvia double for her at all outside functions. But Sylvia is now married and wants to go to Washington with her new husband while Norah's latest fiance has dumped her. Determined not to make money an issue, she invites all the officers to her house for tea and has Sylvia again play Norah. She is looking for the right man who will want her and not her money and she thinks that she has found that man in Captain Travis. The only problem is that Travis is interested in the Norah double because of her millions. So Norah waits to see if he will propose to her for herself instead of proposing to Sylvia for the money.
