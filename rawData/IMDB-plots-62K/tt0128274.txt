A pair of comical soldiers (Robert Ball and Frankie Ray) investigate a mysterious crater in an atomic detonation area and discover several beautiful alien vixens (Dolores Reed and Gloria Victor) who plan to conquer the world using an army of vegetable monsters.
Slacker Army privates Penn (Frankie Ray) and Philbrick (Robert Ball) are on maneuvers with their squadron when curiosity possesses them to investigate a mysterious atomic crater where they discover strange vegetable creatures (a la The Thing). When they investigate further they discover that the monsters are commanded by an alien called Dr. Puna (Dolores Reed) who resembles an over-sized earthling woman. Puna and Prof. Tanga (Gloria Victor) find the earthling soldiers ripe for scientific study, and Penn and Philbrick are powerless to escape. Puna has extra-sensory powers like the ability to send strange electric shocks through the earth soldiers, as well as a ray gun that emits terrifying feelings in the men. Rationalizing that their basic male-ness may be their only way of getting on equal footing with the female aliens, Penn and Philbrick give in to their basic sexual attraction for the women-like aliens and find that there is a way to bond with the creatures and possibly make a better life for mankind.
