Dramatized telling of the story of Katsushika Oei, daughter of the great Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849). A great artist in her own right, but never satisfied with her own skills, she nurses her father after a stroke and worked closely with him for nearly 20 years. The show also features the star visiting London to see an exhibition at the British Museum called Hokusai: Beyond the Wave, which also featured works by Oei.
