During the Depression, a con-man promises rain to a desperate drought-ridden Kansas town and marriage to a local desperate spinster.
Lizzie Curry is on the verge of becoming a hopeless old maid. Her wit and intelligence and skills as a homemaker can't make up for the fact that she's just plain plain. Even the town sheriff, File, for whom she harbors a secret yen, won't take a chance --- until the town suffers a drought and into the lives of Lizzie and her brothers and father comes one Bill Starbuck - profession: Rainmaker.
This is the story of a family...and the daughter specifically who both feel hopeless about two things. The family is concerned about the drought that is effecting the family farm, and about the future of their sister Lizzie. Since she hasn't met a man at her stage of life...the family and she thinks it's because she's too "plain" looking. Until a stranger comes along an convinces both that there is hope.
