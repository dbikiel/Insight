A documentary that follows an Alaskan bear family as its young cubs are taught life's most important lessons.
In an epic story of breathtaking scale, Disneynature's new True Life Adventure "Bears" showcases a year in the life of a bear family as two impressionable young cubs are taught life's most important lessons. Set against a majestic Alaskan backdrop teeming with life, their journey begins as winter comes to an end and the bears emerge from hibernation to face the bitter cold. The world outside is exciting-but risky-as the cubs' playful descent down the mountain carries with it a looming threat of avalanches. As the season changes from spring to summer, the brown bears must work hard to find food-ultimately feasting at a plentiful salmon run-while staying safe from rival male bears and predators, including an ever-present wolf. "Bears" captures the fast-moving action and suspense of life in one of the planet's last great wildernesses-Alaska!
The documentary follows a fiercely protective mama bear named Sky and her two young cubs, Amber and Scout, over the course of an entire year. Narrated by John C. Reilly, the film trails this young family as they venture down a mountain in search of sustenance, and encounter a variety of threats, including a pair of imposing male bears named Magnus and Chinook, as well as a crafty -- and very hungry -- wolf named Tikani. As the seasons shift, Sky teaches Amber and Scout the secrets to recognizing danger and foraging for food. Later, as salmon appear in the local waters, Sky attempts to build her fat reserves for the coming winter. But it won't be easy, because challenges await over every summit, and the competition for food can be fierce..
