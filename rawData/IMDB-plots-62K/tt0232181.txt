A fine panoramic view of this busy market on a Friday morning. Immense throngs of people are passing along the stands and making their purchases of fish. A great character-study. - from the Edison Catalog
From an overhead angle, the camera shows a view of an outdoor fish market in a New York City street. The camera slowly pans along the street, showing several different sellers dealing with their customers, as well as numerous passers-by on the busy street.
