Ramses, a somewhat shy 20-year old boy living in a communal cult, gets permission to leave to visit his dying father.
Ramses is a somewhat shy 20-year old boy who has been living in a rural commune under sect-like conditions for 8 years. With piercings all over his body and dressed in robes, he has been studying the teachings of Kahn-Goeroe. When he is about to undergo a rather painful initiation rite, his sister Natasha visits and tells him their father is sick and dying. Ramses receives permission to leave, and together they head for Amsterdam. Once outside the commune, Ramses who isn't used to making his own decisions, learns about love and he meets a Palestinian prophet who is expecting the Messiah to land on the roof of his flat on the outskirts of Amsterdam.
