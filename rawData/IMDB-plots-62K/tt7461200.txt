In a politically divided America, a man struggles to make it through the Thanksgiving holiday without destroying his family.
Chris (Ike Barinholtz) and Kai (Tiffany Haddish) agree not to sign an oath of loyalty to the United States for tax incentives. The deadline is Black Friday and a politically-charged Chris focuses on getting through the holiday with his family while he pours over the news regarding The Oath. The day after Thanksgiving, he and his family are surprised when agents show up to interrogate him. As the situation escalates, they must decide how to stay out of jail and protect their family.
