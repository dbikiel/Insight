DCP Anant Shrivastav, along with his team Shekhar Sachdev and Ashwin Gupte, have been assigned to escort dangerous terrorist and ISI agent Iqbal Ansari from Chandigarh to Mumbai. But there is an unseen enemy who does not want this group to reach Mumbai.
It started as a routine mission to escort hardened terrorist and ISI agent Iqbal Ansari from Chandanghad to Mumbai. It ended as a nightmare. The first escort team of police officers was ambushed midway, blown to bits. But a brave officer managed to ensure that Ansari did not escape. Now another team was being sent to do this job from Mumbai. DCP Anant Shrivastav "The Professor". A Police officer in the winter of his career, a failure in the establishment's eyes and more important, in his own. Now on the eve of his daughter's wedding, Shrivastav was being given this crucial assignment. This was his one last chance to do something. Make a difference. Sr. Inspector Shekhar Sachdev. Street-smart, brave, but rotten to the core. He didn't want part of any suicide mission, but he had no choice. Forced on the mission, he made his own agenda. Sub Inspector Ashwin Gupte. A young middle class rookie office on his first serious assignment, full of ambitions, hopes, values, good intentions. He was going to find out the hard way that there was a massive difference between training school and the ground reality of the harsh, corrupt and violent world out there. Three officers accompanied by two constables, now given the charge of escorting a dreaded terrorist, and a crucial witness in the case against him, from Chandanghad to Mumbai. A group of men all fighting their own demons who were going to confront some very, very real ones. Because someone out there didn't want them to get to Mumbai. A nameless, faceless enemy who lurked in the shadows, who was always one step ahead of them. An enemy who would do all he could to stop them. Whatever it took. A three day assignment would become a never-ending nightmare. An overnight journey would become a journey into a dark world of brutality, corruption, conspiracies and terror, a journey into fear. Where nothing was as it seemed, everyone was for sale and no one could be trusted.
