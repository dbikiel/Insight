Near the remote East Cape the matriarch lives in her very basic dwelling with real fire in the hearth, where she cooks. We get an insight in the whanau in this saga, where troubles are met with kindmess, except by the pakeha or those that have gone across to their side. The first movie directed by a Maori woman with so much warmth and authenticity. Wait for the sweeping finale!
