Heads roll as two cops, Chuck and Andy, go against Mr. D'Angelo, the biggest drug dealer in Florida, and his ruthless enforcer Fred, who has no legs but does have two mean double barrel shotguns built into his wheelchair.
In 1970s Florida, crime boss D'Angelo is smuggling and distributing drugs concealed inside cigars and inside sacks of loose tobacco leaves. His top enforcer is Lou aka 'Mr. No Legs'. Lou has lost his legs in an accident and uses a wheelchair to get around. However, he is a dangerous man due to his fighting abilities and a pair of shotguns built into his wheelchair armrests. Among the people working for the organization is student Ken Wilson who needs money to pay for his tuition. During a domestic fight with his girlfriend Tina, Ken accidentally kills her. In panic his solicits the aid of the crime outfit he's working for. The outfit sends two men to take Tina's body and make it look as if she overdosed. But they kill Ken, fearing that Tina's disappearance would attract the police's attention to Ken and eventually to their organization. Nevertheless, Tina's 'overdose death' is investigated by the police. Tina's brother, Andy, is a drug squad detective. After he is informed of his sister's death, Andy and his partner Chuck, who knew Tina wasn't into drugs, start an investigation of their own. As they put the pieces of the puzzle together, the two detectives get closer to D'Angelo's drug operation, to his 'Mr. No Legs' top enforcer and to a mysterious 'dirty cop' working inside their police department.
