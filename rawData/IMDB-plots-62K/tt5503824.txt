It's the day after Halloween. Jacopo and Duke wake up in the apartment of two girls: Lenka, the Czech Republic, and Elizabeth, English, both in Italy thanks to the Erasmus project. The dawn of that new day brings with it a big problem: Elizabeth died. But there's more, because none of the three remember what happened. Neither James nor Duke nor Lenka, remember what happened that night.
