Football player Bob Miller, played by an actual football player, is lost in the jungle. Who else to find him but Jungle Jim.
After Jungle Jim rescues Anne Lawrence from deadly rapids, he learns that she is looking for one-time football hero Bob Miller who disappeared 9 years before when his military flight disappeared over the jungle. There are problems in the area and tribes are being attacked and enslaved by the Skeleton Men. They learn that a white man with a gun is leading the Skeleton Men and Anne fears that it might be Miller. The tribesmen are being put into forced labor in a mine and Jim sets out to rescue them. Along the way they will meet strange creatures and eventually be taken prisoner themselves. Jim finds a way out.
Anne Lawrence (Sheila Ryan) is an America free-lance photographer who has been hired by a wealthy American. She has been hired to find the man's nephew, Bob Miller (Robert Waterfield), a former All-American football player and a world-war- two pilot , who was lost while piloting a bomber while on a routine mission over Africa. She meets Jungle Jim (Johnny Weissmuller) who agrees to help her in the search. Complications rise quickly in the form of a savage, hostile native tribe attacking and burning other villages, and led by DR. Mitchell Heller (Lyle Talbot), a white scientist who is capturing natives from other tribes to work for him, as slave labor, in a synthetic-diamond scheme. Jim finds Bob living happily with a friendly native tribe whom he has started to educate in civilized living. He joins Jim and Anne and the friendly natives in a hunt for Heller.
