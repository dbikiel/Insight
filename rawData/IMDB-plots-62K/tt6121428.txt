Arata Kaizaki is 27 years-old and unemployed. He quit his prior job after working for the company for 3 months. Arata Kaizaki decides to take part in a research program "ReLIFE." He takes medication that makes him look 10 years younger and he is to attend high school for a year. There, he falls in love with female high school student Chizuru Hishiro.
He is going to be thirty-years-old soon and is unhappy and wholly dissatisfied with his life. He wants a re-do and gets his wish when he is transported to life as a teenager going through high school. He cherishes his moments and experiences this time and enjoys the activities, the field trips and the class-mates. There is the high school crush too, but he knows that it all just cannot last. He will return to his own age at the end of the year.
