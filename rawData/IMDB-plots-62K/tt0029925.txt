Socially prominent Michael Ashburn, is the chief assistant to Rufus Trent, wealthy London loan broker. He has allowed himself to become engaged to the Rufus' daughter, Roberta, the match engineered primarily by socially-ambitious Mrs. Trent. As Michael is closing the shop in the late afternoon, a man named Douglas takes out a large loan, using his niece's (Julie Evans) earring as a deposit. He scurries right off with the money but, to his dismay, Michael finds that the earrings are fastened to Julie's ears and can not be removed. Much to his socially-prominent position he is very disgusted as he must now keep a guard of her. Soon, he finds himself in jail and Julie has his flat keys. Julie spends the night in his flat, and Michael gets out of jail in time to hurry home where Julie is just leaving. His fianc√©e Roberta shows up, and Roberta isn't thrilled to find another woman leaving Michael's apartment early in the morning, so the engagement is broken. This delights her father. Actually, it kind of delights Michael but he is a gentleman and wouldn't say so. Could all of this have been a planned scheme by some party unknown?
