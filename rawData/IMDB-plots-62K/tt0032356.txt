Early in World War II, Danish sea captain Andersen, delayed in a British port, tangles with German spies.
This is the tale of life in a British port in the first year of World War II. Spies and smugglers abound in the blackout and unreal shore life of the "phoney war" (before the shooting started).
Danish freighter captain Andersen, unwillingly delayed for inspection by a British warship, wangles British shore passes for himself and his first officer...only to have them stolen by mysterious passengers "Mrs. Sorensen" and "Mr. Pidgeon." Unwilling to be taken advantage of, Andersen follows his strayed passengers ashore, and soon is caught up through one crowded night in the machinations of a German spy ring.
