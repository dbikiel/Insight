A teenager pursues his childhood dream of becoming the best at reverse running.
Named after the alternative athletic 'skill' where contestants run backwards into cult-hero 'glory', this big-hearted, small-town comedy centres on 'Kid' Campbell (Dan Cannon) and his dream to emulate his hero, reverse-running legend John Jones (Steve Moneghetti). Under the guidance of the passionate but luckless Coach Leroy (Rosco Brauer), Kid endeavours to overcome his arch-rival Stephen 'SJ' James (Julian Shaw), a bitter father (Daryl Cannon) who was robbed of his own sporting dream to become a champion kite-flyer, and the memory of a final race-day embarrassment which saw him disqualified for turning his shoulders 25 percent (making his reverse run into a sideways one).
