Where do you find love? Sometimes all you need is a sign.
'SIGNS' romantic short film. This 12 minutes speechless film is about a lonely boy who start communicating with a cute girl in next building using written signs and eventually they met each other. Love doesn't always talk, sometimes might be expressed even from a piece of paper. In a world of social networking and cellphone, signs are still powerful as long as they mean a lot.
This is a story about a man who is indecisive, very shy and lonely. He has no friends or mates in the city he is in. But one day, he accidentally meets a girl who works in the building across his. She connects with him in another way, with signs and through them, his character undergoes a dramatic change in his favor.
All alone in a bustling metropolis buzzing with life and crammed with people, a timid young man prepares himself for yet another dull day at the office. Buried under tons of papers and tedious assignments, the young loner will see a ray of hope shine when at the neighbouring building, an intriguingly beautiful woman starts exchanging swift and nervous glances with him. But who could she be? In the end, can a single sign be the prelude to a great love?
