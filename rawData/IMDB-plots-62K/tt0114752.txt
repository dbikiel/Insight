When bumbling look-alike criminal brothers Zike and Spider, kidnap best friends Katie and Tyler, the two girls must use their smarts and few booby traps to try and escape their captors. But not without the help from a pony named Two-Bits and a horse named Pepper -- who must come to the girls' rescue.
Comedy about idiotic (the two can't even add 1+1) kidnappers, both played for unknown reasons by Joe Piscopo, who capture two young girls and hold them for ransom. However, in "Home Alone" fashion, the two girls make fools of the two men. The film becomes even sillier as two horses who talk to one another decide to rescue the girls from the kidnappers.
