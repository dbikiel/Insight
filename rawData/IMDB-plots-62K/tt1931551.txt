In 1943, five US soldiers are recruited by the OSS for a time travel mission to save the world from the tyranny of Hitler's 25th Reich.
Introducing a crazy new genre mash-up from Australian director, Stephen Amis. A WWII sci-fi adventure - full of time-travel, duplicitous Nazi robots, faulty spaceships and giant mega-fauna... Based on the classic novella, 50,000 Years Until Tomorrow by J.J. Solomon, and with a screenplay penned by Amis, David Richardson and Serge DeNardo, the movie is a homage to sci-fi and WWII movies of the 1940's and 50's.
In 1943, during the devastating World War II, a brave team of five American soldiers led by Sergeant Carl Weaver, is entrusted with the task of capturing a pair of wild black pumas in the Australian outback. Instead, the GIs will soon find themselves 50.000 years back into the past, in search of a secret that may end the war with the evil Nazis. Can the band of soldiers prevent an unimaginable and dreadful future?
