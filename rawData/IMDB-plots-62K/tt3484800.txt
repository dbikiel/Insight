A young family moves to an isolated house which the wife has been hired to restore, only to discover that the previous owner is reputed to have murdered his wife.
The Hamilton family move into a large country house on the Yorkshire Moors to supervise its restoration from a dilapidated B&amp;B to the original Victorian grandeur. When Meg Hamilton, wife, mother and renovation expert first loses her London team after an accident, then a local Yorkshire team too superstitious to continue, she's forced to carry on alone. The discovery of a secret attic room, a Rosicrucian mosaic, a bricked up root cellar and many other unexplainable events gradually convince Meg, her husband Alec and children Penny and Harper, that they're not only restoring the house, but also its original Victorian owners who died 150 years ago. But before they can escape, the house - and its former occupants - force them to spend one last, terrifying night under its roof.
Artist Alec Hamilton, his wife Meg and their children Penny and Harper move into the bleak and isolated Radcliffe Hall in Yorkshire, which Meg is refurbishing for an American client. Penny believes she sees a ghost in one of Meg's photos of the house and later claims that a ghostly young woman tried to get into bed with her. Uncovering what they believe is a satanic altar on which Radcliffe allegedly killed his wife in 1845 before drowning himself causes the workmen to quit and Penny brings in psychic Nigel Lean, who tells them that Radcliffe's presence is very strong in the house. Meg is sceptical until she too sees a ghost and senses that Alec, who cut his hand which now bleeds for no reason, is being taken over by the ghost of Radcliffe. As night falls she prepares to take the children and flee but first must overcome Alec, who seems determined that history should repeat itself with Meg being sacrificed on the altar.
