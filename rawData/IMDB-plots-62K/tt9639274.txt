It's about an Italian young man, whose parents are from Bangladesh. He lives with his mom, dad and sister in a house in Rome. He works in a museum, and in his free time, performs with his band at small events. He is still trying to figure out life, but one day an Italian girl appears in his life.
The lead character - and the director - is a second-generation immigrant from Bangladesh, born in Rome, Italy and an Italian citizen. His Bangla friends and himself speak so deeply the local language they could have been Romans for generations. But life isn't simple, juggling a job as a Museum warden, a family adhering to cultural traditions, a religion with strict principles, and a brand-new girlfriend. In the end, it's a witty romantic comedy.
