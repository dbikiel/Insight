Three college students base their class project around gossip and how fast it spreads, which soon spirals out of control.
On a beautiful college campus, something ugly is about to be spread around. A bit of gossip that was told is starting to take a frightening turn. Who could it have offended and how far will the person on the other side of the gossip handle the embarrassing situation.
Derrick, Cathy, and Travis, three students and fellow roommates, decide to do a class project on gossip. Derrick witnesses couple Naomi and Beau making out at a night club, but then she passes out and Beau leaves. Cathy spreads the rumor that well-known ice princess Naomi had sex with Beau at the club that night, which quickly evolves until the gossip mill is saying that Beau went ahead and had sex with Naomi after she passed out. Cathy has regrets when Naomi cries rape and Beau is being arrested.
