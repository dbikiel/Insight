In Cambodia, the police arrests the gangster Playboy since they believe he is the leader of the Butterfly gang. However Playboy is only responsible for laundering the money and other crimes and accepts a plea bargain to disclose the name of the true kingpin. The local police officers Dara, Tharoth and Sucheat and the French officer Jean-Paul, who is visiting the Cambodia, are assigned to escort Playboy to the maximum security prison. Meanwhile, the mobster Madame Butterfly, who is the true boss, puts a bounty on Playboy. The officers deliver Playboy and when they are leaving the prison, there is a riot and the inmates escape from their cells. Now the officers and the security guard that is guiding them have to fight to survive.
