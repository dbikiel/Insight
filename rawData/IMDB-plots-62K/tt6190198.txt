Hibiki is an awkward, 17-year-old high school sophomore who hasn't known romance. But she's about to fall in love for the very first time. With whom? A man who isn't great with words, but compassionate about his students. It's her history teacher, Mr. Ito. "Is it okay if I fall for you?" Hibiki asks. "I'm afraid I can't return those feelings," is Ito's reply. Hibiki's first love crashes before takeoff. But it doesn't matter. "Still I want to cherish my crush anyway." A teacher's heart begins to turn by a student's pure love.
