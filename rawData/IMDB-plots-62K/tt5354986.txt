In 2001 a mass grave was discovered in a suburb of Belgrade. Soon there were more to come. "Depth Two" investigates the hidden story behind this horrid discovery and takes us back to 1999 and the NATO bombings in Serbia.
A combination of spoken testimonies and images of the places where the crimes happened 17 years ago, DEPTH TWO is a thriller documentary about a mass grave in the suburbs of Belgrade. In an attempt to uncover, shed a light on and give a voice to these stories, intentionally buried in silence, the film speaks directly to the sensations, imagination and emotions of the viewer, in a meditative and hypnotic way.
