A documentary about the rise and fall of fascism and the effects of Nazism on German society.
The film uses captured trophy chronicles from the film archives of the Ministry of Propaganda of Nazi Germany (Third Reich) and Hitler's personal photo archive, as well as numerous amateur photographs discovered by the SS men. Romm, a direct follower of Eisenstein, Vertov, Pudovkin, in this film masterfully uses expressive means of editing, musical design, journalistic speech to characterize the Nazi regime. It is due to the counterpoint of chronicles, voiceover and music that the film has such a strong emotional impact on the viewer.
