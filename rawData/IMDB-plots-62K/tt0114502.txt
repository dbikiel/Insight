Sophie "inherits" her uncle's preserved whale and finds out that whoever sleeps in the whale's belly with her will be granted one wish. That causes chaos and hatred in the village.
A huge stuffed whale, part of a traveling show, arrives on a truck in a little Austrian village. Calamitously, its owner, Ricardo, dies. The orphaned object, temporarily parked in town, provokes a chain of events by turns homely, fantastical, sensual, and comic.
Roberto, a showman, has spent his whole life travelling the country with his preserved whale, showing this strange creature to his audiences. His last journey takes him towards a tiny village in the mountains, but he suffers a fatal heart attack before reaching his destination. The mayor manages to find a relative of Roberto's, Sophie Moor, who comes to 'inherit' this enigmatic legacy. It eventually transpires that the whale has magic powers: whoever sleeps in the whale's belly with its owner, Sophie, will be granted one wish. This has complicated consequences: a runaway bride who returns, her transformation into a dog, and other unexpected events.
