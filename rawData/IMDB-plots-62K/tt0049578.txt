Shortly after their tenth wedding anniversary, New York City Theater Producer Steven Hilliard (Leslie Nielsen) and his wife, former popular radio singer Kay Ashley Hilliard (June Allyson), are getting a Kay-initiated Reno divorce after Kay finds out about a marital indiscretion he had with Crystal Allen (Dame Joan Collins), a gold digging chorus girl in one of his shows. News of the indiscretion made its way to Kay indirectly by her catty friend, Sylvia Fowler (Dolores Gray). In Kay getting the divorce, Kay's best friend, playwright Amanda Penrose (Ann Sheridan) believes Kay is playing right into the wants of Crystal, whose main goal is not to be happily married to Steven, but to get what such a marriage can bring to her in material wealth and comfort. Amanda does not believe Steven loves Crystal and that he still really does love Kay. And Kay does proceed with the divorce despite believing theirs was a happy and loving marriage before she learned of the indiscretion, and despite having an adolescent daughter, Debbie (Sandy Descher), to consider. But when Kay learns some information of the goings-on within her social circle, she decides to take back control of her married status while exacting a little revenge.
Kay Hilliard (June Allyson), a former nightclub singer, married ten years and mother of a young daughter, is informed that her husband Steven (Leslie Nielsen) is having an affair with chorus girl Crystal Allen (Dame Joan Collins), so she goes to Reno for a divorce. After that, Steven marries Crystal, but Crystal isn't true. When Kay hears about this, she starts fighting to win her ex-husband back.
