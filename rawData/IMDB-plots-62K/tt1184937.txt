A household gardener is outside watering the garden. Unknown to him, the son of another servant sneaks up behind him and steps on the hose, stopping the flow of water. The befuddled gardener doesn't know what happened to the water flow, putting the hose nozzle up to his face to investigate. The boy then steps off the hose, resulting in the gardener getting sprayed in the face with water. The boy ends up getting his comeuppance.
