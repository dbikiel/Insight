The Great Alone is a feature length independent documentary film that tells the inspiring comeback story of Iditarod Champion Lance Mackey.
Billed as 'The Last Great Race on Earth', the Iditarod Trail is the toughest dog sled race in the world. Snaking through over a thousand miles of the Arctic's harshest wilderness, the race is one of Alaska's proudest traditions and Lance Mackey is its greatest champion. He's a man with dog sled racing hard wired into his family, across generations. And he's a man who has battled homelessness, addiction and cancer, but who has always returned to the sled.
