A dragon known as Drago tries to end the rivalry between a brother and sister, both having dragon-like powers, who are after the throne of their grandfather, while a new threat steals Drago's source of power.
Sir Patrick Stewart voices Drago, the magnificent dragon who became bonded with King Gareth. When the King dies, his potential heirs, twin grandchildren who possess the dragon's unique strengths, use their inherited powers against each other to vie for the throne. When Drago's source of power, known as the "Heartfire", is stolen, more than the throne is at stake. The siblings must end their rivalry with swords and sorcery, or the kingdom may fall.
