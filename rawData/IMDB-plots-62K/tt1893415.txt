It's the weekend, and the lads are off on the town! What could possibly go wrong? How about the end of the world as we know it. 'Something' has happened, the undead are out in force, roaming the streets and devouring all who get in their way. Several groups of unlikely people find themselves trapped together in an emergency rescue centre, but no rescue is coming! So as the country goes to hell overnight, and the reality sinks in, how and what will these people do to survive.
The Zombie Apocalypse has begun, spread across the globe in a matter of days the undead soon reach the British Isles and overun the Capital. Army blockades are struggling to contain the outbreak, evac centres are hastily set up across the south of England but as the containment fails and the country is engulfed by the undead, a disparate group of survivors find themselves trapped inside a school. With no help of rescue and the undead hordes growing by the day, how and what will these people do to stay alive.
This upcoming zombie flick titled Infected was released in 2013 in the U.K. under the name The Dead Inside. The film received a name change here in the U.S. which now adds confusion to horror fans. In the U.S. it's been released as Infected "Diagnosis Extinction."
