Professors Vooshka and Crump decide to visit an archaeological site to study the artifacts there. Lo and behold, it's right next to a caravan site where all manner of people are staying. With a randy Major owning the site, a snobbish mother, and the two professors' constant innuendos, the film ends with a sinking caravan site and a striptease performance as a replacement for the cabaret night.
Archaeology and camping are a strange combination, but when Major Leep discovers Roman remains under his run-down campsite, the visiting holiday- makers have to mix with the flocking archaeologists. Confusion is bound to follow, and a string of misunderstandings lead to chaos.
