The disappearance of a boy sends an alcoholic cop on the track of a suspicious teacher while falling for the grieving mother.
A cop with a problem of alcoholism is investigating the missing of a teenage boy, same age as his son, with whom he has a problematic relationship. During the investigation, the cop bumps up with the missing boy's teacher, who lives in the same building and is strangely eager to help.
Police Commissioner Francois Visconti is investigating the disappearance of Dany Arnaud. The teenager did not return home. No one knows what happened. Familiarity with the family does not reassure the protagonist. They did not provide him with any valuable information. Seemed a bit strange. The boy's mother is an elegant woman who loves to flirt and does not fit at first glance at the role of a caring spouse, homemaker. The father turned out to be a taciturn, gloomy, angular, rude man. It is likely that if the boy's parents were different, he would not have disappeared.
