A young professional breakup artist reaches a crisis when the girl he's hired to target is the girl he's always wanted.
When an idealistic romantic gets fired from his day job, he is offered a "one-time gig" to break up a girl's relationship for her disapproving parents. This "one-time" gig spreads through word-of-mouth and he ends up becoming a professional match-breaker. Business gets personal, however, when he's hired to destroy the relationship of the girl he's adored and pined for since grade school.
