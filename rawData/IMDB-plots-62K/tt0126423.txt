Pete is a streetwise ex-junkie running from the mob. After his two best friends die, he feels obligated to help raise their three kids who now live with their grandmother.
Micky is a tough, loudmouth but lovable 12 year old who lives with his younger brother and sister at his grandmother's house. One day, a meteorite lands in his backyard and the kids believe that it was sent down to them by their dead parents (who they believe live up in the stars). The government ships away the rock and sends it to the local university. In the children's efforts to retrieve the meteor they believe is theirs, they meet a dorky scientist who finds a place in his heart for the kids. Meanwhile, Micky's parent's best friend, a drug addict (who had promised the parents to take care of the kids) owes drug dealers money and eventually has to hide out after barely escaping a hit.
