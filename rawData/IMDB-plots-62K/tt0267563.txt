The life story of Milford Beeghly: Iowa farmer, early developer of hybrid seed corn, husband, father, grandfather.
A documentary about Milford Beeghly, a radical farmer in the 1930's who pioneered the process of genetically enhanced crops - considered a madman, this documentary is an astonishing portrait of one man's obsessive vision with plants. The film balances the science of farming with the sad neglect of Milford's family. The director uses actual 16 mm footage from the 1930's, animated sequences and interview footage with Milford himself (who is larger than life) from his final years.
