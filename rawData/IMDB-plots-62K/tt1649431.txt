A terrorist threat puts five people in jeopardy.
Cable Raju is a slum dweller who works as a cable operator; Saroja is a prostitute; Ramulu is a debt-ridden weaver from Sircilla; Vivek Chakravarthy is an upcoming rock star; Raheemuddin Qureshi is a Muslim from Old Basti in Hyderabad. The stories of these five characters are interwoven into one.
A lower middle class guy living in a slum dreaming for a better life, the son of an army officer pursuing his dream career as a rock star, a prostitute trying to live on her own, a Muslim man planning to leave the city after facing religious discrimination and a debt-ridden weaver trying to free his grandson from a loan shark are stuck in a hospital under terrorist attack. They all seek redemption from their past for the greater good.
