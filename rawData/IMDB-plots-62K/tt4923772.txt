A small farm community is on the brink of getting swallowed by raging war. Lives of the frightened locals get shaken by the arrival of two men on the run from the mysterious, apparently vengeful Peedu. Following events delve into the fine ties of human relationships and the meaning of individual existence lurking behind them.
