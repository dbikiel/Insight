A young lawyer must work for 6 weeks on a vineyard in order to inherit it.
Seth Vincent expects to inherit the small, traditional vineyard he runs with a single worker, being virtually adopted by the old founder, but finds he can only succeed if his ex Diana Armstrong, the late owner's niece, accepts her half and they collaborate till the next harvest, in six weeks. She refuses to play along and sell to Seth, insisting o actually take part in the harvest, meaning he must teach her. Industrial competitor Grant Gerritson counts on them falling out to buy at least Diana's half above market value. Manipulative Grant gets Diana's boss, a business friend, to offer her a promotion requiring constant travel and sabotages his bright graduate son Paul's budding romance with waitress Amelia, but finds the 'boy' no longer prepared to be his luxury puppet.
