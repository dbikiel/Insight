Set in the Little Saigon district outside of Sydney, a woman (Blanchett) trying to escape her past becomes embroiled in a drug deal.
In Sydney, Tracey Heart is a thirty-two years old manager of a video shop ex-addicted in heroin and clean for four years. She is trying to raise forty thousand dollars to buy a shop for computer games on the next door of the rental and become partner of her boss, but based on her negative records, the banks deny the loan. Tracey takes care of her junkie stepfather Lionel Dawson, unsuccessfully trying to make him quit his heroin habit. When her former boy-friend Jonny returns from Vancouver, Tracey's mother Janelle fears a fall of Tracey, while she blames Jonny for the car accident where her son Ray lost one leg. When Ray and Jonny associate to Moss, the assistant of the retired criminal boss Bradley 'The Jockey' Thompson, in drug dealing, Tracey is convinced by Jonny to join them and raise the necessary money for her business along the weekend.
Tracey Heart's past won't let her go. Aged 32, she's spent the past four years recovering from her heroin habit and redeeming herself in the eyes of her mother. Beset by the complex relationships within her family, her world is thrown into further turmoil by the unexpected return of her ex-boyfriend, Jonny.The criminal aspirations of her brother, Ray, and coping with the attempts of ex-footy star and junkie, Lionel Dawson to withdraw from his habit, almost prove too much. The complexity of deceit within Tracy's own life is mirrored by that within Sydney's drug underworld as Tracey becomes tangled with criminal boss Bradley 'The Jockey' Thompson. Tracey has to confront her own fears before she learns to love again.
