The wonders of internet has made the shady industry of pornography rich, but is now in death cramps due to the piracy ruining the market, and forcing the participants to perform more extreme sex.
With her background and experience in the field, the former French adult film star, director, documentarist, and feminist, Ovidie, investigates the current state of production and distribution of pornography, as the once lucrative adult film industry is in rapid decline more than ever before. Without a doubt, a lot has changed since the advent of the multitude of free online sites, or "tubes", and the crash of the omnipotent DVD market in the mid-2000s, and nowadays, performers earn less while being forced to shoot more and more challenging scenes. But, with a rampant piracy and nearly no profit at all, who is the one who benefits?
