Steve Sinclair is a world-weary former gunslinger, now living as a peaceful rancher. Things go wrong when his wild younger brother Tony arrives on the scene with his new gun and pending bride and former saloon girl Joan Blake.
Granted a small plot of land in a lush valley and a start of cattle by the generous landowner and cattle baron, Dennis Deneen, the once-feared gunslinger, Steve Sinclair, has renounced violence, intent on keeping the peace in the community. However, the sudden arrival of Steve's much younger brother, Tony, and his saloon singer fianc√©e, Joan Blake, will pave the way for a bitter rivalry between siblings, as the volatile young gunfighter craves to prove his mettle. More and more, Tony's tricked-out custom six-shooter demands blood. Is Tony destined to be the lord of the rich valley?
