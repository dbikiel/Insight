A teenager plays cupid for her widowed father but picks the wrong woman.
Pulp novelist Valerie Broughton moves close to her publisher, Christopher Drew, and gives him her latest novel, inscribed "Our Story." She explains that it means only that she couldn't have written it without his help. But when Drew's daughter, June, reads the book and sees the inscription, she jumps to the conclusion that her father is the man and Valerie the woman in her story of unrequited love. Further, she overhears her friend's mother say that Drew would get married if it weren't for his devotion to June. So June resolves to bring Valerie and her father together, not knowing that her father feels Valerie is too pushy, and that he's really fond of June's English teacher, Eleanor Emerson, and has even proposed marriage to her. When June learns of Drew's fondness for Eleanor, she even goes so far as to tell her she would not be welcome as a stepmother. Then June goes back to Valerie to tell her the way is cleared for her, but she sees another man in her house who admits he was the man in her novel. Thoroughly humiliated, June collapses in her bed in tears while Eleanor tells Drew she will not marry him. Drew comforts June, and when she feels better, she wonders how she can make amends to her father.
