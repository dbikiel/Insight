A wise house cat tells a story about how humanity came to be. Long ago, helped by the Singing Magic, Man came to dominion over nature, domesticating wild animals who were once foes. And with each domestication, his own nature and the world around him were changed.
Parents put the baby to sleep and go. The baby cries, and a cat enters the room to join him. The kid tries to grab the cat's tail, but she tells him that this should not be done, according to the contract concluded a thousand years ago. Seeing that the kid does not understand, the cat decides to tell him the story of the Beginning of the Beginnings.
