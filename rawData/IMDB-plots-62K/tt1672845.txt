Two feuding rock stars get handcuffed together for 24 hours at a music festival where they are both due to perform.
In Scotland, the successful American band The Make formed by the singer Adam and the keyboard player Tyko will participate at T in the Park Festival. When they meet the girls from the band The Dirty Pinks, Adam has an argument with the lead singer Morello. A preacher separates them and asks the two bands to pray together. Out of the blue, he handcuffs Adam and Morello and leaves the place in a golf cart. When The Dirty Pinks have to perform, Adam participates with the group and their show is a success. They are forced to spend the night together and his girlfriend Lake and her boyfriend Mark stay with them. But soon they feel that Adam and Morello are connected not only by the handcuffs.
