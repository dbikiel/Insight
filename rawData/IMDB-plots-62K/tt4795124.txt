Finding himself dumped after 25 years of marriage, a man who made a career of seducing rich older women must move in with his estranged sister, where he begins to learn the value of family.
Dumped by his extremely rich 80-year-old wife for a younger boy-toy after twenty-five years of prosperous marriage, pampered, yet penniless gold-digger Maximo is forced to take matters into his own hands, perhaps for the very first time in his once luxurious life. As a result, the ageing gigolo will have no other choice but to seek shelter with his estranged widowed sister Sara and his 10-year-old nephew Hugo, completely unprepared though for a rude awakening coupled with a big slice of real life on the side. But once a seducer, always a seducer and as spoiled Maximo struggles to squeeze out one decent idea that would throw him back into the arms of yet another fabulously wealthy widow, a new opportunity will appear; one that includes a profitable first-rate tutorship in how to be the perfect Casanova.
Having made a career of seducing rich older women, Maximo marries a wealthy woman more than twice his age. 25 years later, spoiled, out of shape and bored from waking up next to his now 80-year-old wife, he gets the surprise of his life when she ends up dumping him for a younger car salesman. Forced out of his mansion and desperate for a place to stay, he contacts Rick, another pampered gigolo. He crashes in the upscale playhouse of the woman's granddaughter, which does not go over very well. He soon moves in with his estranged sister, Sara, and her nerdy son, Hugo, in their small apartment..
