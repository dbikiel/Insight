Once a year the fair comes for one day to the little town 'Sainte-Severe-sur-Indre'. All inhabitants are scoffing at Francois, the postman, what he seems not to recognize. The rising of the flagstaff under his direction nearly leads into a catastrophy - but everybody tells him, how important his work is. Sneering up Francois continues in the evening of the festive day. Made drunk, some 'friends' persuade him to watch a short-movie in a tent. This film is a stunt-show, covered as 'The modern delivery-techniques of the US-post. Francois takes it serious, not recognizing being teased. Next day, after getting sober in a goods wagon, he reorganizes his own delivery-methods. He has not the equipment, as his ideals in the short-movie have, but using only his bicycle, he makes good, funny progresses.
François is a postal delivery man in a small French country town. He is often the center of attention in the town, which is not always a good thing. He tries to be helpful but most in town mock him behind his back. At the Bastille Day festivities in the town, he and the rest of the townsfolk view a movie on the efficiencies of the U.S. Postal Service, the service which has at their disposal airplanes and helicopters to deliver the mail. François is dismayed at how backward he sees the French Postal Service, he only having a bicycle as transport for his postal route. It is even a major process for his company to get him a replacement bicycle tire. François is obsessed with speeding up the delivery of at least the service on his route - doing it as well or even better than the Americans - with only his bicycle, his ingenuity and advice from the townsfolk to do so. His only goal is speed, this goal at any cost. As he implements his ideas, the townsfolk remark on how François is doing it "the American way".
