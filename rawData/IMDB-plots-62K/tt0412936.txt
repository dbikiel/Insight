A gluttonous self-centered cat, Lorenzo, gets punished for his selfishness when his beautiful giant tail develops a personality of its own.
Lorenzo, an arrogant tomcat, lounges indolently on his soft and satin-covered cushion, while flaunting shamelessly his wealth and abundance as well as his dazzling bushy tail to the needy alley cats passing by. However, when a mysterious and tailless black stray cat notices Lorenzo, unexpectedly and as if by magic, the pampered feline will have to go through hell and back before learning a lesson in humility.
