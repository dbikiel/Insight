There's limited potable water on self-destructive Earth. A spaceship sent to a Jupiter moon is now returning fully loaded with water and a crew of 4. Surprises await them.
In the near future, a team is sent on a dangerous mission to Europa to retrieve and bring water back to a dying Earth. Their operation unexpectedly goes awry, jeopardizing not only the lives of those on board but also on earth, resulting in the possible extinction of the human race.
Evolution takes a twist, when, after the Earth is destroyed by a nuclear war, that resulted from the depletion of fresh water on the planet, the crew of the vessel, sent to Europa, in order to collect vital water supplies, finds themselves faced with the dilemma imposed by the needs for humanity to survive.
