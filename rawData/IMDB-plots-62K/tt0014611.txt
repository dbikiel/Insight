A hypochondriac vacations in the tropics for the fresh air - and finds himself in the middle of a revolution instead.
Harold Van Pelham (Lloyd) is a hypochondriac, rich businessman who sails to the tropics for his 'health.' Instead of the peace and seclusion he is seeking, he finds himself in the middle of a revolution. He is imprisoned where he befriends the friendly giant, Colosso (Aasen), and they engineer an escape. Together, they quell the revolution.
Young, wealthy hypochondriac Harold Van Pelham has decided to go to the tropical isle of Paradiso off the west coast of South America to convalesce. With him are his nurse who is secretly in love with him, and Mr. Pipps, his valet. What they are unaware of is that a revolution is currently taking place on Paradiso, led by American James H. Blake, the revolutionaries who are opposed by the big banks who feel the revolution is undermining their economic efforts. As such, the banks have informed Blake that they are sending a representative to Paradiso to stop the revolution. Upon Harold and his entourage's arrival on Paradiso, Blake immediately believes they are representatives of the bank. Harold is blissfully unaware of things happening around him as he is separated from his nurse and Pipps, and as he tries to make his way to the hotel. But in helping a giant named Colosso, who is an enemy of the revolution, Harold further places himself in a precarious position, while all he wants to do is get some rest all in the name of his health.
