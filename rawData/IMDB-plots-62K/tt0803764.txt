A man walking on the fields encounters a shapeshifting alien visitor from outer space.
A city artist walks through countryside enjoying the scenery and wildlife - birds and butterflies, imagining them pinned and caged. When he arrives at a pond, singing the famous melody: Love theme from The Godfather. An alien ship lands nearby and a curious alien tries to make contact only to scare the wits out of the artist who runs from the alien for his life, thinking he might be caged just like those birds. There is no escape, and the friendly alien finally catches up with him and starts humming the same melody, which becomes instrumental for the plot of this animated film.
The animation film tells about a meeting between a man and an alien who flew to Earth, trying to study it, and to know through imitation of the things seen. The beauty and harmony of the surrounding world is shown, based on the example of a person's good relationship to nature, and that one can always find a common language (through music) with someone else - not like you. The theme of the universe, present in the soul and the world of each of us, is revealed.
