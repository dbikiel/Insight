A woman of wild beauty, she was married to a sailor. However, there were rumours in the village that she was having a relationship with another man and so all her neighbours disowned her because of her supposedly adulterous behaviour. But Alejandro was totally and madly in love with her. 
Back in the present day, and still wrapped up in his memories, Alejandro suddenly thinks he sees her appear just around the street corner. No. No. It cant be...It was someone else. But even though it seems like madness.. it is her it is the same woman with whom he fell in love. Time has stood still for her.
