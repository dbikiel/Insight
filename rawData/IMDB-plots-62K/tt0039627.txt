Pretty Molly Lucian (Barbara White) enlists the reluctant aid of psychologist Felix Milne (Burgess Meredith) in treating her potentially homicidal husband Adam (Kieron Moore), who refuses to see a "real" psychiatrist. Traumatized in a Japanese prison camp, Adam proves to be on the verge of severe schizophrenia. In his risky struggle to help Adam, Felix finds his none-too-functional home life deteriorating, and is unable to help himself as he helps others. The situation rushes headlong to a suspenseful climax.
In postwar London, clinical psychologist Felix Milne (Burgess Meredith) is close to burnout. He has his own marital difficulties as well as an overloaded schedule. Most of his patients aren't really ill or even neurotic, but just need someone to listen to their ordinary troubles. Milne is faced with more of a challenge when he's asked to treat former P.O.W. Adam Lucian (Kieron Moore). Felix is underqualified to treat complicated conditions like Adam's, but feels almost compelled to try to help.
