A girl is approached by a strange boy outside her high school. He asks her to follow him to hear stories where gods fall in love with human beings.
When Europa skips class and meets a magnetic young man named Jupiter, she embarks on a journey of which she knows little as to what lies ahead. Travelling aboard Jupiter's eight-wheel truck, they arrive in a mythical land inhabited by powerful gods who can transform humans into plants or animals in the blink of an eye. Europa watches, listens, and plays in their immortal home, becoming acquainted with Jupiter's friends, Bacchus and Orpheus. As the confrontation between seductive, yet vengeful gods and innocent mortals unfolds, Europa grasps a greater sense of life and love in this revelatory modern-day retelling of Ovid's "Metamorphoses."
