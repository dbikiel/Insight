How many seconds do you have left to live?
Born in a DNA laboratory of an Ice Age corpse, Catarina (Ivana Baquero), is raised in a secret place, far from the eyes of the world, but under the control of her creators who examine her evolution. The little girl grows up, but when she succeeds in fleeing her captivity, she discovers a world in which reality and fiction merge irrevocably into an account of love, tragedy, and immortality.
