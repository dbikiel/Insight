In the near future... The world is in turmoil. Pollution is thick and heavy and energy sources are nearing exhaustion. The situation is out of control. In an urgent bid to solve the problem, missions are launched to explore the universe for planets that may contain alternative sources of energy. One of the mining ships, Ezekiel, finds an uncharted planet that reveals signs of a possible fuel resource. Two crew members are sent to check it out and collect any samples for later analysis. The mission goes well until they reach grid reference 3894 where they discover a dark and terrifying truth.
