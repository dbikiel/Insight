In a sunken castle underneath the earth, five strangers wake. They have no food. No memory. No water. And no way out. They don't know it yet, but they're capable of something they never imagined. They must organize and band together for the sinister adventure that awaits them.
In the dungeon, five strangers wake up without any awareness of where they are, and why they are there. Each stranger, who each have something in common, find out that they will need to follow the steps to reach to the end. However, that won't be easy, as there are always traps along the way. Will they get out?
