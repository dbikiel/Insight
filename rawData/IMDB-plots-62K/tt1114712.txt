In less than twenty-four hours, a middle-aged academic and his nearly half his age fiancée will get married in Iceland's windswept island, Flatey, amid endless preparations and bitter second thoughts. Is this what they really want?
Jon, a middle-aged professor is going to get married tomorrow, for the second time, to one of his ex-students half his age. But it's not all roses. First, there's his cranky mother-in-law-to-be who violently opposes the marriage and who demands repayment of Jon's loan before the wedding night. Second, his plans to build a golf course on the little island of Flatey where they live aren't going at all to plan. Third, his extremely drunk best man is on the loose without any shoes and lastly, the continual presence of his emotional first wife is haunting his every move. When the guests start flocking to the island, Jon starts getting cold feet. After a very long night of drinking and thinking, will Jon be able to make it to the church on time?
In less than twenty-four hours, the middle-aged academic, Jon, and his nearly half his age fiancée and former student, Thora, will get married at a small chapel in Iceland's windswept island, Flatey. Much to her mother's dismay, the young bride is ecstatic, on the other hand, though, the pensive and self-absorbed lecturer still lets his past to hold him back. Eventually, against the backdrop of a pale midnight sun; endless preparations; bitter second thoughts, and an unfulfilled debt, Jon and Thora will attempt to tie the knot; however, is this what they really want?
