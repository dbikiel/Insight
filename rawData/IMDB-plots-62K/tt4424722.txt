Carnage, death, and despair await the ignoble remnants of a persecuted family who assemble for the wedding of their daughter on the eve of an evil 100-year-old curse.
Kate travels with her former fiance Cody to the house of her estranged parents for the wedding of her lesbian sister Aggie with Rose. Kate and Cody pose as if they were engaged and after the lunch party with her family, they head to a remote place where Rose's family lives. They have dinner with the weird family of Rose that wears black and they go to the beach for the pagan ceremony. However Kate and her aunt Paula stay behind since Paula is not feeling well. Soon they discover the creepy secret of the dark family.
For generations, the ignoble family of the Sklars has been hunted down like dogs, and as a scourge that plagues a land, they have been almost wiped off, even though this blood-drenched soil rightfully belonged to them. Slaughtered and facing persecution wherever they have gone, up to the present day, only seven managed to survive and now, after many ordeals, they can finally celebrate, as the joyous union between their daughter Aggie and her sweetheart Rose will assemble the two families in a remote island for the event. However, in contrast to the festivities, the formal and polite ambience, something is quite off, moreover, unbeknownst to Rose and her family, on the day of their wedding, an evil 100-year-old curse is about to be fulfilled. Soon, as the day of the ceremony arrives, the sightings of inconspicuous mystical runes will multiply, and before long, the indistinct nuance of deceit that shrouds the atmosphere will inevitably lead to carnage, death, and despair.
