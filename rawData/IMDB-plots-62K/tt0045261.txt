After Donald plays a cruel Halloween prank on his nephews, the 3 team-up with a witch and her broom to teach him a lesson about 'tricks and treats.'
Donald's nephews come by for Halloween and Donald plays tricks on them. But Witch Hazel was watching, and offers to help the boys get even. She brews up a potion that animates inanimate objects and sics them on Donald. He initially agrees to treat the boys, until he hears the witch call him a "pushover". She animates his feet to get him to cough up the key to his pantry.
On Halloween night, a mischievous witch named Hazel, and her broom B.Z. Bub, happen to observe Donald Duck play a cruel prank on his nephews. Hazel and her broom agree to help the boys get a treat.After mixing a special potion, Hazel and the boys fly around on B.Z., with Hazel spraying the potion on myriad objects. Before long, pumpkins are flying through the air and wooden fence posts become singing ghosts. The racket soon alerts Donald, who is then accousted by Hazel, who demands he give the boys a treat. Donald eagerly complies, until Hazel mentions to the boys that 'this one is a push-over.'Donald then changes his tune, locking the pantry in his house, and swallowing the key. Hazel then uses her potion to enchant Donald's feet to kick the key out of him. It seems the plan has worked until Donald grabs the key and throws it under the pantry door, keeping anyone from opening it. Hazel then gives Donald's feet an extra dose of potion, and orders them to break down the door. After instructing Donald's feet to get a head start ('about a mile or two!'), Donald comes screaming in through the front door, and with a crash, the pantry door is open! The nephews happily collect their goodies, as Hazel and B.Z. Bub say goodbye.
