A genetically bred Nazi super soldier fights Allied troops.
As WWII is winding down, the Nazi's have developed the uber weapon, a super soldier, a blueish pink version of the Incredible Hulk. A team of Allied soldiers, including a snooty Frenchman, "Brooklyn" (with the heaviest of fake accents) among others is sent behind enemy lines to destroy this secret Nazi weapon.
The naziz's (bad guys) begin using atomic radiation to creat super soldiers (be afraid) so the allies (good guys) launch a secret mission to stop them.
