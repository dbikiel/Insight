A TV presentation of the successful London stage show. A fully operatic production very loosely based on the 'Jerry Springer' TV show.
'Jerry Springer-The Opera' tells the story of a day in the job of world famous talk-show host, Jerry Springer. Jerry has to sort out a number of guests problems; including a man who wants to dress up as a baby, a man with 3 lovers (one of them a transexual) and a fat woman who wants to be a pole dancer. However, on this particular day, something out of the ordinary will happen...
Jerry Springer is the host of the world's most notorious chat show. His guests are a parade of misfits, losers, adulterers and sexual deviants - and boy, can they sing! When Jerry is shot at the climax of one particularly seedy edition of his show, the Devil seizes the opportunity to solve his problems by forcing Jerry to present his show in Hell... with guests including Jesus, Mary, Adam and Eve, and God himself. Can Jerry unite Heaven and Hell? Will Satan get his apology? Will Jesus grow up and put some clothes on?
