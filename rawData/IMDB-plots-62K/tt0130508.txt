A knight finds his village destroyed and abandoned. He tries to track the attackers down and avenge his family, but almost drowns. A maiden, prisoner of Black Knight, saves him, so he vows to free her, even though she warns him not to.
A popular Lucas-approved short that was in some markets aired in theaters as a companion piece to Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back. Sir Maddox, a knight returning from the Crusades, finds his village and keep destroyed by unknown attackers. Most of the inhabitants are dead, including his family, and the few that did survive have become infected with a disease, possibly the plague. Having left nothing to live for, Sir Maddox decides to track the attackers down and avenge his family and village. In the nearby forest, he stops by a lake, but accidentally falls into it and almost drowns due to the weight of his armor. However, a mysterious beautiful maiden in white appears to him and he is somehow saved. Thankful beyond words, he asks who she is and learns that she's a prisoner of Black Angel, a mysterious eerie knight in black armor. Sir Maddox immediately vows to free her, but she, saddened, implores him to stay away from the evil knight. His word being his bond, Sir Maddox tracks the ominous Black Angel down anyway with the suspicious help of a strange shady snickering peasant and learns firsthand why the creature is so feared.
A knight returns from the wars to find his homeland ravaged and plague-ridden. When he falls into a lake, his life is saved by a maiden bound to the Black Angel. He vows to save her.
