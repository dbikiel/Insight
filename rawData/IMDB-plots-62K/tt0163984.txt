The Upside: Fat Cash...The Flipside...Every Thug, Crook, Punk and Mercenary on the planet looking to get rich.
Slick-talking Bob and Sid run a bankrupt used-car lot. They used to work for Danny Woo, whose lot next door is the most successful one in Needles. Danny's still their friend, and what with his sick wife, Bob and Sid agree to cover for him during an IRS investigation into his finances. Meanwhile, a series of murders and an FBI investigation focus on a Pontiac convertible with a mysterious cargo originating in the Andes. Bob and Sid's shady supplier offers them $250,000 to stash the car on their lot for a couple days; Bob's reluctant, but Sid sees this as their ticket out. They say yes, then try to run a double cross on the Pontiac's mysterious and ruthless owner.
