Decades before Hogwarts, Ursula K. Le Guin invited young readers to wizard school in her classic Earthsea fantasy series, and dazzled the science fiction world with masterworks like The Left Hand of Darkness and The Dispossessed. Worlds of Ursula K. Le Guin tells the groundbreaking author's story in her own words, sprinkled with stunning animation and commentary from literary luminaries like Margaret Atwood, Neil Gaiman, David Mitchell, and Michael Chabon. Produced with Le Guin's participation over ten years, Worlds of Ursula K. Le Guin is a breathtaking journey through the late writer's career and her worlds, both real and fantastic.
