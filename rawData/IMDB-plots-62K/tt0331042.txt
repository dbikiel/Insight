6 college students from different backgrounds, are assigned to work together on a final project. These six students have so far spent no time together, can't stand each other and must pass this final assignment in order to pass the class. The assignment is to create a utopian society, on paper. They've had all semester to work on the project but in the tradition of most college group assignments, have opted to wait until the last minute to cram the entire semester's work into one night. The film explores the six character's differences, commonalities and secrets, and the real stuff they have to go through in order to accomplish the task at hand. Over the course of the night, the students learn how their pre-conceived stereotypes are often incorrect. As we discover the differences that Nera, Justin, Caleb, Aaliyah, Ken and Tanci have, we also find out what makes them part of the same human family. In trying to create their own Utopian Society, our characters discover just how hard it is to make it work in a world as diverse as the one they live in.
Six college students have been randomly selected to work together as a group on a class project - writing a paper on how to create a utopian society. Being procrastinators (who isn't in college), they have waited until they have only one night to finish their assignment. Before they can get down to work, they have to get past the fact that they don't like each other, they all cast judgments on each other based on stereotypes, and they can't stop arguing about every topic that comes up. If they can figure out how to work together, they've got it made.
