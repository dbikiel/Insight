A Native American warrior called Navajo Joe seeks revenge on a gang of sadistic outlaws who has massacred the people of his tribe.
Ravaging the land like a pitiless scourge, Vee Duncan's savage gang of cutthroats massacre the entire tribe of a peaceful Navajo village, scalping them all for a dollar apiece. With his companion brutally murdered, the Navajo native and the slaughter's sole survivor, Joe, stealthily pursues the blood-thirsty outlaws on their way to the small town of Esperanza, where a treacherous member of the community encourages Duncan to hijack a government train crammed with cash. Their well-thought strategy guarantees success; however, Navajo Joe still thirsts for retribution. Can a single man foil the plans of Duncan's ferocious crowd of killers?
