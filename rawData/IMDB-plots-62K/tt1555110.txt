Seeking revenge and justice, Cole Brandt finds himself in the lawless town of Dead River where he is faced with one last bloody showdown for freedom in order to protect The Majestic Saloon and a beautiful woman.
In 1889, a reclusive gun-for-hire, Cole Brandt, travels the barren Arizona desert bringing wanted fugitives to justice, dead or alive. He drifts from town to town, hunting down and seeking revenge on the men who killed his wife and child five years prior. When his travels take him to the lawless town of Dead River, he signs on to protect The Majestic Saloon, owned by Thomas Morgan and his wife, Sarah. Brandt soon meets a beautiful, innocent prostitute, Cassey May, who works at The Raven, the local brothel and hotel. Travis McCain, the owner of The Raven, is an outlaw who has taken control of Dead River, leaving the residents to live in fear of McCain and his rogue group of men. McCain soon learns about the relationship between Brandt and Cassey May, and threatens Cassey May with her life. Cassey May defies McCain, escaping The Raven, seeking protection with Sarah and Brandt at The Majestic Saloon. Brandt is then faced with the dangerous task of defending Sarah and Cassey May, with no choice but to face off with McCain and his killers. All hell breaks loose when McCain puts a bounty on Brandt's head, as the stage is set for a bloody showdown. One man that dares to stand up to evil. One town that will be changed forever. One last stand in a fight for freedom. The day has come.
