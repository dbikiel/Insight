Superman battles train robbers seeking to steal a billion dollars worth of gold.
An enormous gold shipment en route to the mint is hijacked by well armed robbers, and Lois Lane is trapped in the runaway locomotive. This looks like a job for Superman...
The headline in the "Daily Planet" announces that the world's largest shipment of gold bullion is to be shipped by train. Lois Lane, voice of (Joan Alexander), is dispatched to ride the train and cover the story, and mild-mannered Clark Kent , voice of (Bud Collyer), sees her off at the depot. Returning to his office he learns that the train is under siege by robbers and is careening out of control. Sounds like a job for Superman. Paramoung production number W1-3.
