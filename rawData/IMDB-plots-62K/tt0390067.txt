A 3000 mile race from San Francisco to Miami that took place in the Spring of 2003. 150 cars and stars created all kinds of mayhem and chaos over 6 days racing from coast to coast!
A real life version of the famous 70's Cannonball Run movie called 'Gumball 3000'. Narrated by the legendary Burt Reynolds, watch the Jackass stars, mixing up their Dick Dastadley tricks with the Cuban Brothers, supermodel Jodie Kidd, Hip Hop and rock stars, Extreme Sports skateboard God Tony Hawk, World Moto X Champion Travis Pastrana, and numerous other eccentric characters as they race 3000 miles coast to coast in some of the world's most amazing and custom cars ever built. And be amazed at the Swedish Koenigsegg Supercar clocking up 242 MPH in Texas and talk his way out of a speeding ticket, as well as Ferrari's, Lamborghini's, Bentley's, and even a nitros-injected VW Campervan take to the streets for the ultimate 'road trip'!
