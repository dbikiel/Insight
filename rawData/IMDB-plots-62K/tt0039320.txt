Dick Tracy goes up against a villain who robs banks using a nerve gas.
A gang of criminals, which includes a piano player and an imposing former convict known as 'Gruesome', has found out about a scientist's secret formula for a gas that temporarily paralyzes anyone who breathes it. When Gruesome accidentally inhales some of the gas and passes out, the police think he is dead and take him to the morgue, where he later revives and escapes. This puzzling incident attracts the interest of Dick Tracy, and when the criminals later use the gas to rob a bank, Tracy realizes that he must devote his entire attention to stopping them.
L. E. Thal (Edward Ashley), a discredited doctor, obtains a mysterious gas that has criminal possibilities. Gruesome (Boris Karloff) and his pal Melody (Tony Barrett) visit Thal's laboratory, where Gruesome takes a whiff of the gas and is presumed dead. In the morgue Gruesome revives, escapes from police officer Pat Patton (Lyle Latell), and he and Meldoy use the gas to stage a daring bank robbery. Tess Trueheart (Anne Gwynne), witnesses the robbery and telephones her sweetheart, police detective Dick Tracy (Ralph Byrd), but the bandits have fled when Tracy arrives. Tracy learns from Doctor I.M. Learned (June Clayworth), that the inventor of the gas, Dr. A. Tomic (Milton Parsons), is missing. Gruesome and Melody, fleeing from Tracy and Patton in a car chase, have a wreck and Gruesome escapes and the injured Melody is taken to a hospital. Knowing that Gruesome will come for his pal, Tracy takes his place in the hospital bed.
