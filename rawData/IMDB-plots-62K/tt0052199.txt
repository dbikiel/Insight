A brave prince wants to win the heart of a stubborn princess by finding the singing, ringing tree for her. He finally locates it in the magical realm of an evil dwarf who offers him a deal: he can keep the tree if it starts singing before sundown - which it will only do if the princess truly loves him. Otherwise, he will be turned into a bear. Reminiscent of fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm.
The Prince is turned into a bear who tries to teach the spoiled Princess lessons toward kindness, compassion and empathy toward mythical creatures such as a Unicorn. The evil dwarf becomes more and more enraged as the princess' gradually discovers that she loves the gruff bear who has shown her how to become a feeling woman. She kisses the Bear who she has fallen in love with despite having previously been cruel and mean to. The dwarf implodes with anger when the Singing Ringing Tree starts to sing and the magical winter ends. The curse is broken and the Bear sheds his skin to reveal the Prince.
