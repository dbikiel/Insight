A costume drama and satire about financial skull-duggery, and confidence tricksters in both the upper and lower classes in Victorian London. A working class man impersonates a Lord who is supposedly very rich, and a financial wizard. As such, he is invited to all the best peoples' parties. In fact, he is not, and his wealth and expertise are more in the minds of his associates than in reality. Interestingly, despite the large social gap between the two classes, there are many similarities in what goes on in both within this story. This can be seen as the main character switches back and forth between his charade as a peer, and his real self.
