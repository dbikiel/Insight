A corrupt young man somehow keeps his youthful beauty eternally, but a special painting gradually reveals his inner ugliness to all.
In contemporary London, a beautiful and rich young man, Dorian Gray, loves Sybil Vane, an aspiring actress; thanks to her, he's momentarily less self-centered. He's also sitting for a portrait painted by his friend, Basil Hallward; when it's done, Dorian complains he will grow old while the painting stays unchanged. On the same night, he slaps Sybil and sends her away, then accepts the seductive offer of a party's hostess to sleep with her. The next day, the painting looks slightly older as he becomes corrupt and amoral, capable of destroying many lives inclusive Sybil's. In horror and fascination, Dorian hides away the portrait and continues a life of degradation. Over time, as the portrait becomes hideous, he's unchanged by debauched life; finally, he and Basil face the painting.
In the late 1960s London, the beautiful and rich model Dorian Gray meets the aspiring actress Sybil Vane and they fall in love for each other. Meanwhile, his friend Basil Hallward concludes his painting, and Dorian Gray, fascinated with the picture, proposes the devil to exchange his soul for eternal youth and beauty. On the same night, he slaps Sybil and sends her away, then accepts the seductive offer of a party's hostess to sleep with her. From this moment on, the character and behavior of the former sweet Dorian changes and he becomes a corrupt and amoral man, capable of destroying many lives inclusive Sybil's. While his friends grow older, Dorian remains young never aging, but his painting discloses his innermost ugliness, fruit of his despicable social conduct.
