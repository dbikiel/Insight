At 12 years old, Kermit the Frog and best friends Goggles and Croaker travel outside their homes in the swamps of the Deep South to do something extraordinary with their lives.
Kermit the Frog (Whitmire) whilst on his travels back to the swamp he grew up on, remembers one of his earlier adventures. Kermit, Croaker (Barretta), Goggles (Mazzarino) and Blotch (Kennedy) are sent on a wild adventure into the outside world, when Croaker and bully Blotch and kidnapped and placed in a pet store. It's now up to Kermit and Goggle, with help from a friendly dog called Pilgrim (Summer) to save them. But someone else has his eye on them. Dr Krassman (Hostetter) wants to buy all the frogs and use them in biology lessons.
