Troy and sheil married with kids living happy life and poppy find a woman.
Every year, these friends get together for a weekend retreat. This year sparks fly from the first moment: Diana (an attorney married to Terry) is distressed that the unhappily married Sheila has brought her friend Trina along. Diana thinks Trina has her gold-digging sights set on Mike, Sheila's mean-spirited husband. This year, their unmarried friend, Troy, comes alone. The weekend ends early in disclosures and heartbreak. A year later, the six people - plus Terry's widowed father, Poppy - gather and this time they each address the question, "Why did I get married?" The answers reveal beliefs, decisions, and personalities. At any moment, someone might break into song.
