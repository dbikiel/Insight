Emiliano looks at his life with the eyes of a film director, mixing the objective reality with the processes of the artistic creation. The story he is filming flounders with his daily life, until his world is trapped in the lens of his camera. Confused, always alone and in front of a screen, now become a transfigured reality, but at the same time a measurable, controllable and manipulable one, he listens in loop to a song: one of those songs you sing or repeat as a prayer and forcing you to remember, believe and convince yourself.
The story of Emilio (Hugo Catalan) a young and renowned director of documentaries, who is filming his new project, a film about dance. During the filming, he meets Octavio (Alan Ram√≠rez), a quiet but sensitive dancer with whom he initiates a passionate and loving relationship. But Emilio's "monster of self-destruction" makes his spontaneous romance suffer. Emilio, who has serious drug problems, decides to start another relationship, but now with Jazen (Emilio von Sternerfels) a young escort, and again romance begins.
