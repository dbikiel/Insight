A real life documentary following the events of September 11 from an insider's view, through the lens of James Hanlon and two French filmmakers who were in Manhattan that one day.
On September 11, 2001, filmmaker James Hanlon and Jules and Gedeon Naudet were filming a documentary on a rookie New York City firefighter when they noticed a plane overhead. That plane would hit the World Trade Center. They rushed immediately to the scene. James Hanlon and the Naudets filmed throughout Sept. 11 and the days afterward from the firemen's perspective, as it became clear to them that this was the only known footage from inside the Twin Towers that day.
This film was directed by Jules and Gedeon Naudet, and NY firefighter James Hanlon. The Naudet brothers intended to film a documentary on "probie" firefighter Tony Benetatos. The firehouse Benetatos was assigned to was just blocks from the World Trade Center.On the day of the attacks, the Naudets turned their cameras to the horror unfolding around them. Only they were able to film from within the Trade Center as the second tower was hit, and as it collapsed.
