An English couple's holiday in Spain is interrupted when they discover a girl imprisoned in a cabin.
Ledoyen and Considine play a young married couple at the end of the 1970s, who come to visit a friend (Oldman) who now lives in the Basque region because he has married a woman from there (Sánchez-Gijón). Their tranquil summer turns to horror when they discover a girl with horribly mutilated hands in the forest. They try to help her by taking her away from the home in which she is locked, but the local villagers, who have to protect the girl, start a pursuit in the forest they know much better than the visitors.
Summer 1978: an English couple are going through a difficult patch in their relationship, and so decide to spend the summer in the house that their friends have bought in the north of Spain.Very much off the beaten track, the house seems ideal for some peaceful holidays. But their tranquillity is abruptly shattered when they discover a girl with horribly deformed hands locked away in a cabin in the woods. Filthy and unable to talk, the girl is obviously terrified and so the couple decide to take her to the police. But their attempts to help the girl are hampered by the denseness of the forest, as well as by a group of local villagers who seem determined to keep the girl in atrocious conditions.
