Framed for a robbery he didn't commit, a man flees to a Caribbean island and gets involved with a woman, gun-runners and murder.
When ex-convict cabbie Jimmy Carmody is framed in a jewelry store robbery and murder, an old friend arranges for him to flee the country to the island of Caribo, where a person's past doesn't matter. Once there, he is approached by his pal Rocky Crane and invited to join their gun-smuggling operation to assist forces that want to overthrow the local military dictatorship under Colonel Gomez. Though Carmody refuses, his new job at a hotel where Crane's aide (and his girlfriend's brother) lives involves him deeper in the revolution plot.
Accused of a robbery he didn't commit, ex-con Jimmy Carmody flees to the island of Caribo, safe haven for crooks and criminals, and run with an iron, but fair, hand by strongman Colonel Gomez. Initially asked to join up with and help old crime buddy Rocky Crane, Jimmy opts out and instead gets an honest job at an inn run by pretty Sally Haines and her mother. Danny, Sally's wise-guy brother, is running around with his boss Rocky's wife Rita, who has just caused Rocky to be arrested by Gomez in a gun-running escapade. Rocky escapes and, jealous, confronts Danny, who manages to kill him first. Sally, who has fallen in love with Jimmy, has a dilemma on her hands as Danny, for whom she has given a false alibi to Gomez, has just planted the murder weapon on Jimmy that will land him in front of Gomez' firing squad unless she tells the truth about Rocky's death.
