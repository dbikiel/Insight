Sergei and Marina's crisis has come in family life. During one of the fights, they decide to go to an exotic journey. All the way between the spouses do not cease strife, which in the end lead to the fact that they find themselves on a desert island, lost in the ocean. Rather than fight together to survive, our heroes continue to sort things out, moving gradually to the present fighting. On top of unhappiness it is that the island is inhabited by a tribe militant natives.
