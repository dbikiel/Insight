A successful corporate type harboring a deep, dark secret befriends a free-spirited stranger who encourages him to ditch his stuffy lifestyle and live life in reckless abandon.
Locked doors, and the monster inside us. In L.A., tightly-wound Julian Wright is separated. He meets Michael, she's seductive and uninhibited; by chance, a few days later they connect. The PR firm where he's creative director is competing to be bought by a household name (think Proctor &amp; Gamble); winning will bring money, status, and a big ad budget. His firm's win depends on both his ideas and his maintaining traditional values; so, he puts his divorce on hold. His family adds problems: childhood memories and his sister's abusive husband threaten his balance. His fuse is short. Will self control hold obsession and fury in check, or is Michael the spark that will start a conflagration?
The film centers on Julian Wright (Clarke), a charming and mega-successful businessman who hides a secret from the rest of the world which tears his soul apart every day. With his personal life in shambles, Julian will find himself willing to travel down the rabbit hole, as it were, when he meets Michael Reed (Vega), a gorgeous stranger who entices Julian to forget his rigid corporate world and try a more bohemian lifestyle, a decision that will not only affect his own life but those of his boss and co-workers, as well as inspire his half-sister Rita (Pinkett Smith) to re-examine her life with her abusive husband.
