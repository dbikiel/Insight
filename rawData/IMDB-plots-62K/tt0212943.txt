Classic Soviet cartoon about the film industry.
At the beginning of the animated film, the screenwriter tries to write the script, but without success. In a fit of despair, the screenwriter is about to commit suicide, but here, literally, the muse of inspiration descends on him. At this time, the director came into the office, who, after reading the script, enthusiastically praises him and takes on it to make a film.
