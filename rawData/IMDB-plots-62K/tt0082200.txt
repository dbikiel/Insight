A hard-nosed Chicago journalist has an unlikely love affair with an eagle researcher.
Ernie Souchak (John Belushi), a tough Chicago reporter, gets a little too close to the Mob, and is assaulted by two crooked police officers sent by a crooked councilman, and ends up in the hospital. To take the heat off of him, his editor sends him to Colorado to investigate an eagle researcher ('Blair Brown'). Sparring partners at first, the pair eventually fall in love, but Souchak must return to Chicago when one of his sources is mysteriously killed.
This movie is a procedural film about a city guy who makes too many enemies and gets
sent out to the mountains. He meets a tough
girl who eventually falls in love with him. Unfortunately
they cannot live in the same environment. She comes to Chicago then has to go back to the mountain. They get married at an Amtrak station.Lots of funny sex on the train. In the end, they part ways, like oil and water.
