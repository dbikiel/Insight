First-time filmmaker and award-winning photographer Sam Jones documents the recording of Wilco's album, "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot."
First time director Sam Jones documents the making of Wilco's fourth studio Album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. Named after the Wilco song that is featured on Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, an album that strays from the Alt-country that made them famous. Jones' desire was to document the creative work of YHF's production, he seems to have found a bit more, including band members departing and a conflict with Reprise record company. This is a true documentry of art versus money-driven media conglomerates.
A movie presumably intended to document Wilco's recording of what is supposed to be their "breakthrough" album, "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot." However, the documentary quickly becomes a chronicle of a band in turmoil. Although the album is destined to later be declared a classic by critics, the band's record label rejects it and drops Wilco from the label--citing the album's lack of marketability. The problems are further complicated when band leader Jeff Tweedy fires another band member after the album is completed because of creative differences. However, the band is determined to move on and find a new record label that will accept the album and respect their need for creative freedom.
