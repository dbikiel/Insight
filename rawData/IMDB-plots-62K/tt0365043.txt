Estranged teen sisters who live on opposite sides of the country are brought together, much to their surprise, as teammates in the TV show "The Challenge", a Survivor-style adventure in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.
It's an action adventure/adventure comedy. They play estranged twins with very opposite personalities. Lizzie is very focused and driven, while Shane is more relaxed, but concerned about the environment. Both girls are chosen for a Survivor-like popular game show with college scholarships as the prize.
Shane is very into nature and Lizzie is not. They are complete opposites, or so they think. Both enter to be in a TV show and the producers of the show think it would be fun to put them both on the same team when they hate each other. Shane lives in Los Angeles with her mom and Lizzie in Washington, D.C. with her dad. They haven't seen each other in 2 years. They are both put on team Mayan and they have to try and get along for the sake of the team, and their college scholarships. They of course break some romance rules with some guys.
