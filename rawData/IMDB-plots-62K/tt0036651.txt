Peter owns a small but upscale caf√© on the road between Reno and Lake Tahoe in Nevada. He is a heavy gambler and his marriage is rocky. Into is life come a waitress named Sally.
Married for ten years, Frenchman Peter Donay, a reformed Monte Carlo gambler, and American Delilah Donay own and operate Cafe Donay, an upscale French restaurant outside of Lake Tahoe. Delilah can tell that Peter's mind has been elsewhere of late, which she further knows is due to his infatuation with Sally Murfin, their young, blonde waitress, demonstrating that Peter's pre-marriage womanizing ways are resurfacing. Sally is already engaged to her longtime beau Freddie Bilson, who works at the nearby service station, their engagement which doesn't stop her from flirting with Peter in liking the attention and arguably a large gambling windfall that exposed Peter's gambling habit also as being less than reformed. Beyond the issue of Sally, Peter and Freddie don't much like each other, Peter because of the air of "grease monkey" Freddie gives the restaurant every time he drives up in his beaten up motorcycle. Delilah believes that Freddie and Sally getting married sooner than later will halt Peter's infatuation with Sally, the marriage only possible if Freddie earns more money than he can make at the service station. When that plan for Freddie to earn more money turns out to be less than fruitful, Delilah, with a little help from their faithful bartender/wine steward Johnny, turns to Plan B to expose both Peter and Sally's deep down feelings.
