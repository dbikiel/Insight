Dreaming of an actress future, a young girl arrives in Paris. Her personality awakens a glowing passion of several different men.
A woman and three men. Nina, who's come to Paris to act and sleeps with any man at hand, meets Paulot, a young estate agent; he's smitten. She also meets Paulot's flatmate Quentin, a compulsive who stalks her. To Paulot's jealous dismay, she's willing to sleep with Quentin, and wants Paulot's friendship. After a desperate act by Quentin, Nina and Paulot share a flat, but she still won't take him as a lover; instead, her energy goes into a production of "Romeo and Juliet" directed by a detached, intense man who becomes her father figure. Quentin's ghost taunts her, Paulot wants to end all contact, and the director plans to return to London. The art of the theater may be her only refuge.
Nina is the young lady friend of timid Paulot. Though she intends to be true to him, she falls in love with his roommate Quentin, a thoroughly self-centered actor who performs in live sex shows. After a torrid affair with Nina, Quentin dies under questionable circumstances. Nina's search for answers to Quentin's sudden death leads her to Scrutzler, the theatre director who'd once cast Quentin in Romeo and Juliet. Scrutzler has likewise suffered a terrible loss in his life: his Juliet was also his daughter, who also died unexpectedly. Apparently, it was the daughter's death that led to Quentin's demise. On impulse, Scrutzler casts the inexperienced Nina as Juliet - and before long, both unhappy souls find a common emotional ground.
