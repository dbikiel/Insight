Ana is an exemplary girl that has been educated in the 'normality' of a middle-class family. She has never been brave enough to break with all the regulations that her well-led life was supposed to be. The appearance of a double that starts living her life and doing all of her obligations, allows Ana to adopt total anonymity for the very first time. This fact becomes something that she understands as the opportunity to choose the life she wants without giving any reason to anybody, as the way to find total freedom and also happiness. Who is this double, where she comes from and why she appears are questions that I am not interested in answering in the film. This is just the starting point that is accepted as the motor that helps Ana to have the courage to fight for her own existence. Ana tries to make her own runaway possible breaking with everything, looking for her own limits, living a life opposed to whatever everybody expected from her. The action will be set in 3 scenarios where Ana, now called Nina, will start living her new life: The hostel where she settles down, an old fashioned Music Hall, and Marcelo, a man who is also running away from something. And also the night. The night as the scenario where she can hide from reality. But the freedom she thought she had discovered, little by little becomes no more than loneliness, lies, and characters who, as she, one day escaped. Is it too late to return to her previous life? Is it possible to run away from one-self?
