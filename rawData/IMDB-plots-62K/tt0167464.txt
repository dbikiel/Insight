A boy shyly watches a girl on a tram. Only when he exits the tram, and its too late, does he realize that he must meet her.
A silent film. On a winter night, a young man stands apart at a club while others dance. He leaves, running to catch a tram. He notices a young woman sitting by herself. They make eye contact. He watches her as she looks away. He busies himself and chews a sugar cube; she smiles, then closes her eyes. He wonders what to do. He reaches his stop. Has he missed a life-changing chance?
