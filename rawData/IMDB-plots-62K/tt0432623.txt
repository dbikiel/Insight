On a fine winter morning, an aristocratic couple of city dwellers decide to have a picnic in the great outdoors, however, everything seems to go wrong, all at once.
Never again a picnic in the woods for theirs! This one disastrous experience has been enough to cure our friends of any longing they might have fur jaunts in the country. They expected to rough it, but never dreamed they would be compelled to put up with the hardships that they suffered on this pleasure trip. In the first place, when they opened their carefully prepared lunch, they found it crawling with all sorts of worms, etc., and then to add to their troubles, a shower comes on, and, possessing but one umbrella, they naturally get good and wet. On reaching the hotel, they finally expect to get a little rest, but as they seek a little slumber the most terrible nightmares disturb their repose until they finally decide to give it up as a bad job, and hasten back to town, perfect wrecks after their day with Nature.
On a fine winter morning, an aristocratic couple of city dwellers along with their servants decide to have a picnic in the great outdoors to enjoy the freshness of the open air. However, much to their surprise, everything seems to go wrong, as decay, disgusting little critters and the caprices of nature, all strike at once the hapless excursionists. Moreover, as if this isn't enough, more surprises await them at the inn, where perplexing illusions and disturbing nightmares rob them of their peace. Perhaps, next time, the unaware couple should think twice before taking such a risk.
