200 BC. During a merciless drought, the brute nature of man and the delicate essence of woman become inextricably intertwined, as the omnipotence of the carnal instinct demands the total surrender of the flesh.
Parallel stories of Eros set in 200 B.C. Nomadic shepherds, plagued by drought, happen on a fishing encampment with plentiful fresh water. The local men are away but will return when it rains; the shepherds stay to refresh their flock until the rain comes. A shepherd lad and a local girl, both on the verge of puberty, start a mating dance. Also, one of the shepherds approaches a beautiful local woman, inviting her to sleep with him. How will she respond? She's married, her husband at sea for the week. Is love forever or temporary? A subtext dramatizes the capture of fish, birds, foxes, and other animals: their fates seem arbitrary.
In the old book, the year is 200 BC. Towards the end of a rainless and unending summer, a merciless drought persists in hammering the needy soil. Under the scorching sun, the shepherds' nomadic tribe camp close to one of the remaining wells, as the scanty remnants of the fishermen's clan--women young, and old--embrace the ephemeral heat on the opposite side of the village. This pair of literal and metaphorical antipodes--the brute nature of man, and the delicate essence of woman--are invisibly and inextricably intertwined, as the omnipotence of man's carnal instinct will soon demand the total surrender of the flesh. Inevitably, against the backdrop of life's perpetual and allegorical fragments--the fervent adolescence; the irrevocable impulsive choices; the carnivorous lust, and the desperate prayers for rain--one is the mightiest power in the Universe that binds us all: Love.
