Reidar is a resident at Solih√∏gda psychiatric institution. He is expecting the Earth to be hit by a huge meteor any time now, but until then he is busy trying to keep his fellow patient, Juni, from killing herself. And it doesn't happen often. But maybe one is allowed to hope. That when the quarks in the ball are correctly aligned with the quarks in the wall that you throw it at, there won't be a collision. But a moment of harmony when everything is balanced. And that moment could be now.
