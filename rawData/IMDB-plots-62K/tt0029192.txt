An elderly couple are forced to separate when they lose their house and none of their five children will take both parents in.
At a family reunion, the Cooper clan find that their parents' home is being foreclosed. "Temporarily," Ma moves in with son George's family, Pa with daughter Cora. But the parents are like sand in the gears of their middle-aged children's well regulated households. Can the old folks take matters into their own hands?
An elderly couple, Lucy and Barkley Cooper, need a place to live after the bank forecloses on the mortgage. None of their five adult children will take both of them in however and are forced to live separately. It's all supposed to be a temporary arrangement for three months or so until the children can arrange something more permanent. Lucy goes to live with her son George but she always seems to be in the way, especially when George's wife Anita is teaching her bridge class. Barkley goes to live with his daughter Cora, who obvious resents his very presence and arranges for him to go live in California with another of his children. Lucy and Barkley do their best to maintain their dignity all the while.
