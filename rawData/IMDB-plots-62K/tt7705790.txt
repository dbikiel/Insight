A love story that weathers time and emotions. Aditya sees Varsha and it is love at first sight for him. What transpires over the next 7 years is what makes their love stronger.
The story follows the life of a guy called Aditya who didn't have anything to look forward to in life until Varsha came along. A classic case of love at first sight but it was short lived as she exited the scene only to return later. But from the looks of it, it's not going to be an easy love story as they have to face hurdles on the way. The film's underlining tagline is - Memories, whether good or bad stay with us always.
