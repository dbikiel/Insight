Despite their fighting on opposite sides during the Civil War, brothers Vance and Jeb Britton have to set their differences aside in order to survive an Indian attack.
Two brothers who are not the best friends because they were fighting on different sides during the Civil War have to cooperate in order to defend themselves against an attack of indians.
Confederate officer Vance Britten (Ronald Reagan) and his Texas unit are sent to the Arizona territory to halt the supply of gold to the Union army, while Vance's brother, Jeb Britten (Bruce Bennett), is the Union cavalry officer charged with seeing that the shipment get through. Some of the Union supporters try to enlist the aid of the Apache tribe against the Southerners but Vance, knowing that the Apaches would be a danger to all the people in the territory, persuades the Apaches not to become involved in the conflict between the states. A renegade kills the Apache chief, causing an uprising that forces the two army units to band together in a common cause.
At the Last Outpost an officer in the Union Army has just met the beautiful redhead who was once engaged to his brother, an officer in the Confederate Army. She is at present unhappily married to the owner of the trading post but will soon be a widow. Add to this Apache Indians, an intercepted gold shipment and a special expediter coming from Washington. And those Conferederate guerillas who have been so troublesome on the Western front of the Civil War are led by the long lost brother and former fiance and future president of the USA.
