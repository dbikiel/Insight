The story of a pair of Australian pilots working for a small South Pacific airline. Paul, a wildly successful womanizer, leaving conquests at every port and Martin, sad and lonely in his search for a true love. Together, they... well, they don't do much of anything besides chase girls on various Polynesian islands.
