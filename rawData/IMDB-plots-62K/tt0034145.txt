Inspector Fernack asks Simon to watch over an old friend who's carrying $200,000 worth of postage stamps, but the friend is killed, and the stamps stolen.
Fernack tries to get Simon arrested as he returns home from a Transatlantic European vacation in order to help old friend and World War I hero Peter Johnson travel safely to Palm Springs in order to deliver $200,000, which has been converted into three rare stamps, to his daughter. While Simon is protecting him in New York, Johnson is murdered in his own apartment, but the killer is unable to get the stamps. The Saint brings them himself to the resort but is assaulted by a gang of foreign agents who steal the stamps. Johnson's beautiful daughter Elna doesn't believe Simon's story but gives him 24 hours to get them back before reporting him to the California authorities. Along with old friend Pearly Gates, a reformed pickpocket turned hotel house detective, they sift through many red herrings to uncover the stamps and the murderer.
