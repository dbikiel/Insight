The retired dentist Caroline attends a class for computer users. Although she is married, she falls in love with her significantly younger lecturer. It turns out he used to visit her surgery because primarily in order to enjoy her view. Her husband finds out about her affair with this admirer.
A depressed woman has prematurely retired from her dentistry career. Her grown daughters and her husband seem helpful on the surface, but in reality are taking her for granted, just going about their own preoccupied lives, no longer seeing her for who she is. That is until by chance she meets someone who ignites a sense of her higher self, puts a smile on her face, but also highlights her neurosis. Though her insecurities are doomed to traumatize this beautiful but fragile bond, it non the less lifts her depression, inspires her to rekindle her career, and gives her the insight to be that transcendent creature to her spouse; transforming him before our very eyes from a dullard, to a sexy man full of life and plans.
