A taboo-smasher of the late '60s, featuring interracial affairs, anti-Vietnam statements, violence versus sex. Take a whirlwind trip with a married woman whose journey through the psychedelic English youth scene awakens her to the carnal offerings of an African-American man, all set to a searing soundtrack by Freedom, a tripped-out group formed from the remnants of Procol Harum.
