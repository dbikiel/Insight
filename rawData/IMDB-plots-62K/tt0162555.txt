A private investigator (nicknamed Octopus after his long arms) travels to the small town of Angernaud with his bisexual girlfriend to collect the money he spent for the reconstruction of his family grave after it was vandalized by a group of young people. He seeks them out one by one but every time he finds the person dead. When he learns that a drunkard Scotsman, a local celebrity and an extreme right politician are involved in the mysterious deaths and all signs lead to a boat in the harbor, he calls in his sidekick Pedro for reinforcement.
