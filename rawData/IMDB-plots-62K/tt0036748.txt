A heroic guerilla group fights back against impossible odds during the 1941 Nazi invasion of Russia.
In late 1941, with the Nazi invasion of Russia still advancing, the Red Army leaves bands of guerillas behind in the forests. One such band is joined by beautiful ballet dancer Nina; initially inept, a series of bitter lessons gradually make her a seasoned soldier. The group still form human attachments, despite the shadow of grim death that makes their greatest hope one of selling their lives dearly...
On their advance on the Russian front, the Nazis stay primarily on the main roads because of the large number of Russian guerrillas staked out in remote areas ready to attack. Vladimir leads one such group of guerrillas, who are based in an underground bunker in the forest, and who as a collective span demographics: young/old, males/females. Their primary goal is to hinder the Nazi advance in any way possible, which includes killing Nazis, and gathering and providing intel to Russian troops. Into their midst comes renowned ballerina Nina, who was on her way to entertain Russian troops, but who got separated from her entourage. Her presence causes some issue among the guerrillas: some of the men, especially young Mitya, are enthralled with her as a woman, but everyone realizes that she has no skills upon which to help them - including not being able to do any of the domestic duties in the bunker - and as such should leave as soon as possible. But as time progresses, Nina herself begins to have strong feelings for what she can accomplish as a guerrilla, especially as she has fallen in love with Vladimir, and he with her. The question becomes whether Vladimir and Nina's relationship compromises the effectiveness of the group, especially in Vladimir's decision making when it involves Nina.
