In the weeks before the 2016 general election, Oscar-winning filmmaker Michael Moore performs a pro-Hillary Clinton stand-up show deep in the heart of TrumpLand.
Oscar-winner Michael Moore dives deep in the heart of hostile TrumpLand territory with his daring, profound, and uproarious one-man show. When the show gets banned from the first town they tried, Mike moves on to an even bigger community of Trump supporters in the ironically-named Clinton County, Ohio. Performed, shot, and edited just weeks before the 2016 election, this heartfelt, honest, and hilarious concert film is essential election viewing for a divided America. With a title like Michael Moore in TrumpLand, you may think you know what's in store, but the film is sure to surprise. Entertaining, outraging, and informing in equal measure, no matter who you're voting for, this movie has something for everybody.
