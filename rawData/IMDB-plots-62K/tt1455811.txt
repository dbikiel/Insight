A seemingly corrupt petty contractor faces challenges from the local municipality, his family, his employees, as well as a former girlfriend and her family.
Satara-based petty road-works contractor, Sachin Tichkule, faces challenges when the Satara Municipal Corporation puts a hold on his payment. He decides to sue them, while his extended family deal with the crisis of a recently-collapsed bridge resulting in 65 deaths. If matters were not bad enough, the new Municipal Commissioner is none other than his estranged girlfriend/ex-collegian, Gehna Ganpule. Sachin had abused and assaulted her in Mumbai a few years ago, and she is now determined to blacklist him at any and all costs. While comically dealing with indolent employees, his sister's marriage, an elephant, a road-roller &amp;c. he lands in even more hot water when the local police get ready to prosecute him for alleged Sexual Molestation, as well as Assault and Threats to Kill Gehna's brother.
The film revolves around a struggling road constructor, Sachin Tichkule (Akshay Kumar). He dreams big but there seems to be no chance of his dreams coming true as he doesn't have any money to bribe the babus. To make matters worse, the new municipal commissioner turns to be his former girl friend, Ganpule Madam (Trisha Krishnan), who now hates him. Even as Sachin stumbles from one disaster to another, the film brings to the fore the extent of corruption that's rampant in the system.
