Phileas Fogg III, great grandson of the original Phileas Fogg, accepts a bet to duplicate his great grandfather's famous trip around the world in response to a challenge made by Randolph Stuart III, the descendant of the original Fogg's nemesis. Unbeknownst to anyone, However, "Stuart" is the infamous con man Vicker Cavendish who made the bet in order to cover up his robbing the bank of England by framing Fogg for the crime. This makes for a dangerous journey for Fogg and his servants (the stooges) and Amelia Carter, whom they rescue from thugs during a train ride. Can they make it back to England in time ?
Phileas Fogg III, grandson of the famous adventurer who went around the world in 80 days, accepts a challenge to repeat the feat only this time without the use of any money. The bet is Â£20,000 and Fogg has side bets for the same amount. Accompanied by his servants, the Three Stooges, they set off eastward through Turkey, India, South-East Asia, Japan, the United States and Canada making their way back to London with many zany adventures along the way. Fogg is also wanted by the police as a rather large sum of money was stolen the same day he departed. They arrive in London on the 81st day and he has apparently lost the bet. Or has he?
