Vulnerable and impressionable teenage girl continues to experience sorrows and joys of adult life.
Two years after the first "Boum", Vic - now 15 and a half years old - has a very calm love life, actually no boyfriend at all. Her parents are happily together again, Grandma Poupette thinks about finally marring her long-term boyfriend. But then Vic meets Philippe and is overcome by his charm. She's in heaven again and considers going all the way this time - a step, that her girlfriend Penelope already has taken.
Two years after La Boum, the Beretton family goes on, with a few changes: François leaves the lucrative dental clinic to dedicate himself to lab research, his wife Françoise progresses from cartoonist to animation movies, and they have a new child, that brings new happiness and worries. Vic has matured into a 15-year-old, in the confusion of finding and dealing with her first love.
