An obsessed fan and his mother kidnap former 'scream queens' and force them to reenact their famous film roles...with deadly results.
It's the present day, and our heroines, real life Scream Queens who starred in those infamous movies back in the 80's and 90's, have gone on with their lives since those days, some still acting or in new businesses of their own. What none of them suspect is that somewhere, down in the basement of an old house, an obsessed fan, Max, sits in the dark, watching clips from those movies over and over, his obsession growing into a diabolical plan. One by one, with his mother's help, he begins to "collect" them, transporting them to a makeshift prison he's set up in his basement. The Scream Queens have no idea what's going on, until they find themselves forced to reenact movie scenes from their horror heyday, a nightmarish process since Max remembers every line and gesture and they haven't watched them in years. And they definitely don't remember the new and terrible outcome of the scenes...
