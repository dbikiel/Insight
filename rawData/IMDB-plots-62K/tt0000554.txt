A cartoonist draws faces and figures on a blackboard - and they come to life.
Considered the first truly animated movie (or at least the first verifiable, surviving animation), this film is based on the lightning-sketch, a popular vaudeville act. The artist (Blackton) draws a series of faces on a blackboard, which then seem to take on a life of their own.
Against the backdrop of a dusty chalkboard, British-American director, producer, and illustrator for the New York Evening World, J. Stuart Blackton, uses stop-motion and cut-out animation techniques to bring to life a series of comical hand-drawn scenes. Considered to be the first animation picture recorded on standard film stock, Blackton's influential short which comes six years after the equally innovational, The Enchanted Drawing (1900), mixes the graceful frolics of a happy circus clown and his playful French poodle, with the suffocating effects of cigar smoking. Sometimes, the artist's hand gets in the way; however, that, too, is part of the show. How many phases of funny faces can you count?
