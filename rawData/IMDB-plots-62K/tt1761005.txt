An evangelist finds himself framed for murder and on the run after he refuses to back a senator's proposition calling for sweeping religious reform.
Nationally acclaimed evangelist John Luther is the last obstacle in the way of sweeping religious reform in the States. When a U.S. Senator and Luther's own supporters abduct and frame him in the murder of an innocent teenage girl, an unprecedented era of persecution is unleashed. Out on personal recognizance, Luther escapes police surveillance in search of the truth. And suddenly a once-normal life is targeted by a team of ex-military operatives who wage a relentless campaign to eliminate the incriminating evidence. As evangelist turned fugitive, Luther vows to expose anyone involved with, or profiting from, the girl's murder. It's a mission that brings him face-to-face with the coming storm of persecution that will threaten the entire American Christian community.
The winds of religious reform are blowing through the United States, but influential preacher John Luther (James Remar) is the one man who stands in the way of progress. As a result, Lusko incurs the wrath of a sinister U.S. senator, who turns the pastor into a media pariah by kidnapping him and implicating him in the murder of a teenage girl. Meanwhile, Luther plots to expose those who are exploiting the innocent girl's death for profit, and learns that America's Christian community will soon face mass persecution..
Oh the travails of being a white-heterosexual-Christian-male in the United States. The persecution is endless. Are we being tested?
