An undercover DEA agent brings down the Mafia.
An undercover DEA agent almost gets killed, and to continue with his mission he needs to attend group therapy.
On the outside, undercover DEA agent Charlie Mayheaux is cool, calm, in control; inside, he's nervous, fearful, flatulent. He's embedded in a double play to bring down a Colombian cartel and a New York City mob family, but his supervisor won't let him stage an arrest until huge sums of money are on the table. Everyone carries guns, and the NYC negotiator is a sociopath who shoots off the testicle of the cartel leader's lover. A psychiatrist sends Charlie to group therapy, and he starts dating the nurse who gives him an enema at a G.I. clinic. She advocates homeopathic remedies and looking on the bright side. With murder, showdowns, and back-stabbing, can there be a bright side?
