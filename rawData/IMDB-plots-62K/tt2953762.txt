"My verdict is : I, Olga Hepnarov치, the victim of your bestiality, sentence you to death penalty." Those were the famous words of the 22-year-old mass murderer Olga Hepnarov치, who in 1973 drove a truck into a group of innocent people in Prague.
Alienated, bullied, and raised in a strict family environment in Prague, the timid by nature and troubled child without any friends, Olga Hepnarov치, nurtures a raging hatred towards an indifferent and faceless society. However, under those circumstances, pretty soon, Olga will find herself trapped in the middle of a war she can't win, utterly defeated by the same element she's been trying to avoid: its people. Now, more and more, Olga feels rejected by everyone--and as a silent but meticulously prepared plot becomes her only means of retribution--her odious circle, her apathetic family, and the rest of the world are not safe. Will she ever find peace of mind?
Olga Hepnarov치 was a young, lonely lesbian outsider from a coldhearted family who couldn't play the part society desired of her. Her paranoid self-examination and inability to connect with other people eventually drove her over the edge of humanity when she was only twenty-two years old.The film shows the human being behind the mass murderer without glorifying or downplaying the terrible crime she committed. Guided by her letters we delve into Olga's psyche and witness the worsening of her loneliness and alienation as we reconstruct the events that led up to her disastrous actions.
Although the story is set in the 1970s, young people worldwide today still face problems of not belonging, being different, and being bullied because of race, gender or sexual orientation.
