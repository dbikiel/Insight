An escaped convict tracks down the cop who put him away.
When detective Sean Walker's partner is brutally murdered by psychotic killer Billy during a drug bust gone wrong, Sean nearly executes Billy himself. Traumatized by his friend's death and disgusted by internal politics, Sean quits the Las Vegas police force and moves his beautiful wife and young daughter to an isolated ranch. After ten years in prison, Billy escapes and sets out to get even with the cop who put him away. He hooks up with his sadistic girlfriend Sadie and the two set out in search of Sean, leaving a trail of dead bodies in their wake. Clueless, Sean's former colleagues call him in to help. As Sean tracks the escaped killer, Billy and Sadie close in on the ranch. By the time Sean realizes where Billy's trail leads, his wife, teenage daughter, and their sexy traveling companion Michelle, have been taken hostage. While waiting for Sean to arrive, Billy and Sadie indulge their perverse appetites with the helpless prisoners. Racing against time, Sean must act alone to save his family from the brutal killers bent on revenge.
