A colorful fairy tale about a little wooden boy Buratino and his quest for the Golden Key that opens a secret door.
The wooden little man, whom Papa Carlo scraped out of logs, turned out to be cheerful, cocky, noisy and gullible. Fox Alice and Cat Basilio brought him to the Land of Fools, but the wise Turtle Tortilla helped Buratino find the Golden Key, because he was terribly charming.
