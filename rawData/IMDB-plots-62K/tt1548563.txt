The galaxy songstress Sheryl Nome, Ranka Lee, Alto Saotome and friends are traveling space along with the New Macross class ship -Macross Frontier- that contains 10 million citizens in search for new planets in which humankind can develop and progress. The perils of space are vast as itself, the threat from the alien insect-like race Vajra will push all Macross Frontier fleet to an edge, is this the ultimate humankind enemy, or is there something even worse in space. Music and songs will prove one of the most valuable human assets in the space even more powerful than combat VF Mechs, as it can reach not only humans but the space and beyond.
