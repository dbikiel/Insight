A shepherd falls in love with an English tourist in Greece.
Under the scorching summer sun of a remote Greek village, the flaxen-haired British tourist, Annabel, has a chance encounter with an unrefined but well-meaning shepherd. As one thing leads to another, the sheepherder's honest offer to give Annabel a handful of sweet almonds rapidly escalates into a clumsy misinterpretation, throwing the innocent gentle giant behind bars. However, against the backdrop of a preposterous accusation and a daunting language barrier, little by little, a timid friendship starts to develop, paving the way for unprecedented feelings and the palpable tingling sensation of first love. But, now that the reclusive herder bashfully explores the wonders of a sun-kissed romance, a long and hot summer draws to a close, and Annabel has to return home. Will they ever see each other again?
