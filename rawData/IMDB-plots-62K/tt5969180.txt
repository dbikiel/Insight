Nick, writer of "I Hate Kids", is getting married when 13 y.o. Mason claims to be his son. A psychic and DNA tests prove it. Mason was adopted and doesn't know his real mom. Nick and co. visit all his girlfriends/flings 14 years ago.
Nick Pearson is a life-long bachelor who is finally settling down. On the brink of his wedding he is surprised to find he has a 13 year old son who has come to find him through the help of a psychic. The problem is Nick can't stand kids and would happily send the boy back to live with his biological mother, except that no one has any clue who that might be. Having nowhere to turn, Nick must hit the road with the boy and the neurotic, inept psychic to track down dozens of his disgraced ex-flings to whom he must ask the awkward question - with very mixed results.
