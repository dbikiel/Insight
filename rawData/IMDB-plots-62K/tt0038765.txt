A recent widow meets an army major while skiing and despite pressures from friends and family becomes romantically involved with him.
Tongues begin to wag when a lonely widow becomes romantically involved with a military man. Problems arise when the gossip is filtered down to her own children.
Jessica Drummond is a recent widow whose husband died after a long illness. Drained by the ordeal, she is vulnerable and lonely but avoids becoming romantically involved with her family attorney despite pressure from her domineering mother. After fending off the lascivious advances of a friend's husband, she goes away during the Christmas holidays to a friend's vacation cabin. While skiing there she meets and falls in love with Scott Landis, an army major on leave. Family and friends view the relationship as inappropriate and gossip turns into a chorus of disapproval.
