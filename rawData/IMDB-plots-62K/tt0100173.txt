A young girl who wants a mom for the Christmas holidays gets her wish when a department store mannequin comes to life.
Jessie is a young girl who's mother died when she was just three. When she wins a free wish in a department store she wishes for a mom to be with and to shop with over the holidays. Her wish brings Amy, a mannequin, to life and into her life as her Mom for Christmas.
The story revolves around 11-year-old Jessica (Juliet Sorcey), whose mother died when she was three years old. Her father, Jim (Doug Sheehan), is a workaholic with little time for his daughter and hasn't been able to spend time with her since her mother's death 8 years prior and still seems to be mourning her. Just before the Christmas holiday season, Jessica wins a free wish from a wishing well. Her wish for a mother for Christmas is granted by Philomena (Doris Roberts) and Amy (Olivia Newton-John), a department store mannequin, is brought to life to be a mom for Jessica. However, there is a catch and Amy can only be a mother to her until Christmas Eve.
