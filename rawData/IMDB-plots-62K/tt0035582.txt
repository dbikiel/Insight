When Laurie goes to the execution of Varney and faints, she does not know that Varney gets a full pardon minutes before he fries. She calls in a story about his death and gets transferred to the Bewildered Heart Column of Prudence Maddox. When Mitch writes a story about Greer murdering Crowder that he cannot prove, he gets transferred from editor to Prudence Maddox. He makes Prudence very profitable for the paper, but the only way he can get the job of editor back, is to prove that Greer is a crook.
