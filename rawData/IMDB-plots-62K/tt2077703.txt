Love stories in Yopougon, a neighborhood of the Ivory Coast capital.
In warm Ivory Coast's working-class district of Abidjan or Yop City, the nineteen-year-old aspiring doctor, Aya, dreams of finishing her studies despite her father's opposition. But, Aya lives in a poor West African township during the 1970s, where getting married to a rich man and starting a family is every girl's aspiration--at least, that's what Aya's best friends, Bintou and Adjoua, are hoping for. Under Yopougon's bright sun, three girls, three different destinies and three parallel lives intertwine, as life keeps going. Will Aya's ambitions ever come true?
