Corinna Kleist is a juvenile court judge who, after a leave of absence following the suicide of a convicted teenager, is appointed to a 'problem area' in Berlin. She now tries harder than ever to change the system in order to prevent troubled kids from being turned into vicious criminals. In the case of 14-year-old Rafiq, she becomes particiularly emotionally involved and goes far beyond what her duty as a judge calls for - the lonely and often hopeless struggle of a courageous woman trying to do the right thing... Based on the book Das Ende der Geduld, written by Kirsten Heisig.
