A young working girl, trying to find a way to get a seat on the subway, takes along a baby doll to insure a way. She ends up getting stuck in a thick plot to sell an ad to a rich client who thinks her doll is a real baby named after him. Her male co-workers try to keep her playing "mother" until they can get a contract for the ad.
