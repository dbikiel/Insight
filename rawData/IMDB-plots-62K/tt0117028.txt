In August 1970 600,000 fans flocked to the Isle of Wight to witness the third and final festival to be held on the island.

They also witnessed the final, drugged out performance of Jimi Hendrix in England just two weeks before he would meet a tragic death. When it all was over, the fans view of rock and roll was never the same.
