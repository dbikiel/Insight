"Intimate Parts" is an ironic melodrama about middle-class Muscovites. Each of them has a personal secret, hidden from others - the "intimate part". The main character, a scandalous photographer Ivan, juxtaposes himself to others. He is convinced that people are born to be happy; and happiness is freedom to stay true to one's self. The real question is: how safe is it to let your inner self out?
