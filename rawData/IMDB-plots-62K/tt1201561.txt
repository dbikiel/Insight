Join Barbie in an all-new world of Butterfly Fairies! When the Queen falls ill, it's up to brave Mariposa and her friends to journey beyond the safe borders of the city to find a cure.
Surrounded by Queen Marabella's shimmering magical lights, the island-kingdom of Flutterfield in the wondrous land of Fairytopia is completely protected from the clutches of the Skeezites--a tribe of ravenous nocturnal monsters. However, when the queen's envious and remorseless attendant, Henna, decides to take over the entire kingdom, the precious lights that keep safe the helpless and fragile fairies will start to flicker. Now, in grave danger of being left unprotected, the courageous butterfly-fairy, Mariposa, and her loyal fairy-friends, Rayna and Rayla, will have to undertake a perilous journey far away from Fairytopia's protective boundaries, in search of a potent antidote. United, they are strong. Will the brave fairies manage to save the land and their beloved ruler?
