True story of a brand-new Canadian airliner running out of fuel in-flight and forced to glide to the nearest airfield.
It's the summer of 1983. Canada World Airways' brand-new Boeing 767 leaves Montreal bound for Edmonton. When the plane reaches its cruise altitude, the impossible happens: the plane runs out of fuel, due to a miscalculation by the ground staff in Montreal. Captain Bob Pearson and First Officer Maurice Quintal face a potentially deadly disaster in this true story, as the 767, with about 60 souls on board, slowly falls from the sky.
