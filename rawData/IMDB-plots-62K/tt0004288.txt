The swindler follows the distribution of the paper containing his 'scoop' around town where he is once again chased by the rival reporter. Both end up on the cow-catcher of a streetcar.
A con man makes his living by using properties of others to gain profitable positions for himself. He persuades a gentleman to give him a ring, and then rushes off to a wealthy young lady, who he courts and gives the ring.

The gentleman recognizes the ring and tries to explain the situation, but the woman doesn't believe him. After a fight between the two men, the gentleman is thrown out by a valet. Some hours later the gentleman happens to witness a car crash. This is his chance to become a reporter at the local newspaper, and he takes some photos of the crash, before helping other people to save the driver. In the turmoil the con man steals the camera. The gentleman runs after him, but gets entangled in fights with other persons, and the con man slips away. He rushes off to the local newspaper, where he sells the photos of the crash. When the gentleman tries to stop it, the photos are already in print in the paper.
