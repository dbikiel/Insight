When his ward seeks protection with rival cattleman John Stewart, embittered, jealous rancher Wick Campbell hires ten outlaws to help him seize power in the territory.
When John Stewart gives refuge to Wick Campbell's girl friend, Campbell turns against him. He rustles Stewart's cattle, murders his brother, and brings in hired guns. Then he and his men pin Stewart and a few others down in a house apparently killing them. But Stewart has escaped and returns alone to rid the town of Campbell and his men.
The rancher, John Stewart, welcomes his brother and lawyer, Adam, and his nephew, Howie, who have just arrived in Ocatilla to implement law, with a party at his ranch. Howie flirts with a Mexican girl, Maria Segura, but the greedy Wick Campbell who raised her since she was orphan tries to force her to live with him. John Stewart protects Maria and so she moves to his ranch. Campbell hires ten gunmen to work for him. He first kills John's neighbor about to re-pay a debt in order to claim his lands. Then he rustles John's cattle using the gunmen, frames Howie in a duel in the bar and he is arrested; and kills Adam Stewart on a lonely road. When Campbell believes he has destroyed John Stewart, the outlaws turn against him and loot Ocatilla. But John Stewart has other plans.
