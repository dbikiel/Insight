The true story of Gwen Araujo, a young trans woman who was brutally murdered by four men in 2002.
Based on a true story. As a young boy, Eddie Araujo always felt different somehow. She started putting on her mom's makeup and wearing her mom's clothes, which her mom found odd. By the time she entered her teen years, Eddie could no longer hide the fact that she was a lot different, that she was meant to be female and not male. When she finally accepted it and with her mom's eventual support, Eddie changed her name to Gwen and started to live life as female until a tragic night changed everything.
In this movie, Gwen Araujo was born Eddie Araujo. But as she got older she started seeing that she was more of a female then a male. So she changed her name to Gwen when she was in high school and she was no longer a male. When she was 17 years old she was killed by 3 teenage boys after they discovered she was a male. They beat her for 5 hours before tying her up and throwing her in a grave. Two of the boys were convicted of second-degree murder, and one boy plead out to manslaughter. The judge and jury did not see this as a hate crime and none of the boys were convicted of one.
