A single father struggles with the education of his two daughters and his two jobs until he's forced by a social investigator to attend parenting classes.
Denis Patar is an affectionate father, but with an excess of work, who struggles just to get his daughters forward, Janis 13 years old and Mercredi 9 years old. One night he forgets to pick up one of them at school and a social worker is given the task of investigating the functioning of the Patar family. Denis is forced to take a "paternity course" to avoid losing custody of his daughters. An endearing portrait of an unusual family.
