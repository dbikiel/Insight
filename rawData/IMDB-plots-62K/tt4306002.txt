Games- and gambling-obsessed king Wilbur is all but amused when his heiress daughter Ella agrees to wed street musician Jasper, who is flushed into the dungeon for subjects who didn't let the king win, witches and alleged criminals. Ella gets a forged letter claiming Jasper change his mind, but he escapes and teams up with five other weird-gifted fellow outcasts: strong man Lukas, infallible shooter Benjamin, tornado-speedy Markus, plants witch Flora and frost-breathing Lisa. Jasper masquerades as a count to wager against the realm's never-beaten runner Theodor the princess' hand. The king keeps cheating, and his whole palace is equipped for it.
