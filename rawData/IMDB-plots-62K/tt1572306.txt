the movie, is an edge of the seat thriller,the first sign something is wrong is when one driver states, "we haven't passed a single car going the opposite direction" once they arrive at their destination, no one is there, it is deserted, baths run, no one there, a baby's milk bottle, made up no one there a hot pan on a stove no one there, hot water tap running no one there, 2 messages written at start of movie, DON'T BLINK written on mirror, HELP ME written on the inside of cupboard door, no one there, one by one they disappear, a fridge door opens, as a character stands behind it, as the door closes the character is gone, they try to run, the driver of car disappears leaving a frantic passenger, a character is shot, dragged the front door screaming, until the screaming stops, he is gone, a suicide from shooting, body covered in blood sat in seat, minutes later, the body is gone, and so to is all his blood until one is left and the emergency services arrive.........
the ending is some what of a mystery as WHY the people disappeared is left to your imagination,
movie 10 out of 10, the ending 0 out of 10 if you love mysteries you will love this movie, if you love thrillers you will love this movie, if you love horrors ................... sorry, this one isn't for you, i, myself really enjoyed the movie but the ending, leaves you wondering, can we expect, a DON'T BLINK 2 i think, there will be as the disappearances need to be explained or the second movie may be a prequel to how the first people disappeared,
