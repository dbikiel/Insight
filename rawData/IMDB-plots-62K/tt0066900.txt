An outlaw tries to avoid interference as he journeys to Mexico to pull off a $2,000,000 gold robbery.
Marshall Cowan and the mercenary Miller are both separately hunting the outlaw Catlow. During the Civil War both Cowan and the always smiling Catlow were comrades. Catlow helps Cowan, when he is wounded in the right leg by an arrow from the Apaches, despite Cowan hunting him. Catlow escapes with help of his gang. Catlow then robs a Mexican gold shipment, worth $ 2,000,000. Catlow flees with the stolen gold through the dangerous territory of the Apaches who, besides Miller, Cowan and the Mexican cavalry, are hunting for him and his gang of outlaws.
After the end of the costly American Civil War, the best friends, Jed Catlow and Ben Cowan, took separate paths, with Catlow now a free-spirited outlaw, and Cowan, a U.S. Marshall who half-heartedly pursues him for stealing cattle. With such a reputation, everyone is after the fast-drawing Catlow, including the Apaches, the vengeful bounty hunter, Miller, and the entire Mexican Army for stealing a $2 million shipment of gold. But who's going to have the pleasure of putting the tough Catlow behind bars?
