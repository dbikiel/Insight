Fleeing a murder charge, a busboy and a nightclub singer wind up on a spooky Caribbean island inherited by an heiress.
Nightclub singer Larry Todd breaks off his romance with a beautiful showgirl when he realizes she's the girlfriend of a murderously jealous gangster. While on the run, Larry mistakenly believes he kills one of the mobsters and is helped to escape police by heiress Mary Carol, who smuggles Larry and partner Myron to Cuba. Mary has inherited a haunted castle on an isolated island and, ignoring ominous warnings and threats, decides to take possession. While there, the trio hunt for a hidden treasure and encounter a ghost, a zombie, and a mysterious killer.
Close remake of Ghost Breakers (1940) starring Paulette Goddard, Bob Hope and Willie Best as Hope's valet and a very young Anthony Quinn as the Mederes brothers (Cariso in the remake).Mary Carter (Lizabeth Scott) inherits her family's ancestral home, located on a small island off Cuba, and, despite warnings and death threats, decides to sail to Havana and take possession of the reputedly haunted castle. She is joined by nightclub entertainer Larry Todd (Dean Martin) who, believing he has killed a mobster, flees New York with a friend, Alex. Once on the island the three enter the eerie castle and, after viewing the ghost of one of Mary's ancestors and fighting off a menacing zombie, find the key to the castle's treasure.In Scared Stiff (1953) broadcaster Larry (Hope) becomes a nightclub entertainer and his valet Alex (Willie Best) changes into a friend. If you like Jerry Lewis (I dont) you may enjoy his impersonation of Carmen Miranda and the rest of the remake, but I think everybody in the original, with the exception of Dean Martin, did a better job in a better film.Written by Doug Sederberg {vornoff@sonic.net} and jojo.acaplco@gmail.com
