During school-break, two kids are to stay with their rich Granpa but they would rather join their mother overseas, so, in need of plane-ticket cash, they convince two petty-criminals to fake-kidnap them for a ransom they could all share.
After finding out that their mother is going to be working through another school holiday, two children are shipped to spend the holiday with their Grandfather. On their way to their Grandfather, the children decide to fly to see their mother in Hong Kong instead but they need money for tickets. They accidentally run into two criminals at the airport and end up in a taxi with them. At the criminal's hideout, the children decide to send a ransom note to their Grandfather to fund their flight to Hong Kong and help the criminals pay a debt. Shenanigans ensue and like O. Henry's novel, of "The Ransom of Red Chief" the ransom decreases as time passes.
Shortly after their someone left them beside a boarding school building, they immediately decide to do anything and prevent or postpone a majority of their time-to-be at a boarding school. They got two would-be safe-crackers to nab the two rascal siblings, of a sister and her brother. They are grandchildren of millionaire, J. W. Osborne. In a story that is very reminiscent of O. Henry's novel, of "The Ransom of Red Chief". Their ransom amount changes, keeps getting smaller (instead of larger), as the two children have their best vacation and prevent their usual yearly boarding school ever. They got the would be safe-crackers to nab them, shortly after the movies Opening Music Credits concluded when a lady left them by the boarding school building and drove away.
