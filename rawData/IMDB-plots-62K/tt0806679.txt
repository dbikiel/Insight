At 40, Miriam radiates serene beauty and tranquility, a confidence and self-assurance as vast as the sea close to her summer home. There are no taboos in the polished, urbane life she shares with her partner Andr√© and their 15-year-old son Nils; there is understanding and tolerance.

But when the brazenly sensual Livia begins flirting with an older man, Bill, Miriam feels it is her responsibility to stop the questionable relationship.

And suddenly the vast horizons of her life vanish in a fog of jealousy and rejection - emotions that prove to be far less controllable than she thought...
