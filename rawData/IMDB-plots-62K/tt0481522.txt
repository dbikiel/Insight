Flight 93 is the story of the heroic passengers that took back their plane in an effort to stop a 9-11 terrorist attack.
On September 11th 2001, four domestic flights are hijacked by terrorists in the United States of America. After the collision of three against selected targets, the passengers and crew of United Airlines Flight 93 fight against four terrorists to take back the control of the airplane.
In this dramatization, unsuspecting passengers of United Airlines Flight 93 board the aircraft on the fateful morning of Sept. 11, 2001. After three other planes strike their intended targets, Al-Qaeda terrorists on Flight 93 make their move, threatening the passengers into submission by claiming to have an explosive onboard. But calls to loved ones reveal the truth, and the passengers -- including Todd Beamer and Tom Burnett -- plan to take back the flight.
