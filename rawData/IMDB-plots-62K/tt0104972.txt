Adel is a young criminal who frequently teams up with his middle-aged wife Afagh in order to carry out the most audacious schemes. But when Adel falls in love with Narges, he realises he is quite prepared to start a new life on the right side of the law. Posing as his mother, Afagh assures the bride's family that Adel is reliable, but his criminal record closes most doors in his attempts to secure a legitimate career path. Trapped in a love triangle and in the limbo of a double life, can Adel ever achieve the better future for which he is striving ?
A sharp-edged look at people who live outside the constraints of Islamic law. In her fourth feature, director Rakhshan Bani-Etemad tells the tragic story of a love triangle. Afagh, an aging thief who has lost her beauty, is on the verge of losing her young lover, Adel. When Adel meets the beautiful Nargess, he decides to go straight, but honest work does not come easily, and he decides to go back to the old life for one last job. "Bani-Etemad pushes the Iranian censorship code to the limit, managing to make her outsider characters believable and moving" (Deborah Young, Variety). Farsi with English subtitles.
