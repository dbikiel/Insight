Jean Harper, a Pomona school teacher on vacation, is taking a bus tour through Mexico. Bored, she misses the bus and soon finds herself looking at Jimmy Donovan...30 years old and six feet high, and she thinks he is better to look at than ruins 1000 years old and 900 feet high. He is a high-priced divorce lawyer, also on vacation, and bicycling his way to Acapulco to "stay out of trouble." Thus begins a tour of Mexico by bus, bicycle, ox-cart and by foot and, before they reach Acapulco, he is accused of kidnapping Jean and both become the object of a nation-wide search. They also get adopted, along the way, by a whimsical Mexican orphan boy.
