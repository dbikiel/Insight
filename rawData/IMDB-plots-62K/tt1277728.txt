Gianni is a middle-aged man living in Rome with his imposing and demanding elderly mother. His only outlet from her and the increasing debt into which they are sinking, are the increasingly frequent quiet sessions at the local tavern. As an Oriental saying goes, 'Moments of crisis are moments of opportunities'. These appear during the celebration of the holiday of Ferragosto on 15 August. That's when everybody leaves town to have fun. Opportunity knocks on Gianni's door in the most unexpected way.
In Rome, Gianni leads a lazy life, a glass of wine at hand; his only job is caring for his mother in their condo. The administrator pays Gianni a visit on a hot August day because he hasn't paid the condo fees in years; the association members want Gianni and his mother evicted. The visitor makes an offer: he wants to leave the city for ferragosto, a mid-August tradition, and asks to leave his mother in Gianni's care in exchange for writing off some of the debt. Gianni and his mother agree to do it, and the administrator brings his mom - and his aunt. Then, Gianni's doctor pays a call and asks the same favor. Can Gianni make the best of it, or are real surprises in store?
