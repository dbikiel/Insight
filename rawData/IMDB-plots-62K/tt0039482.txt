Frankie Madison leaves prison expecting a share from his ex-partner. But Prohibition bootlegging didn't prepare Frankie for Big Business.
Frankie Madison returns to New York after 14 years in prison. Noll Turner, Frankie's former partner in bootlegging, is now a wealthy nightclub manager, and Frankie is expecting him to honor a verbal '50:50' agreement they made when he was caught and Noll got away. Fat chance! Can Frankie, who knows only the strong-arm methods of Prohibition, win out against Big Business? It'll be tough...even with the unlikely alliance of torch singer Kay (Noll's ex-girlfriend).
After fourteen years in prison for bootlegging, Frankie Madison is released and returns To New York to meet his friend and partner Noll "Dink" Turner. Madison has an agreement with Dink, who is the manager of a successful nightclub, to share half of his business since he did not rat him when he was caught by the police. Dink uses his mistress Kay Lawrence to learn what Madison's real intention are and his friend Dave to explain that he has the right of less than US$ 3,000,00. Madison is not convinced and when Dink decides to get married to Mrs. Alexis Richardson - Kristine Miller, Kay teams up with Madison to retrieve his share.
