A cardsharp comes to the aid of a Mexican family.
Tim Madigan (Tim McCoy), gentleman gambler who never carries a gun, exposes a card sharp cheating Jose Hernandez (Red Lease.) Later, the gambler is shot after being knocked unconscious by Tim. Through circumstances, Jose thinks he did the killing, while Marshal Tom Barstow (Earle Hodgins) thinks Tim is the guilty party.Tim takes refuge at the ranch of Don Hernandez (Joseph Girard) and his daughter Juanita (Luana Walters), not knowing the youth he befriended is the runaway son of the family. Saloon owner Amos Harden (J. Frank Glendon) and gambler Ace Morgan (Wheeler Oakman), who sat in on the card game preceding the murder, are plotting to acquire the Hernandez ranch by means of a forged document. Harassed by the Marshal, who is seeking to unravel the murder mystery, Tim persuades Jose to return home. Tim then wins enough in a poker game with Harden and Morgan to save the Hernandez ranch. He stakes his winnings against Harden's saloon and wins with aces-and-eights, known throughout the West as the hand held by Wild Bill Hickok when he was killed by Jack McCall.
