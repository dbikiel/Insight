A 3-D concert film of the 2007 Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus tour.
As the movie starts, during the Walt Disney logo, we hear a voice. This turns out to be Miley warming up. After a few backstage moments, a huge box comes down, and out comes Miley (as Hannah) and she sings Rockstar. After that we go back in time a few weeks and see Miley during rehearsals.
