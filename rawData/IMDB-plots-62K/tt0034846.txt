A wealthy woman, trying to discourage a former boyfriend from pursuing her, hires a young songwriter who needs money to pay off his gambling debts to pretend to be her boyfriend. The problem is that the "phony" boyfriend is actually really in love with her.
Terry Trindale, one half of the songwriting team of Trindale and Champagne, has been in love with socialite Consuelo Croydon ever since he first laid eyes on her in a casino three weeks ago, he doing whatever needed to be near her every time he goes to the casino, but never talking to her. When he finally does approach her, he discovers that she has noticed him too, but has no time for him, regardless of who he is. Because of his infatuation with her, he loses track of what he is doing and becomes indebted to her in the amount of $3,200, money which he doesn't have. But when an ex-fiancé named Tony Barling reenters her life, she believes she has a way for Terry to pay off his debt to her. As Tony is a man she knows is not good for her but who she can't resist, she hires Terry for a ten week period to be her confidential secretary, whose sole responsibilities are to masquerade as her fiancé in front of Tony, and to protect her from Tony, such as ensuring she makes no attempt to go anywhere near him otherwise. The contract, which Terry does sign, also stipulates that he will not try to take advantage of her romantically while in this employ. As Terry and Chappie aka "Champagne" largely place their struggling songwriting career on hold, Terry and Consuelo embark on a battle a wills, Consuelo doing whatever she can to ditch Terry to be with Tony, and Terry doing whatever to stop her. In the process, they may both come to a realization of their true feeling for the other.
