A boy finds his way into the Little Red Riding Hood cartoon in order to save the girl from the Big Bad Wolf.
A couple of minutes before the beginning of the film show, schoolboy Petya Ivanov runs to the cartoon "Little Red Riding Hood" - and does not have time. There are no tickets left for sale, but is this an obstacle for a restless little boy? Having got inside the cinema through a hole in the fence, he finds himself not just in the hall, but on the big screen, where the trusting and sociable girl is about to get into trouble because of the Gray Wolf. Contrary to the admonitions of the omniscient announcer, Peter refuses to stand by. He decides to help good heroes, teach the villain a lesson and bring the story to a happy end.
