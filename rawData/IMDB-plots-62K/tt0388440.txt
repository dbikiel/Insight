Steve Martin's first network special for NBC. The show is half concert footage (shot at the Universal Amphitheatre in LA) and half sketches. Sketches include: Martin as "Turtle Boy," rodeo-riding a giant turtle; Martin hosting a variety show, on which Johnny Cash discusses his research in astronomy; and Martin five years later as a drunken bum.
