Handsome entrepeneur Abelardo Rios Clarios arrives in the sleepy little town of Villaserena, rigs up speakers throughout the village, and begins broadcasting "Radio Nobleza". For a small sum of money, they can now buy the opportunity to express publicly what they couldn't say before. Villaserena's closets are quickly emptied of their skeletons, old quarrels are revived and secrets are no longer. Abelardo soon discovers the beautiful Celeste, a beautiful young woman virtually imprisoned behind the walls of her father's house, and romance ensues.
