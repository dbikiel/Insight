A college Principal objects to a nightclub opening near his campus.
Ozzie Norton and his band, featuring Betty Blake of Brooklyn, prepare for the opening of the College Club, a nightclub near the campus of Lambeth Technological . On opening night, Minnie Lambeth Sparr, daughter of the college founder, descends with Professor Bailey, the sheriff and Harriet Hale, daughter of Dr. Hale, president of the school. The band and all persons connected are arrested under an old statute. Harriet, against the move, arranges for their release. Betty, Ozzie and the band picket the college in jive fashion.
