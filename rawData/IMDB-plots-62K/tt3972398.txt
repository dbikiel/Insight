A live telecast of the beloved J. M. Barrie story.
Spoilers: Story of three English children joining that forever-youthful Peter Pan, in a journey to Neverland. They encounter adventures with pirates and other exciting beings. The swashbucklers actually sing and dance.The English children need a vacation from their parents, er, actually their father who is very stuffy and economy-minded. Their mother is lovely, kind and sweet, but perhaps the children need the time away in order to appreciate how good she really is. There are animal characters, starting early on with a large fluffy dog who guards the children's nursery. Her dog house sits inside the nursery itself. There is also an exotic blue alligator later on in the story, who has the sound effects of an alarm clock. One animal is real. The other is played by a human actor. Annie
