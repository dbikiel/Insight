In a small village lost in the middle of a boundless forest a teenager is in love with an older woman. He does not know how to strike up a conversation with her, much less how to tell her about his feelings. The boy's father is pursuing the same woman and is ready to leave his family for her. The personal conflict between father and son is swept up in the turmoil of outside events which turn neighbor against neighbor, dividing them into 'us' and 'them'. Every day those who are stronger show more and more disregard and contempt for the values of the weak, pushing everyone's life towards a disaster.
