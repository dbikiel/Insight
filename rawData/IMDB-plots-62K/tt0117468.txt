A psychiatrist makes multiple trips through time to save a woman that was murdered by her brutal husband.
Karen has to take a ride in Frank's car. He's travelling with his wife, on his way to sell computer chips, which he obtained illegally. He suspects his wife is being unfaithful and tragic things happen, following a discussion. Karen escapes, reaching a lab where a scientist has discovered how to go back in time, and she returns by accident some minutes before the violent events. Then she tries to make things better, but things tend to become worse, as time cycles keep being repeated.
A woman, whose car breaks down on the highway, is picked up by a crazed stranger and his obviously threatened girl friend. Despite potential escape opportunities, she stays with the couple who is involved in some kind of unexplained thievery involving a computer disk. After a series of murders, including the girl friend, the woman manages to escape to a scientific lab where time travel is being experimented with. Here she asks to go back in time to try to stop the killings. Repeated attempts results in the same deaths.
