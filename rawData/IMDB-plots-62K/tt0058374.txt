A fairy-tale about a conceited young man and a young woman with a tyrannical step-mother, who must overcome magical trials in order to be together.
Once upon a time there was a kind and quiet old man with a grumpy and domineering old woman. The old man had his own daughter - a modest, beautiful and hard-working Nastya, and the old woman had her own - envious, couch potato, and the plain woman Marfushka. Once in the forest, Nastya meets her fate, a young man Ivan, whose beauty and power conquered a lot of girlish hearts. But pride and rudeness played a cruel joke with him - in front of the frightened Nastenka, the forest sorcerer turns Ivan's beautiful face into a bearish face. So he stayed on until he learns to do good deeds.
