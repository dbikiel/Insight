Bugs Bunny reflects on his past cartoon exploits.
The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie is basically a collection of Warner Bros. short cartoon features, "starring" the likes of Daffy Duck, Porky Pig and Wile.E.Coyote. These animations are interspersed by Bugs Bunny reminiscing on past events and providing links between the individual animations which are otherwise unconnected. The Road Runner feature at the end consists of sketches from various RR separates (well it does in the 78-minute version anyway).
