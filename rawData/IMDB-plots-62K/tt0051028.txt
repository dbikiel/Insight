A group of disillusioned American expatriate writers live a dissolute, hedonistic lifestyle in 1920s France and Spain.
Paris in the 1920s. The American journalist Jake and his friends spend the time at cafés. He has a special interest in his ex-fiancée Lady Ashley. They take a vacation in Pamplona to watch the bull-fights.
Europe, 1922. The post-war 'lost generation' of expatriates who 'continued to live as if they were about to die' includes newspaperman Jake Harris, impotent due to a war wound; gorgeous party girl Lady Brett Ashley, hopelessly in love with Jake whom she can't marry because of her sexual needs; Brett's purely nominal fiance, Mike; and writers Robert and Bill. They wander about Europe in berets, drinking, having affairs, and finding no lasting satisfaction in anything.
