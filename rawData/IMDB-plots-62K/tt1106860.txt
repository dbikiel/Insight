A man meets up with two "good guys" to recover what is unlawfully his, taking them on his whirlwind ride, doing things they never would have imagined, just to survive.
A stroke of good luck turns lethal for Sam Phelan and his wife Leslie when they are faced with a life-changing decision that brings strange and sinister Pyke Kubic to their doorstep. As Pyke leads Sam and Leslie on a tumultuous adventure through the streets of Chicago, each are pulled deeper and deeper into a desperate spiral of deception and violence... All in the name of money.
In Chicago, Sam Phelan and his wife Leslie are facing financial problems to pay their mortgage after a period of unemployment. While driving his old Buick below an overpass, a case falls onto the hood of the car and he finds that there are more than six hundred thousand dollars inside. Sam and Leslie quit their job; pay their mortgage; buy a Land Rover; and refurnish their house. Meanwhile a British criminal (Pyke Kubic) arrives from London to visit his brother Reeve in jail. He tells his brother that he threw the stolen money away to destroy the evidences of the heist, and saw a Caucasian in an old car retrieving the case. Pyke chases and finds Sam and partially retrieves the money, but more than seventy-four thousand dollars have been spent by the greedy couple and Pyke wants them to refund the amount in five days.
A husband receives manna from heaven in the form of a suitcase with $625,000 falling on his white Buick. Instead of solving his problems via paying off his to-be foreclosed on house and granting his wishes, things escalate into a What-Will you do morality play for CASH. The cash is from a heist that one brother of a set of identical twins pulls of. The second brother is a sort or mercenary for hire, who is perfect with numbers down to the last penny. So much so that he forces people do do anything for even just 12 cents.
