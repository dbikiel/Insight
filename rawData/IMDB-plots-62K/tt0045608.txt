In the nineteenth century, in Sierra Morena and in the Serran√≠a de Ronda, a lot of bandoleros proliferated, who, alone or gathered in parties, sowed panic by assaulting and murdering travelers. Many of them were sung in poems that gave origin to the myth of the generous bandit. In fact, most of them were ruthless and unfeeling men. Nevertheless, one of them, Lucero, was considered in the whole mountain range like the paladin of the disinherited ones of fortune.
