After 1945, six German ex-soldiers are hired to defuse unexploded Allied bombs in the ruins of Berlin.
At the end of the Second World War six German ex-soldiers return to Berlin and set up as a bomb disposal group. The pressure of the dangerous work starts to affect them, the more so as they have agreed to pool half their pay so that if only one survives he takes it all. Casualties and friction are inevitable, and having to handle British 1000lb bombs seems particularly bad news.
Shotly after Germany's defeat in World War II, Karl Wirtz (Jeff Chandler) and Eric Koertner (Jack Palance), and three cronies return to a bombed-out Berlin from a prisoner-of-war camp. Being demolition experts, they accept the dangerous but high paying job of defusing many of the still-unexploded Allied bombs throughout the city. At the suggestion of Wirtz, each man is to pay half of his earnings into a joint fund- If a man dies in the course of the job, his share is to be divided among the others---until the last men or man (if any)alive at the end of six months collects the residue of this macabre "estate." Nearing the end of their job, only Wirtz and Koertner are still alive...and both are in love with Margot Hoefer (Martine Carol). This situation does not bode well for somebody.
