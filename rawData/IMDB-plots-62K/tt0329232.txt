"Thereâ&amp;#x20AC;TMs a balance in the world. Itâ&amp;#x20AC;TMs like a boomerang! If I do good around me, nothing bad will ever happen to me. When I do good around me, it always comes back to meâ&amp;#x20AC;¦" Norah Abandoned in the early months of her life by her mother, Norah, aged 17, lives alone with her father. Norah blames herself for all the worldâ&amp;#x20AC;TMs misfortunes and, particularly, about the death of a rallye pilot, Nico Marcuse, whom she saw the accident on TV. Animated by a deep feeling of guilt, Norah nourishes, since then, a priviliged relationship with Nico Marcuse and implies herself in humanitarian aid. Norahâ&amp;#x20AC;TMs perfectly organized life is turned upside-down the day she meets her maternal grand-mother of whom she ignored the existence. Straight arrived from Portugal, she gives her granddaughter a little inheritance andâ&amp;#x20AC;¦ her motherâ&amp;#x20AC;TMs address in Switzerland! From mistakes to clumsiness, from confrontations to disappointments, Norahâ&amp;#x20AC;TMs life becomes a real nightmare! She then understands she has no choice left: she must face her past. In the Swiss mountains, once for all, Norah settles the scores with her mother, with Nico Marcuse and with herself.
