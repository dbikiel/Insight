The film Sunday League is set just before the beginning of the TV series Okresni prebor (2010)). The film's story takes us back in time to Houslice and everything is once again centered around the local Slavoj football club, its players, functionaries and, primarily, its coach Pepik Hn치tek. Pepik Hn치tek (Miroslav Krobot) is a big man in Houslice. The authoritative coach is an indispensable strategist of the district football scene and the soul of the entire club. Football means everything to him which is something his wife finds hard to accept, but it is his heart that is affected the most and after years of stress and nervous exertion it is slowly beginning to give up. So far the obstinate Hn치tek has been successfully hiding this fact from everyone, but when his heart is hit by its seventeenth heart attack the experienced coach will have to decide whether to choose life or football. Hn치tek, quite logically, chooses football.
