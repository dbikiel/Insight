The unconventional love story of an aspiring actress, her ambitious driver, and their eccentric boss, the legendary billionaire Howard Hughes.
It's Hollywood, 1958. Aspiring actress, songwriter, small town beauty queen and devout Baptist virgin Marla Mabrey (Lily Collins) has a contract with movie mogul Howard Hughes (Warren Beatty) and arrives with her mother (Annette Bening) in Los Angeles to do a screen test for one of his film projects. At the airport, they meet their driver Frank Forbes (Alden Ehrenreich). Forbes is an ambitious young man with a business plan and engaged to his 7th grade sweetheart, both deeply religious Methodists. The instant attraction that Marla and Frank feel for each other not only puts their religious convictions and moral values to the test, but also defies Hughes' #1 rule: No employee is allowed to have any relationship whatsoever with a contract actress. Hughes' enigmatic behavior intersects with Marla and Frank in separate and unexpected ways, and as they are drawn deeper into his bizarre world, their values are challenged and their lives are changed.
In 1964 Acapulco, Frank Forbes, Levar Mathis, and Nadine Henly are anxiously pushing their employer, Howard Hughes, to phone in to a press conference. In 1958 Los Angeles, Frank picks up Marla Mabrey, a devout Baptist beauty queen, alongside her strict mother Lucy. Marla is under contract with Hughes' RKO Pictures, receiving $400 a week ($3,390 today) and living in a beautiful home. Frank becomes Marla's main driver, chauffeuring her to the singing and dancing classes set up for Hughes' current retinue of 26 contract starlets..
