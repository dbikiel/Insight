When a veteran marshal is sent to a small town, he quickly falls for two women: a midwife and an earthy young woman nicknamed "Frisky".
Marshal Antonio Carotenuto is sent to Sagliena, an imaginary little village in the center of Italy in the '50s, to assume his new mandate. In the village he knows Maria (Frisky) AKA 'la Bersagliera', secretly in love with a policeman (Carabiniere) reporting to Antonio. But also Paoletta, the priest's nephew, loves him. Things become more complicated when Annarella, the midwife, starts demonstrating her love to Antonio. She is hiding a secret and the Marshal soon will be in a restless situation.
