Enoch Arden, a humble fisherman, marries Annie Lee. He signs on as a sailor to make more money to support their growing family. A storm wrecks his ship, but Enoch swims to a deserted island. Annie waits vainly for his return.
There is a small need to describe this subject as the poem of Lord Tennyson is so well known, so suffice it to say that this Biograph subject is an unusually faithful portrayal of that beautiful romance of Enoch Arden, Annie Lee and Philip Ray, taken in scenes of rare beauty. This first part tells of the betrothal of Enoch and Annie, the despair of Enoch at his inability to cope with the demands of his increasing family obligations, and his sailing away to recoup his fortunes on a vessel bound for China. A storm is encountered, the vessel is wrecked and Enoch and two companions are washed upon a tropical island, where they are forced to stay. Annie, all the while is ever hopeful of his return, while Philip, though an unsuccessful rival, shows a kindly interest in the little grief-stricken family.
