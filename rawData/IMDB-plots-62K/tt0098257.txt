DEA agents flying cargo as part of their cover make an emergency landing on a remote island in the pacific, where several unscrupulous parties are looking for a WWII gold treasure.
Donna and Taryn are federal drug enforcement agents based in the Hawaiian isles. Upon the success of a drug bust, they receive a call from Shane Aviation to fly an emergency package of vaccine from Molokai to Knox Island. Unbeknownst to them, Philippine representative Martinez has convinced Captain Andreas to use a reconnaissance satellite to locate a sunken ship laden with gold that the Japanese had pilfered during World War II. Meanwhile, a storm forces Donna and Taryn to land their plane on a remote island which harbors the gold. The hijinks ensue when they are joined by a host of nefarious types who have learned of the gold's location.
In an orchestrated raid, drug enforcement agents Donna and Taryn, with the help of undercover operatives Rocky and Pattycakes, manage to take down a profitable narcotics-smuggling ring in Hawaii. After the successful bust, the girls are assigned to deliver an emergency parcel of medical supplies and vaccines from their base in Molokai to the small and remote Knox Island, somewhere in the South Pacific region. In the meantime, Philippine government's representative Martinez who is concerned with the return of their national treasure stolen by the Japanese during WWII is working with the U.S. Navy using satellite reconnaissance information to detect the sunken gold. But when a raging storm forces Donna and Taryn to do an emergency landing on an idyllic island rumoured to have the treasure, a frantic race against Communist insurgents, double-crossing opportunists, samurais, as well as a horde of gun-toting assassins will commence.
