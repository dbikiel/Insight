Director/choreographer Bob Fosse tells his own life story as he details the sordid life of Joe Gideon, a womanizing, drug-using dancer.
In this Fosse variation of Fellini's 81/2, Broadway director, Joe Gideon is in the process of casting the chorus and staging the dance numbers for his latest show, starring his ex-wife, in what is largely a vanity project for her. Joe'sstory (which is really Fosse's own) tells his own life story as a philandering womanising artist.
Choreographing and picking dancers for his current show whilst editing his feature film about a stand-up comedian is getting to Joe Gideon. Without the chemical substances, he would not have the energy to keep up with his girlfriend, his ex-wife, and his special dancing daughter. They attempt to bring him back from the brink, but it's too late for his exhausted body and stress-ravaged heart. He chain-smokes, uses drugs, sleeps with his dancers and overworks himself into open-heart surgery. Scenes from his past life start to encroach on the present and he becomes increasingly aware of his mortality.
Joe Gideon is a theater director and choreographer trying to balance staging his latest Broadway musical with editing a Hollywood motion picture he has directed. He is a workaholic who chain-smokes cigarettes, and without a daily dose of Vivaldi, Visine, Alka-Seltzer, Dexedrine, and sex, he wouldn't have the energy to keep up the biggest show of all - his life. His girlfriend Katie Jagger, his ex-wife Audrey Paris, and daughter Michelle try to pull him back from the brink, but it is too late for his exhausted body and stress-ravaged heart. In his imagination, he flirts with an angel of death named Angelique.Meanwhile, Gideon's condition gets progressively worse. He is rushed to a hospital after experiencing chest pains during a particularly stressful table-read (with the production's penny-pinching backers in attendance) and admitted with severe angina. Joe brushes off his symptoms, and attempts to leave to go back to rehearsal, He collapses in the doctor's office and is ordered to stay in the hospital for several weeks to rest his heart and recover from his exhaustion. The show is postponed, but Gideon continues his antics from the hospital bed, in brazen denial of his mortality. Champagne flows, endless strings of women frolic around his hospital room and the cigarettes are always smoked. Cardiogram readings do not show any improvement as Gideon dances with death. As a negative review for his feature film (which has been released without him) comes in, Gideon has a massive coronary and undergoes coronary artery bypass surgery.Meanwhile, the show's backers must decide whether it's time to pack up, or replace Gideon as the director. Their matter-of-fact, money-oriented negotiations with the insurers are juxtaposed with graphic scenes of Joe's open heart surgery. The producers realize that the best way to recoup their money and make a profit is to bet on Gideon dying: the insurance proceeds which would bring in a profit of over $500,000. Meanwhile, elements from Gideon's past life are staged in dazzling dream sequences of musical numbers he directs from his hospital bed while on life support. Realizing his death is imminent, and his mortality unconquerable, Gideon has another heart attack. In the film's glittery finale, he goes through the five stages of death - anger, denial, bargaining, depression and acceptance - featured in the stand-up routine he has been editing. As death closes in on Gideon, the fantasy episodes become more hallucinatory and extravagant. In the film's epilogue arranged as a monumental variety show featuring everyone from his past, Gideon himself takes center stage.The final scene shows his corpse being zipped in a body bag.
