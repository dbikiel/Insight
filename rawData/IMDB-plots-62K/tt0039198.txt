An expedition into the deep jungle discovers a native tribe led by a tall white blonde woman.
Diamond mine owner Mark Harper (Douglass Dumbrille) hires pilot Steve Blake (Leif Erickson) and his pal Hoppy Owens (Frank Jenks)to search for a hidden jungle village from which the natives have made trouble for his mine operations. They crash near the village and discover that Meelah (Gale Sherwood), a white girl brought up by the natives after her parents had been killed for their property by Harper, is the head of the village. Returning to the mine, Harper, already suspicious of what they may have learned and jealous of the attention his wife, Connie Harper (Veda Ann Borg), is paying to Steve, has them jailed, while he leads an expedition against the village and Meelah.
Pilot Steve Blake and his co-pilot Hoppy Owens are hired by mine owner Mark Harper help him locate the natives who have been attacking his diamond mining operation. Blake has a bit of a history with Harper's wife Connie but he's no longer interested now that she married. He and Hoppy fly over the jungle to try and locate the natives' village only to crash when their engine fails. They survive the crash and locate the village but to their amazement, they find that that the natives leader is a white woman, Meelah, whom they raised after the death of her parents. They also learn that Harper has been less than honest with them about his dealings with the natives from he's stolen the land his diamond mine sits on.
