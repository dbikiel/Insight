The dark, surreal story of a cat who wants to be human.
Legend has it, that deep in a foul stone-walled well resides a vile feline being, which instead of paws, has human hands for stealing body parts from unsuspecting passersby. With this in mind, a weary old man leads an enigmatic young stranger deep in the rude and undisturbed woods to witness firsthand the otherworldly creature. Could this ghastly old folk tale be true after all?
