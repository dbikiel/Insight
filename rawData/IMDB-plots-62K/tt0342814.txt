The decent model Gay Andrews and the sleazy married advertising executive Bob Walker leave a New Jersey restaurant. In Walker's car they immediately get into an argument because she won't go to a motel with him. The disappointed Walker is taking her home when he's pulled over for speeding by a cop, and taken to a police office where Walker has to pay a fine of $100. But Bob has to drive to New York to get the money, so Miss Andrews remains at the police office. While Bob's gone, the pudgy Wayne Jackson, also picked up for speeding, feels sorry for her. He then takes Miss Andrews to a restaurant where he drugs her.
