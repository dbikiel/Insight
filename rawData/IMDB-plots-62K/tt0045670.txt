A young woman enters a contest to be the first to swim the English Channel.
The health conscious, dairy-farming Higgins family begin each day with an invigorating swim. One day, traveling health-tonic salesman, Windy Weebe, comes to town and suggests they could swim the English Channel. Sponsored by "Liquapep" and coached by Windy, the family arrive in Europe. There it is decided that daughter Katie is the only one strong enough to enter the contest. But while she should be focused on the difficult and risky task ahead, Katie is pursed by dashing Frenchman, Andr√© Lanet... This comedic musical is well remembered for the scene when Katie dreams she is swimming with cartoon characters Tom &amp; Jerry!
