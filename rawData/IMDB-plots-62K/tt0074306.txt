Five sexy high school graduates try to lose their virginity in a creative manner.
Six girls from a High School who are on a trip at the end of the classes begin a competition between them who will be first to lose virginity. But it seems more difficult for them as it might appear.
Five recent graduates of an all-girl high school - Kippy, Sarah, Michelle, Peaches and Alison - attempt to lose their virginity during a two-week bicycle trip with their seemingly repressed teacher Miss Woodruff. The girls hold a contest to see who can lose their virginity in the most creative and original manner.
