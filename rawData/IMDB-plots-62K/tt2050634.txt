Backwater is doomed by the regular visits of the undertaker and its dwellers blame a tramp.
Backwater is doomed by the regular visits of the undertaker. The town priest and the faithful think that a merry non-religious tramp brings the death that follows living in an improvised shed in the middle of the town. It looks like when he sings the undertaker visits. But is he the one to blame for their misfortune?
In the small town of Backwater, its God-fearing townspeople live constantly under the shadow of the obscure and always silent Undertaker, knowing that each time he comes to town, death comes along. With the exception of the town's only atheist, a carefree vagabond, everyone else fears that he might be next, however, this time, the Undertaker's ghastly promise fails and not a single person dies. Inevitably, as the tension boils over, eventually, the wraith-like gravedigger won't leave empty-handed.
