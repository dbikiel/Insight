In 1864, due to frequent Apache raids from Mexico into the U.S., a Union officer decides to illegally cross the border and destroy the Apache, using a mixed army of Union troops, Confederate POWs, civilian mercenaries, and scouts.
During the last winter of the Civil War, cavalry officer Amos Dundee leads a contentious troop of Army regulars, Confederate prisoners and scouts on an expedition into Mexico to destroy a band of Apaches who have been raiding U.S. bases in Texas.
In 1864, the Apache warriors led by Sierra Charriba slaughter a Union troop of soldiers and a family of settlers. They abduct their three sons and flee to Mexico. Major Amos Charles Dundee, who was disgraced at the Battle of Gettysburg and sent to a POW outpost in New Mexico, decides to hunt down Sierra Charriba and his Apache seeking for glory. He recruits an army of Confederate prisoners-of-war, black soldiers, a reverend that knows the boys and outcast people (thieves, drunken etc.) and chases the Apache group seeking also revenge, crossing illegally the border with Mexico.
In 1864 Major Amos Dundee leads his troops into Mexico after a group of renegade Apache Indians, led by Sierra Chariba. On a recent raid, they kidnapped some young boys and Dundee is committed to retrieving them. His own Union troops are supplemented by Confederate prisoners of war. Led by Lt. Benjamin Tyree - he and Dundee were once friends - he gives his word that he will follow Dundee's orders until Chariba is caught. Over the course of several months, Dundee and his men not only have to fight the Apaches but also French troops. As the mission continues, tensions rise between the Union and Confederate troops leading to a final confrontation with their foe.
