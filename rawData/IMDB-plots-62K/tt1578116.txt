Chastised by their son, Aayush's Hindi school-teacher for not conversing in the national language, as well as ignoring the relevance of the word 'Atithi', Mumbai-based Bollywood writer, Puneet, and his Architect's Assistant wife, Moon Moon, go out of their way to welcome an hitherto unknown paternal uncle, Lambodar, from Gorakhpur. Hoping that he will depart soon, the couple find their lives turned upside when he not only refuses to leave but interferes with their professional and personal lives - so much so that Puneet gets fired from his movie project 'Pachaas', and Moon Moon almost loses her job.
