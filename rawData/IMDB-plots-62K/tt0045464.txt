A young boy travels to an imaginary world where, assisted by his family's plumber, he must save other piano playing kids like himself from the dungeons of his dictatorial piano teacher who also mind-controls his mother.
The bane of young Bart Collins' existence are the piano lessons he's forced to take under the tutelage of Dr. Terwilliker, the only person he detests because of his dictatorial nature. Bart feels Dr. Terwilliker has undue influence on his widowed mother, Heloise. Bart constantly daydreams of a place - the Terwilliker Institute- overlorded by the evil madman; Dr Terwilliker. The mad doctor's built a piano so immense, it needs 500 children to play it.
The only film Theodore Geisel - better known as Dr. Seuss! was involved in brining to fruition. Bart has only one enemy in the world: his piano teacher, Dr. Terwilliker. Dr. T has a mad plan to force 500 youngsters to practice at his magnificent piano - 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Bart's the only hope to save these kids from being enslaved. Fantastic sets, screenplay, and even song lyrics were provided by Dr. Seuss. This candy-coloured, live-action film is in many ways, just as fun, as his well-known books and TV specials.
