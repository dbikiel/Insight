An unconventional dentist deals with a variety of eccentric and difficult patients in slapstick fashion.
After preliminaries with ice and golf, dentist Fields turns to the problems of his patients. He wrestles one woman all over the office during an extraction. One man is so heavily bearded he can't find the man's mouth and uses a shotgun to flush out birds.
After a round of golf in which he angers both his partner and others on the course, a dyspeptic dentist returns to deal with patients and family problems. His daughter desires to marry the ice deliveryman. He disapproves of this match and locks her up in a room above his dental office. Various patients with unusual physical traits and eccentric personalities arrive at the office. He attempts to deal with them while his daughter noisily expresses her displeasure upstairs. In the end everything pulls out OK.
