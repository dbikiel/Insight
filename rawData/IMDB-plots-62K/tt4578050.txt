The devil tricks a little boy off his laughter in exchange for assured wins in all his bets. It depicts his journey after the deal with the devil, how he loses his soul bit by bit with each win.
The young Timm Thaler lives in the 1920s with his father in a small alley of a German city. Even when he grows up in poor circumstances, he is happy, and he has a laugh that nobody can resist. This is so contagious and disarming that Baron Lefuet, the fierce Baron, wants to have it.
