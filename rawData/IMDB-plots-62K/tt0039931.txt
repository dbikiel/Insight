Intrepid frontiersman Chris Holden foils the political and personal ambitions of renegade Martin Garth in the Ohio Valley following the French and Indian War.
In 1763, felon Abby Hale is sentenced to slavery in America. In Virginia, heroic Capt. Holden buys her, intending to free her, but villain Garth foils this plan, and Abby toils at Dave Bone's tavern. Garth is fomenting an Indian uprising to clear the wilderness of settlers, giving him a monopoly of the fur trade. Holden discovers Garth's treachery, but cannot prove anything against him. Can Holden and Abby save Fort Pitt from the Senecas? Many hairbreadth escapes.
It's 1763 and two men taking the same ship back to Virginia from London bid for the contract of a woman who was given a choice between execution in England or 14 years of indentured servitude in the colonies. The winner gallantly tells her she is free and leaves the ship to join his fiance. The loser destroys the contract and takes the woman off to the frontier. His shipboard rival follows him west to foil his plans of controlling the Ohio Valley and to deliver peace belts to the Indians who have already sent out war belts.
