Cheol-hui and Tae-hun join forces to rescue their missing friend and prevent a catastrophic war.
Asian Maverick is a hot pilot. When he encounters a pair of MiGs over the Asian Persian Gulf, his wingman is clearly outflown and freaks. On almost no fuel, Asian Maverick is able to talk him back down to the Carrier. When his wingman turns in his wings, Asia Maverick is moved up in the standings and sent to the Top Gun Naval Flying School. There he fights the attitudes of the other pilots and an old story of his father's death in combat that killed others due to his father's error. Asian Maverick struggles to be the best pilot, stepping on the toes of his other students and in a different way to Asian Charlie, a civilian instructor to whom he is strongly attracted.
