Unemployed for three years, Gerard has landed a job in Indonesia. To start off on the right foot with his "team leader", Gerard invites him to dinner. Considering his wife's lack of culinary talent, that may not be the brightest idea he ever had. Their neighbor, Alexandre, a PR whiz, is willing to help, as long as Gerard and Colette are prepared to accept changes in their habits and surroundings. After many dramas, mishaps, misunderstandings and general bungling, with frazzled nerves, Gerard and Colette open the door to welcome... their dinner guest.
