A CEO looking for the truth. An investigation too much dangerous to be concluded.
A large multinational company is shaken by the suicide of three employees. The company sends a director, Sofia Cuevas, to conduct an internal investigation. She discovers an unhealthy work environment: a pathogenic form of management where the individual is relegated to a minor role and the only priority is the bottom line. But, what are the real reasons that lead a man to suicide?
Sofía Cuevas is a CEO from a high-tech company who is sent to her former business branch after three employees committed suicide in a period of five months. Reluctant to fulfill the job, Sofía travels to the building, meeting the head director Carlos Fresno and some of the employees, such as Gabriela Benassar, and discovering one of the employees is her friend and ex lover Alejandro García. Sofía interviews the staff of the company, she starts to doubt the reasons given for the three suicides. She is warned about the abusive methods used to motivate staff and impossible projects with unrealistic deadlines. Is it possible that the three deaths could be unrelated, the result of unstable minds or perhaps these three suicides could be related to a conspiracy within the company?
