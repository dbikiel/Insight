Col. Jason Halsey (USAF) has just had a terrible air disaster and can't remember a thing -- even his name. Now he must go head-to-head with the psychiatrist Dr. Gottlieb as his only chance to recover his memory. Col. Halsey is a stealth fighter test pilot in the highly classified project Black Magic. Is Dr. Gottlieb a helping professional or is he a counter-intelligence agent sent to debrief Halsey? This movie draws considerable footage from the Lockheed Corp. documentary "Blackbird: The Movie" for its background material on the SR-71 spy plane.
