What is man ? Man makes war, man kills man, man hunts, man is executed. A montage mixing original drawings by Topor, original shots and stock shots that ironically analyze what man is.
In this small blue planet called Earth, its weird inhabitants live and die for one principal reason: to kill. As a result, behind humanity's repugnant hypocrisy, death, destruction, wickedness, fatal societal contradictions and moral absurdity are hidden in plain sight; man seems to be inextricably linked with violence, trapped in a vicious cycle of blood and war. And in between, the amorphous boundless void of dead time.
