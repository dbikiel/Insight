The everyday lives of teenagers, coming from various social backgrounds. For them, sexuality has become a substitute for love, resulting from emotional neglect.
Sarah is 13. She and her best friend Charly (16) have already lost count of the men they have been to bed with: one night stands, nameless, and interchangeable - no commitments. Then Sarah meets 18-year-old Lukas in a chat room, and for the first time in her life she longs for a real relationship, for true love even. But is Lukas really interested in her? Or is he just using Sarah for a reason that lies far beyond love and affection? Meanwhile, Charly has to find a father for her unborn child, and Sarah's mother has to cope with the fact that she's not a teenager anymore... Three days in the lives of a group of teenagers struggling to grow up and to find their places in life.
