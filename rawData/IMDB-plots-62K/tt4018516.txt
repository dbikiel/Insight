A coming-of-age story about a tough and troubled little girl who runs away from her self-obsessed father and, in the vast and colorful New England woods, develops a close friendship with an older man who is easily terrified, but who is also the first truly loving person she has ever met. As they hunt through the woods for his late wife's necklace, they soon realize that they themselves are being hunted by a dangerous stranger.
