This film-noir piece, told in semi-documentary style, follows police on the hunt for a resourceful criminal who shoots and kills a cop.
In post WW II, Los Angeles, a cop's killed in the middle of the night. With no leads, the chief of police assigns Sgts. Jones and Brennan to investigate and apprehend the killer. They target low-level criminals, such as Paul Reeves, hoping he'll lead them to bigger fish, specially, the one who shot and killed the cop.
When a police officer is gunned down by a man whom he had stopped to question, a city-wide dragnet fails to catch the shooter, leaving the police with only minor clues to go on. The police must piece together a description of the man from a few small clues, as they search for a dangerous, resourceful criminal.
