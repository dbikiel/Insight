After opening a convent in the Himalayas, five nuns encounter conflict and tension - both with the natives and also within their own group - as they attempt to adapt to their remote, exotic surroundings.
Five nuns open a convent in the Himalayas, where they encounter conflict and tension - not just with the nearby inhabitants, but also amongst themselves, as they attempt to surmount the difficulties inherent in trying to adjust to their new environment.
A group of nuns is sent to open a convent high in the Himalayas. The locals are friendly and welcome them enthusiastically, as does the local ruler, The General. His English adviser is another matter altogether, for many reasons. When the General dies and his 20-something year old son takes over, things get even more complicated.
Sister Clodah is dispatched with four other nuns to establish a new convent far in the Himalayas. It's a difficult journey and their new house is a ramshackle old building on the edge of a cliff that had been abandoned by a religious Brotherhood many years before. They soon establish a school and an infirmary though the local General's agent, Mr. Dean, warns them against treating the deathly ill as they would no doubt be blamed if the patient doesn't recover. The location, the culture and the mountain air all begin to have a strange effect on the Sisters. Sister Clodagh, who is also on her first assignment as Sister Superior, begins to remember a romance she had as a young woman before entering the sisterhood. Another however, becomes obsessed with Mr. Dean, which leads to tragedy.
Anglican nuns, led by the stern Sister Clodagh, attempt to establish a religious community in the Himalayas, and must battle not only suspicious locals and the elements, but their own demons as well.
