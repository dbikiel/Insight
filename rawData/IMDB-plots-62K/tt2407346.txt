An adaptation of the old Chinese tale "The Ten Brothers".
Three twin brothers, Liu, lived in China long time ago. They were so similar that even their own mother could distinguish them only by the color ribbons tied to their wrists. Each of them had a unique skill: one of them commanded fire, the other - water (that is, he could drink the whole sea, and then return all the water back), and the third understands the language of nature, birds, animals and fish. In addition to such unusual skills, the brothers had a good temper - they willingly helped people cope with their troubles, protected animals and nature.
