A reporter hunts down a 144-year old alchemist who is killing women for their blood.
Reporter Carl Kolchak is now in Seattle, Washington, trying to solve the mystery of several strangulations that recur every few years where the victims are drained of blood in this second made for TV pilot.
After being run out of Las Vegas, Kolchak heads for Seattle and another reporting job with the local paper. It's not long before he is on the trail of another string of bizarre murders. It seems that every 21 years, for the past century, a killer kills a certain number of people, drains them of their blood and then disappears into the night, that is until the next 21 years passes. Kolchak is on his trail, but the question is, can he stop him before he disappears again?
Reporter Carl Kolchak is back and this time he is on the trail of a serial killer who is targeting dancers in the Seattle area. The strange thing about the killings is the fact that all the victims had some of their spinal fluid drained and that there was rotting flesh found around the victims necks. Soon Kolchak learns that similar killings have been occurring in the Seattle area every twenty-one years for over 100 years. The trail soon leads to Seattle's underground city and he winds up meeting the killer who tells him that he uses the spinal fluid for a elixir which has been keeping him alive. Unfortunately, it only lasts for twenty-one years and after that time period is up he must leave his abode and go looking for fresh victims. It is now up to Kolchak to stop this madman before he takes the elixir.
