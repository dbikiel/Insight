A drama about a Cambridge poetry professor who begins to re-evaluate his life of Byronic excess.
Richard followed in his father's footsteps as Cambridge literature professor. Having fallen in love with LA socialite student Kate, he decides to move for her to California, enjoying a grand villa her father gave them but settling for a tacky position in a second-rate college. The relationship goes wrong, like his next with her bossy sister Olivia, but this time he's devoted to their darling son and caught up I a hedonistic lifestyle of mild (?) debauchery. Things are further complicated by new partners and his expiring immigration terms.
