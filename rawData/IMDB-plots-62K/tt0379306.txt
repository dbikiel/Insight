A 1930s American socialite creates a scandal in the expatriate high society of the Amalfi Coast of Italy when she forms a secretive relationship with a wealthy American unbeknownst to his young wife.
In 1930, Mrs. Erlynne (Helen Hunt), who describes herself as poor and infamous, driven from New York City society by jealous wives, sees a news photo of wealthy Lord Windermere (Mark Umbers) and his young wife (Scarlett Johansson). She heads for the Amalfi Coast to be amongst the rich and famous for "the season" and to snare Mr. Windermere. Gossips twitter as he spends his afternoons with her, his wife blissfully innocent as she blushingly fends off attentions from a young English nobleman, an international playboy who thinks he's in love. Mrs. Erlynne is also pursued by a worldly-wise older English nobleman. Mrs. Windermere's twentieth birthday party approaches, where all plays out amidst numerous amoral Wildean aphorisms.
