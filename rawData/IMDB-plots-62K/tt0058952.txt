Edd Byrnes tries to get an ethnic-music-studies grant to buy instruments for his rock and roll group, the Wigglers. College-finance-committee members Chris Noel, Gail Gilmore, Mikki Jameson and Brenda Benet uncover the scam and tear up the check, but the Wigglers play a Long Beach, California custom-car show in drag and win first prize. The Supremes do "Come to the Beach Ball with Me" and "Surfer Boy;" the Four Seasons sing their 1964 hit "Dawn;" the Hondells sing Brian Wilson's "My Buddy Seat;" the Righteous Brothers do "Baby What You Want Me to Do;" and the Walker Brothers cut loose with "Doin' the Jerk." Gary Kurtz of "Star Wars" fame was the assistant director.
