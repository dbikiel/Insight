The leader of a marching band demonstrates an unusual way of writing music.
Under a set of five telegraph lines, a bandmaster and his marching band of talented female vocalists prepare to sing. But first, the leader needs to arrange the notes and place the G-clef on the lines. There he goes. Now, everything is ready for an unforgettable performance.
A marching band appears, and the band-leader prepares to give them the music for the song he wants them to play. He has prepared a large staff above their heads, and he now creates notes by making duplicates of his own head, placing them on the staff, and completing the notes with sticks and other implements taken from the band members. When he has finished, the players attempt to perform the music that has been written in such an unusual fashion.
A singing teacher, followed by his pupils, meet in the fields some telegraph wires strung on poles. These wires, the professor thinks, would form a very effective musical staff. He carries an enormous key of G which he throws upon the wires to give the proper pitch to his pupils. He forms a measure by fixing his cane in a perpendicular position among the wires which run in parallel direction, thus forming the lines of a staff of music. In order to have notes, he tears off his own head and fixes it among the wires. Thus he obtained the first note of his air. Then he fixes upon this staff several heads corresponding in position to the first part of the tune, "God Save the King." One hears the beating of drums, the heads rearrange themselves and one sees the second line of the air. Another beating of drums, and the heads shift about until they form the third line of music. Satisfied, the professor departs, followed by his pupils. The heads, abandoned among the wires, cast a look at the crowd as it disappears. Immediately they are changed to birds and fly away. This subject, accompanied by the proper music, produces great laughter.
