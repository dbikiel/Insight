After being stabbed with an ancient, germ-infested knife, a doctor's assistant finds himself with an insatiable desire for blood.
Dr. Hess Green, an archaeologist overseeing an excavation at the ancient civilization of Myrthia, is stabbed by his research assistant, who then commits suicide. When Hess wakes up, he finds that his wounds have healed, but he now has an insatiable thirst for blood, due to the knife carrying ancient germs. Soon after, Hess meets his former assistant's wife, Ganja. Though Ganja is initially concerned about her missing husband, she soon falls for Hess. Though they are initially happy together, Ganja will eventually learn the truth about Hess, and about her husband. Will she survive the revelation? Will Hess?
Dr Hess Green [Duane Jones], anthropologist and geologist, is studying the Myrthian culture of Nigeria. Myrthians were human blood drinkers. Green gets a strange dagger from Myrthia and asks research assistant George Meda [Bill Gunn] to help him. When Meda stabs Green with the dagger (Why? "Oh, he's freaking out again"), Green doesn't die; he becomes immortal and needs to drink human blood. When Meda's wife [Marlene Clark] comes looking for Meda, she falls in love with Green. And when she finds her husband's body in Green's freezer, she marries Green!!!! Green makes Mrs. Meda immortal, then goes to a revivalist church to save himself. It's a screwy life being a Myrthian vampire, I guess.
