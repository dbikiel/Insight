Despite all methods of instantaneously masking a clandestine gambling den's shady activities, the risk of getting caught is high, especially when the police thirsts for success. But, sometimes, indulging in pure fun is just too tempting.
Where do all upper-class people and the most respectable and wealthiest members of high society go to blow off some steam? At an illegal and equally exciting clandestine gambling den. However--despite all sophisticated methods of instantaneously masking the shady activities--there's always the risk of getting caught, especially when the local police department is thirsting for a success. But, sometimes, indulging in pure fun is just too tempting.
A combination gambling den and bawdy house is set up so that croupiers, patrons, prostitutes, and the owner can quickly change it all into a mercantile establishment when the cops stage a raid. The women become shop girls and customers, the men become clerks and shoppers. The craps table becomes a long counter. The police do raid the joint, and the nearly-instantaneous conversion into a dry goods store covers all the evidence. The police leave in dismay and disgust. But will they be back? What is their real motive?
