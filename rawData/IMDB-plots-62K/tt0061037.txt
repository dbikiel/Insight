Five short stories loosely dealing with the roles of women in society.
Five short stories loosely dealing with the roles of women in society. A superstar actress travels to a mountain resort, only to evoke jealousy from women and lust from men. A woman offers to take an injured man to the hospital. A widowed father and his son seek for a new wife and mother. A man seeks revenge for a woman's honor. A bored housewife tries to explain to her husband that he's not as romantic as he used to be.
A quintet of vivid sketches, one spectacular female protagonist and a picturesque anthology interpreting the diverse aspects of the modern Italian woman. Starting off with Luchino Visconti's first segment named "La Strega Bruciata Viva" (The Witch Burned Alive), an idolised movie star falls victim of fame and vanity, while on the second short sketch titled "Senso Civico" (Civic Sense) by Mauro Bolognini, an attentive and thoughtful woman offers to transport an injured man to the first-aid station in her car. Next, in Pier Paolo Pasolini's third part named "La Terra Vista Dalla Luna" (The Earth Seen from the Moon), a recently-widowed ageing father and his son, wander Rome's cobbled streets in search of an ideal wife for the former, and a caring mother for the latter. Subsequently, in Franco Rossi's following brief segment entitled "La Siciliana" (The Girl from Sicily), a tragic tale of seduction and typical Sicilian revenge awaits, while in Vittorio de Sica's final chapter named "Una Sera Come Le Altre" (One Evening Like the Others), a frustrated and bored housewife conjures up wild, yet hopeless dreams, longing for her husband's genuine feelings.
