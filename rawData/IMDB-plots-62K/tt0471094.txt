A vicious woman terrorizes a friend who has a seemingly perfect life.
Beth Ferrier is happy in her life - fulfilled as a wife and mother, living in a beautiful home in a safe and tranquil neighborhood. Claudia Hartnell lives across the street and seems to be the perfect best friend - kind, compassionate, and a good listener. Nobody would ever guess that behind Claudia's charming facade lies an insatiable desire to live an idealized life. Nobody would suspect that her relentless childhood obsession is about to turn to murderous rage. Claudia wants everything that Beth holds dear and will use any means necessary to take it all away from her best friend.
