A tragicomic look at an evening in the life of the newly elected President of the Norwegian Esperanto Society and his nervous preparations for his first Annual General Meeting in this position. Not only must he cope with a defeated rival for his position, but his girlfriend is being followed by suitors and must keep her relationship with him a secret or risk their disaffection from the Society. Finally, the turnout is disappointingly small, a promised celebrity has sent his regrets and the sole representative from the press is witness to all of the new President's frustrations and emotional traumas.
