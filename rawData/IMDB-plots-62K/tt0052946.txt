This biography follows the young John Paul from his youth in Scotland and the beginnings of his naval career as a cabin boy to the captaincy of his own ship. In order to escape a possible trial and jail term for killing a mutineer on his ship, Paul is forced to add "Jones" to his name. He rises quickly in the fledgling American Navy during the early days of the Revolution, and his capture of a trove of British war supplies dooms British General Burgoyne at Saratoga greatly aids the American cause. However, when the proud Jones is left without a ship while less competent and experienced officers are given ships, the disgruntled Scotsman goes to General Washington at Valley Forge to tender his resignation. There he undergoes a patriotic epiphany and withdraws his letter, and Washington promises him a ship if he can refit and crew it. Eventually, with Benjamin Franklin's help, he secures a ship from France's Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette which he calls the Bonhomme Richard and ultimately meets the vaunted British battleship of the line, the Searapis, in one of the great naval battles of all time. The story continues with his being loaded to Russia and ultimate death in France.
