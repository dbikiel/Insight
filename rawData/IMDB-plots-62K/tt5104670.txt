A moving psychological portrait of Cambodia decades after a devastating genocide, examining how baksbat (Khmer for "broken courage") continues to impact modern Cambodia.
Cambodia is a nation split between a bright future and a black past, still tending the savage wounds wrought upon its people by the Khmer Rouge and the USA bombers whilst also cultivating a determined and optimistic new generation. This deep and incisive portrait of a vibrant, bustling country moves beyond the verdant hills, ancient wonders and modern metropolises to reveal a past of violence and pain which still lingers not too far below the surface.
