Arrogant spoiled princess Isabella of Gerania haughtily rejects all suitors, even prince Richard of Begonia, whom she liked in a previous anonymous meeting. Finally her exasperated royal father gives her hand to the first-come beggar. Richard disguises himself as such in secret, helped only by his sister Maximiliane, hoping to pull of an operation taming the shrew by making her earn her keep, but gradually despairs as her pride persists.
