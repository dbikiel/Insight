O Contador de Histórias (The Story of Me), a Luiz Villaça;a movie based on the life of Roberto Carlos Ramos, is a story about how affection can change reality. The youngest of 10 brothers, Roberto showed a special talent to tell stories, by changing through narrative his own experiences about frustration into beautiful and touching fables. At age 6, the boy filled with imagination goes to live in a newly opened government institution, which main goal is to help young and poor children. His mother takes him there believing it will guarantee a better future for her child. But the reality of the institution is very different from what was advertised on TV. Roberto, little by little, loses hope. At age 13, after hundreds of escapes, he's considered "irrecoverable", in the words of the headmaster of the facility. However, Roberto proves to be a challenge to the French pedagogue Margherit, who comes to Brazil to work on a research. Determined to make the boy her object of study, she tries to get closer to him. At first, Roberto struggles, but after a traumatic experience, he looks for shelter in Margherit's home. What comes out of it is a relationship based on friendship and tenderness, that will put Roberto's disbelief in his future at check and will challenge Margherit to keep her beliefs.
