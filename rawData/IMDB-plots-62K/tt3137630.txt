A camera crew catches up with David Brent, the former star of the fictional British TV series The Office (2001), as he now fancies himself a rock star on the road.
About 13 years on from his appearance in the documentary series The Office, a documentary film crew is once again following the life of David Brent. He is now working as a rep for cleaning goods distributor but still harbours dreams of making it big in the music business. Acting on this, he takes three weeks off work and tours with a new-look version of Foregone Conclusion, the band he was in in the 90s (he's the only remaining original member, for various reasons...).
It isn't required to have seen the 2001 British TV comedy "The Office" before watching this film. Comedian/writer Ricky Gervais created and starred in the TV series and this film as David Brent. Brent is just as clueless in this film as he was in the earlier TV series. There Gervais played a clueless middle manager in a paper supply company in Slough, England, here he plays a clueless salesman at Lavichem, a cleaning supply company also in Slough. After working for two unexciting companies, Brent wants some excitement and what better way to get excitement is to become a rock musician. He cashes in his retirement, recruits a band, rents a tour bus and takes time off work to tour Slough with his new band. The film follows him on his 'Rock N Roll' tour where it becomes evident that he doesn't have the talent necessary to become a star - or even enough talent to keep from embarrassing his band. The members of his band continue to back him up because he's paying all the bills. Eventually he runs out of money and time so he returns to Lavichem with the idea to save enough money to make another try at his rock-star dream. In both the TV comedy and this film he is followed by a documentary film crew which allows the David Brent character to deliver comments along the way.
