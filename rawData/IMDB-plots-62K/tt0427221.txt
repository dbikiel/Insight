Documentary about Estamira, a 63-year-old woman who's been working for over 20 years at a landfill in Rio de Janeiro. Schizophrenic, but very charismatic, she's the leader of a small community of old people living off garbage and has a very lyrical and philosophical attitude towards life.
In the periphery of Rio de Janeiro, the sixty and something years old Estamira is an insane but happy woman that has been working for more than twenty years in the city dumpster in Gramacho, collecting remains for recycling or personal use. Along the documentary, we see the madness of this woman through her philosophic principles and concepts of life and religion; but further than that, we see that she was a normal married woman abused by her husband and with three daughters and one son, all of them well-raised and normal. In accordance with her older daughter, she told that she was a religious woman that worked in a supermarket; after being raped for the second time in Campo Grande, she became delusional and insane, giving up and blaming God.
