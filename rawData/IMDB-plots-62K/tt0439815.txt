A small town is taken over by an alien plague, turning residents into zombies and all forms of mutant monsters.
From the depths of the endless space, a flaming meteorite crashes into the dark woods of the sleepy town of Wheelsy, South Carolina. As the scorched rock reveals its silent content--a baneful parasitic organism--a subtle alien invasion commences, and the war's unlucky first victim is the town's local businessman, Grant. Little by little, as an internal change transforms Grant into an utterly hideous monstrosity, his wife, Starla, starts to feel that something's been eating at him the last few days. Now, before the unstoppable extraterrestrial attack, no one is safe, and to make matters worse, Grant's transformation is far from over yet. Who can stop the slithering army from outer space?
Near the deer hunting season in the small town of Wheelsy, a meteor falls on the woods with an egg of alien worm. Along the night, the local Starla Grant refuses to have sex with her husband Grant Grant and the upset man goes to a bar to have some drinks. He sees the weird egg on the grass, and when he touches it, the egg releases an alien parasite that dominates Grant's brain. Along the next days, Grant has an insatiable hunger for meat, and his hostage body is transforming. Starla and the local sheriff Bill Pardy try to find a way to stop Grant, the leader of a new breed.
