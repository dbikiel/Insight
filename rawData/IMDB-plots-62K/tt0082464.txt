Local goon, Gerry, hires a yellow mini in Kaitaia using a stolen license. John's wife has just left him and moved to Invercargill. He is devastated and needs to talk to her. He has no transport and needs a ride. Together with the little mini that Gerry names "Pork Pie", they hit the road to travel the length of the country. Their high speed exploits earn them the name "the Blondini gang". The police, however take a dim view of this and make it their mission in life to stop the Blondini boys from reaching their destination.
