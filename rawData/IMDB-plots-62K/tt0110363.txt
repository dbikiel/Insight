A young boy is bequeathed the ownership of a professional baseball team.
When the owner of the Minnesota Twins dies suddenly, his will bequeaths the team to his grandson Billy, a devotee of baseball who, although only 12, has devoured voluminous lore, knows the team intimately, and has shown an uncanny sixth sense of what they need to improve. They hate their manager, so Billy quickly fires the SOB, winning their instant approval. However, this turns to dismay when he announces their new manager: Billy Heywood. How will Billy convince a gang of proud, tough men to stick around and take orders from a kid? On the other hand, what's to lose-- the team has nowhere to go but up.
The Chairman of the Minnesota Twins Baseball team passes away of natural causes and in his will leaves his grandson, Billy Heywood, ownership of the team. Billy, despite being only 12-years-old, is a devotee of the sport, knows the Twins inside out and believes he has what it takes to make the Twins a championship winning team, so he appoints himself the new manager. But will the proud, arrogant players of the team be willing to take orders and tactics from a 12-year-old boy? In an attempt to get the players efforts into the game, he dedicates the season to his Grandfather, and vows to win the Championship with the Minnesota Twins. Is this enough to receive the trust and acceptance of the players, fans and critics of the sport?
