The two foolish little pigs escort Red Riding Hood on a short cut through the woods, against the advice of their bricklayer brother. When they encounter the wolf, Red runs ahead to granny's house and the pigs run home. The wolf gets to granny's house first and scares her into a closet, then dresses as granny. Alerted by his brothers, the smart pig arrives just as granny has pulled Red into the closet with her and takes care of the wolf with the help of some hot coals and popcorn.
