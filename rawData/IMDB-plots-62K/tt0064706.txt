Jim McBride followed his wildly inventive debut, DAVID HOLZMAN'S DIARY, with this thought-provoking documentary about his then-girlfriend, Clarissa Ainley, and her 'marriage of convenience' to another man. "In many respects," states critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, MY GIRLFRIEND'S WEDDING is "the best 'critique' of DAVID HOLZMAN'S DIARY that I know." When Rosebaum interviewed the director for Positif in the 1970s, McBride noted that he was "fond of referring to it as a fiction film, because it was very much my personal idea of what Clarissa was like and not at all an objective or truthful view."
