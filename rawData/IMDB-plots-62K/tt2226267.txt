This heart-stopping documentary exposes a huge health and environmental scandal in our modern industrial system of meat and poultry production. Some scientists have gone so far as to condemn current factory farms as Mini Chernobyls. In the U.S. and elsewhere, the meat and poultry industry is dominated by dangerous uses of arsenic, antibiotics, growth hormones and by the dumping of massive amounts of sewage in fragile waterways and environments. The film documents the vast catastrophic impact their practices have on the environment and public health, as well as the individual lives damaged and destroyed.
