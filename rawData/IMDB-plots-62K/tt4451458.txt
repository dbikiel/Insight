Surrealist filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky tells the story of himself as a young man becoming a poet in Chile, befriending other artists, and freeing himself from the limits of his youth.
Through Alejandro Jodorowsky's autobiographical lens, Endless Poetry narrates the years of the Chilean artist's youth during which he liberated himself from all of his former limitations, from his family, and was introduced into the foremost bohemian artistic circle of 1940s Chile where he met Enrique Lihn, Stella Díaz Varín, Nicanor Parra... at the time promising young but unknown artists who would later become the titans of twentieth-century Hispanic literature. He grew inspired by the beauty of existence alongside these beings, exploring life together, authentically and freely. A tribute to Chile's artistic heritage, Endless Poetry is also an ode to the quest for beauty and inner truth, as a universal force capable of changing one's life forever, written by a man who has dedicated his life and career to creating spiritual and artistic awareness across the globe.
In 1930s Chile, the young dreamer, Alejandro Jodorowsky, thirsts to get out of his unbearable father's shadow, yearning to become a poet. As the wide-eyed teenager discovers Federico García Lorca's poetry, he will reject a preordained life and a future as a medical doctor--and several years later--Alejandro will meet his muse, the punk poetess, Stella Díaz Varín. In the bosom of the bohemian Santiago, the aspiring poet will collect friends and mentors such as the novelist Enrique Lihn and the poet Nicanor Parra, companions to a never-ending pursuit of elegance, enlightenment and Endless Poetry.
