Conceited war correspondent Steve Kimball, desperate to get back to the USA from occupied Paris, reluctantly agrees to chaperone a troupe of stranded, teenaged hepcat entertainers. Plus redheaded Bridget, not a real member of the group...just stranded (and the 16th person on 15 tickets). But Steve has a use for her: to sneak his stories past censorship in "love code." Their shipboard dormitory is also shared by adult glamour girl Kay. Can the kids enlist Kay to keep Steve out of their hair? Can all sorts of complications be far behind?
