A wrongly convicted murderer escapes prison to find the real killer.
The mystery begins when Speight escapes after being found guilty of murder, and his wife, Thelma, believes he is after her because she is in love with another man and has changed her name. Lawyer Bishop and friend, playing a hunch, finds Speight at the scene of the crime and learns he is after the real murderer and not his wife. They shift through several men as suspects, all of whom seem to know his wife rather well.
