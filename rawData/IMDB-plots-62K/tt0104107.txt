A con man bets a shady small-town businessman that his middle-aged boxer can defeat any ten men willing to enter the ring. With Heather Graham, Oliver Platt.
Gabriel Caine has just been released from prison when he sets up a bet with a business man. The business man owns most of a boxing-mad town called Diggstown. The bet is that Gabe can find a boxer that will knock out ten Diggstown men, in a boxing ring, within twenty-four hours. "Honey" Roy Palmer is that man, although at forty-eight, many say he is too old. A subplot was thrown in about Charles Macum Diggs, the heavyweight champion that gave the town its name, and who is now confined to a wheelchair.
