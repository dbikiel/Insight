Despite the fact that Fiona has lived apart from her mother, they lead parallel lives as bi-sexual prostitutes. The meeting of the two women spells tragedy for the mother and hope for the daughter.
The story of Fiona and her mother told in eight chapters. Fiona is abandoned at six months of age, raised in foster and adoptive homes, abused, and, still a teen, hustles on the streets of New York. We watch her use heroin, fall in love with other women, be pursued by men, engage in murderous violence, hide out in a crack house, and decide to leave the city. We see her mother, also a streetwalker and drug user, occasionally talk about her lost daughter. Fiona has a necklace she was clutching when a foundling. Will mother and daughter meet? Is there a silver lining?
