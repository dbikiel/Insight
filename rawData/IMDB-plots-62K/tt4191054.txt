Goblins, elves, fairies and imps, and their misadventures sparked by the battle over a powerful potion.
"Strange Magic," a new animated film, is a madcap fairy tale musical inspired by "A Midsummer Night's Dream." Popular songs from the past six decades help tell the tale of a colorful cast of goblins, elves, fairies and imps, and their hilarious misadventures sparked by the battle over a powerful potion.
Marianne, a fairy princess, discovers her fianc√©e Roland cheating on her the day of their wedding. Vowing never to love again, Marianne dedicates herself to protecting her younger sister, Dawn. When a love potion is stolen from the Dark Forest, the Bog King kidnaps Dawn to hold her until he gets the potion back, intent on destroying it and keeping love out of his kingdom. Marianne arrives to rescue her sister, and in the process forms a bond with the King of the Dark Forest.
A realm is divided between a land of fairies and light, and a land of bog creatures and darkness, living in the dark forest. Primrose flowers, which are a crucial ingredient to love potions, mark the border between the lands. Marianne is a fairy princess and heir to the throne of the Fairy Kingdom, and is engaged to be married to Roland, a handsome warrior who breaks her heart when she discovers him kissing another fairy on their wedding day. Scorned, Marianne vows to never fall in love again. As at the dark forest, the Bog King also shared the same view on love, despite his caring mother Griselda's protests. Sometime later, her sister Dawn, who frequently says she is in love, is distraught regarding the upcoming Spring Ball over which boy she could meet there. Her best friend Sunny, an elf who has a crush on Dawn, tries to cheer her up with a song, but they are nearly devoured by a giant lizard before a hardened Marianne rescues them. Sunny, having fallen through the border of the dark forest, finds a Primrose petal, which he subsequently hides when fleeing the forest..
