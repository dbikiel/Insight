A French-American in Paris lives by sponging off his working friends, and throws a party using borrowed money when his rich American aunt dies, believing firmly in his horoscope.
Pierre Wesselrin is a 40-year-old American who lives in Paris by sponging off his working friends and various wealthy acquaintances. He receives a telegram saying that a rich aunt has died, so he throws a party, using borrowed money of course, and invites all his friends. After discovering that his aunt disinherited him, his luggage is impounded and he is thrown out of his apartment. All his friends are now away for the summer, or are working outside Paris, so he is forced to wander the streets and become a clochard.
Pierre Wesselrin is a French-American composer who will soon turn 40, but hasn't earned any money by his music yet. He believes in astrology and proclaims that his constellation, the Lion, is the sign of conquerors. His horoscope says that before he becomes 40 his life will flounder, but after 40 it will turn either into fortune or into destitution. A few months before reaching the age of 40 he receives a telegram, which says that his very rich aunt has recently died. This means that he and his cousin, Christian, will earn a fortune. He celebrates this with a wild party, but soon he finds out that he won't get any money, because his aunt has bequeathed all of it to his cousin. Totally destitute Pierre moves from one hotel to another, without paying any bills. It's summertime and all his friends have left Paris for vacation. Without any money he is thrown out on the streets, where he soon joins company with another bum at the quay of Seine. The sudden death of his cousin in a car-accident might turn his life once more into a new direction, but his friends cannot find him.
