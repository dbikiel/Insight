Revolves around Soo-hyun and the three sisters. While he is falling in love with the youngest sister Mi-young, he also tries to seduce her two sisters. Everything become complicated.
From writer/director Jang Hyeon-Su (Born to Kill) comes Everybody Has Secrets, a comic tale of sex and secrecy that argues that not all secrets need to be revealed, especially if they can fuel a loving relationship. This remake of a little-known Irish film called About Adam features popular Korean idol Lee Byung-Hun (JSA) as a modern day Don Juan who ends up bedding a trio of sisters, while at the same time irrevocably changing their lives which begs the question, is it a change for the better?
