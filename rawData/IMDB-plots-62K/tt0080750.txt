A working-class boy falls for a girl from a wealthy family, and must compete for her with a rich boy who also wants her.
College student Wes agrees to be a test subject in a psychological experiment involving shock treatments. The experiment goes wrong, but he and the cute scientist Susan who performed the experiment hit it off right away. Unfortunately, she's already engaged to a sleazy rich guy called Whitley whom her elitist mother adores. Wes and Susan get some help in dealing with the situation from her down-to-earth rich granddad who suspects Whitley is only with Susan for her money.
