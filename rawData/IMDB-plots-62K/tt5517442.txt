Mother of many children can't cope with kids who have a pound of explosive inside.
Monkeys, as always, are actively naughty at the zoo. Monkey mom is doing the laundry, and the smallest is drinking milk from a bottle. But the milk is over, Mama the monkey puts the baby in the stroller and goes for the milk to the city. She does not notice how the kids are hiding in the stroller. Along the way, the monkeys crawl out of the stroller and begin to imitate others.
