Upon arriving at Warsaw, Marcin, a young mysterious stranger from afar, enters the lives of hedonistic Ola and her liberal well-off parents. He's got a secret plan and just waits for a convenient moment to make it happen.
Marcin, a young man wants to kill a couple, for reasons unknown. When he arrives at their address he ends up meeting their daughter Ola instead. He heads out for the night, continues to keep an eye on her, insinuates himself into her party plans, and eventually makes a connection with her that allows him to ingratiate himself with her parents the next day. None of the fun, however, detracts him from his initial plan.
