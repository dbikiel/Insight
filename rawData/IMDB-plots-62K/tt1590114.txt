A journey diary that redraws the trip of a European traveler confronted with Famadihana customs.
Famadihana is an ancient Malagasy custom that means "the turning of the dead". A symbol of the importance of the worship of ancestors, and a chance to move the remains of ancestors from their first tomb to their final resting place, it is an occasion for festivities, dance and the sacrifice of zebus. The movie is filmed like the travel journey of a Western traveler in search of these customs. The pages turn, the drawings come to life, and the luxuriant landscapes of Madagascar appear one after another. The celebrations may commence.
