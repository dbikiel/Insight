John Rotit is a happy, content man with a loving wife. Hours later, he's a rock star shooting up heroin. And after that...he's something far more sinister. John unwillingly flashes between three parallel lives in which he knowingly exists in each. He has no clue how or why this phenomenon is occurring, only that he wants it to stop. John's judgment becomes clouded as he'll do anything he can to end his flashes and remain in the one life where he's truly happy.
A man travels between three different time lines, in which he has a different life in each one. He struggles to deal with the constant flashes from one reality to the next, as he strives to figure out a way to remain in the only one where he's truly happy.
