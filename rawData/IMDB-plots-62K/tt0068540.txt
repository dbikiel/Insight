Somewhere in south west Texas, where a christian cult is said to have resided in the past, a deputy sheriff investigates a number of suspicious deaths.
People are disappearing in the outskirts of a Texan town, which leads to loss of business from a lodge. The sheriff dismisses the incident as mere accidents, only worrying about his re-election campaign, but an occult researcher investigates and alleges that a devil worshiping cult might be responsible.
