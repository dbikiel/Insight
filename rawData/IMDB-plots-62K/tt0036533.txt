Radio crime show host "The Fox" finds himself on the trail of a serial killer while a suspect himself.
Wally Benton, "The Fox," master detective on radio, is about to go with his sweetheart to Niagara Falls in order to get married. Unknown to him, his valet has told a newspaper reporter that Benton is "Constant Reader," someone who has sent information to newspapers about murdered people and where to find their bodies, thus making the police look bad. The police are sure that "Constant Reader" is the murderer himself, since no one else could know all of the details. And so they begin a chase after Benton, a chase which leads to old abandoned warehouses and old abandoned mansions. Wally is being chased not only by the police but also by the real "Constant Reader." Can he save his girl, his assistant, and the reporter and solve the crime before either the villain or the police, who have been told to shoot on sight, kill them all?
Red Skelton filmed a series of these "whistling" movies during the 1940's. Whistling In Brooklyn, features witty dialog and lots of sight gags. Wally 'The Fox' Benton (Red Skelton) is the star of a weekly radio mystery program. He innocently gets involved with a gang that is murdering city officials under the pseudonym of Constant Reader in an attempt to take over the city. Through several plot twists, Skelton gets blamed for the murders and goes on the lam with his chauffeur Chester (Rags Ragland), and two pretty girls Carol Lambert (Ann Rutherford, Skelton's fiance) and Jean Pringle (Jean Rogers) who plays the part of a dippy newspaper reporter. Things get crazy when Wally dons a beard and pitches in an exhibition baseball game between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Bearded Beavers. Whistling In Brooklyn also features several of the actual Brooklyn Dodger baseball players.
