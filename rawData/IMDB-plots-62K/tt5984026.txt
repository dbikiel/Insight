In 1964, Jean Ziegler was asked by Che Guevara to fight the "capitalist Monster". Former collaborator of Kofi Annan, professor and writer, Ziegler's books still act as a manifesto to left-wing intelligentsia. At the UN Human Rights Council, he fights against "vulture funds", a new avatar of the "Monster". He goes back to Cuba, in his opinion the mother of all anticapitalist forces. The visit becomes a dialogue between reality and symbolism, confronting his thinking with today's Cuban destiny.
