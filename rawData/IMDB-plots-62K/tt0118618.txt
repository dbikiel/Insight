Al the Angel returns, but this time he visits a small town and manages to halt the losing tradition of the high school football team, also changing forever the lives of two young brothers who have recently lost their father.
The football team Jesse is on is terrible; after the death of his father Jesse quits the team. Then angels come to help the team get better and nobody can see them but Jesse's little brother.
Jesse Harper is the only talented player on his high school football team, but he quits the team after his father dies in an accident. His younger brother Kevin, who realizes that football is the most important thing in Jesse's life, sends a nighttime prayer which is heard by some sports-loving angels who come to the rescue. Now, with the help of the angels, the team wins all the matches, but how can Kevin make people, and especially Jesse, believe in their existence?
