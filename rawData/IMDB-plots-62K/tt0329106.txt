Repentant ex neo-Nazi Ingo Hasselbach's autobiographical experiences are the basis for "Fuhrer Ex". Two friends dream of escaping the oppression of communist GDR in 1980s in Berlin. When they finally make an attempt, however, they are captured by the authorities and imprisoned. In jail, they allow themselves to be indoctrinated into the hate-fueled neo-Nazi movement to try and survive their incarceration. The question is how much they will allow the ideology to dominate them once they've been released. "Fuhrer Ex" examines the value and costs of both personal and political comradeship.
