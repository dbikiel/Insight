Charlie Conrad is ready for college, but the sudden death of his mother and his long-absent father leave him saddled with the adult responsibility of raising his 9-year-old brother.
Justin Lo makes his feature film debut as Charlie Conrad, a 19-year-old history buff with the world on his shoulders. Following the death of his mother, Charlie sets aside his college plans to raise his highly imaginative 9-year-old brother Ben (Booboo Stewart). Isolated from his peers, Charlie accepts his responsibility yet secretly yearns for the freedom and romance associated with youth. Charlie suddenly gets his chance when he meets Jordan Rivers (Nick Bartzen), a charismatic drifter and fellow lost soul. The two of them hit it off immediately, and they soon embark on a tumultuous romance that gives Charlie a taste of the freedom he's been craving. Just as their relationship intensifies, however, Charlie's long-absent father, Doug (Barry Shay), returns to town with his own plans to take care of Ben. Caught in a struggle for Ben and eager to hold on to Jordan, Charlie must finally search his soul and make momentous decisions regarding the future of his family.
