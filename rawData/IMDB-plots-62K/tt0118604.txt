An American man unwittingly gets involved with French werewolves who have developed a serum allowing them to transform at will.
The daughter of the werewolf from AWIL is alive and living in Paris where her mother (from the first film) and stepfather are trying to overcome her lycanthropic disease. A trio of American tourists on a thrill seeking trip around Europe manage to stop her from plunging to her death from the top of the Eiffel tower and are embroiled in a horrific but often hilarious plot involving a secret society of werewolves based in the city and a drug which allows werewolves to change at any time... This time there's no need for a full moon...
Andy is a romantic young American tourist on a visit to Paris and one night he meets Serafine at Eiffel Tower and they fall in love. But soon Andy finds out Serafine is a werewolf.
