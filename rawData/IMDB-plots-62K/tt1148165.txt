In the Summer of 1969 a young man is filled with the life of the idyllic old pearling port Broome - fishing, hanging out with his mates and his girl. However his mother returns him to the religious mission for further schooling. After being punished for an act of youthful rebellion, he runs away from the mission on a journey that ultimately leads him back home.
1969 in Western Australia. Mid-teen Willie Johnson, an aborigine from Broome, attends a Catholic boarding school in Perth, the school under the direction of headmaster Father Benedictus, who uses temptation of the flesh - in the form of food - to bribe his charges. Willie's mother wants Willie to become a priest, something he, at his tender age, has no reason not to want himself, that is until... On a vacation back at Broome, he falls in love at first sight with Rosie, the young woman in town who loves to sing. Not having any experience with girls, he is both not confident enough to tell her that him asking to spend time with her are dates, and jealous of any attention other boys pay to her or visa versa. Back in Perth, some incidents with Father Benedictus and his attraction to Rosie make Willie come to the realization of what he really wants at this stage in life, which includes being at home in Broome. So he runs away and tries to make his way back home. Along the way, he meets an odd assortment of characters, including: Tadpole, a vagabond who claims to be his uncle; Slippery and Annie, traveling hippies, the former who may not be as hippyish as he tries to make his exterior seem; and Roxanne, a lusty desert woman who has a tree of condoms. All the while, Father Benedictus is hot on his trail in wanting to bring Willie back to Perth. In the process, they may all come to some revelations which will fundamentally change their lives.
