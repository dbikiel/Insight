A rock climber tries to save the day when a mysterious white gas envelops an entire district in Seoul, South Korea.
Yong-nam (Jung-suk Jo) was one of the best rock climbers in college but hasn't had much luck elsewhere after graduation. He has failed to get a job for many years and has to rely on his parents just to get by. For his mother's 70th birthday, he insisted on having the party at Dream Garden because his old crush, Eui-ju (Yoon-ah Im) works there. When a disaster strikes, covering an entire district in Seoul with mysterious white gas, he has to use all of his rock climbing skills with the help of Eui-ju to get everyone to safety.
