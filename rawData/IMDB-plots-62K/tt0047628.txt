The story is about heiress of the circus family who organizes show "Let's get married" right in the cage for the tigers.
Famous motorcycle racer Fyodor Yermolaev was invited to the circus for the "deadly trick": to make a leap on a motorcycle under the dome. His assistant - a quiet gentle Lena (Ludmila Kasatkina) - dreams of becoming a tiger tamer. Their trick has a grandiose success, and Yermolaev falls in love in an unknown modest circus actor. At the same time, the regular tamer-alcoholic is dismissed. The tigers growl and frighten. Lena enters the cage and - after training them, goes to the arena.
