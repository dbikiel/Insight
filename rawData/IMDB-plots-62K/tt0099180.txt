Doctors Herbert West and Dan Cain discover the secret to creating human life and proceed to create a perfect woman from dead tissue.
In Peru, Dr. Herbert West and Dr. Dan Cain are medical volunteers in a civil war with the assistant Francesca Danelli and they are researching how to create human life from dead tissue using wounded soldiers as guinea pigs. They return to Miskatonic Hospital and Dan treats a terminal patient, Gloria, and gets close to her. When the snoopy Lt. Leslie Chapham investigates the Miskatonic Massacre, he learns that body parts are missing in the morgue, and Herbert and Dan become his prime suspects. But Herbert kills the lieutenant and revives him with the serum. Meanwhile, Dr. Graves finds the head of Dr. Carl Hill and the green substance that the deceased doctor stole from Herbert, and uses the serum to resurrect Dr. Hill's head. When Gloria dies, Herbert and Dan use her head, with Meg's heart and parts of other women to create the perfect woman. But Lt. Chapham teams up with Dr. Hill to seek revenge against the crazy scientists.
Eight short months after the atrocious massacre at Miskatonic University in Re-Animator (1985), the obsessed genius, Dr Herbert West, and his once-reluctant associate, Dr Dan Cain, still find themselves trying to crack the unfathomable secrets of death. With new appalling ideas and yet another daring plan to give life to the perfect specimen, the visionary West experiments with human limbs in Dan's secret basement laboratory, hell-bent on reanimating a mix-and-match woman: the Bride. Now--as the young alchemists' arch-nemesis, the disembodied Dr Hill, still thirsts for revenge--an army of hideous living-dead creations threatens to terminate not only the doctors' audacious project but also their lives. Is Dr West's miraculous green reagent worth dying for?
