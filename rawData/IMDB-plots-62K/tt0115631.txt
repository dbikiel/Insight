Black baseball greats, Satchel Paige and Josh Gibson, vie to be the first afro-American major leaguer, only to see the outspoken rookie, Jackie Robinson, be chosen.
Satchel Paige and Josh Gibson are the greatest players in the Colored leagues, and everyone expects that one of them will make the leap to the Major Leagues, now that there is talk of integration. But, unexpectedly, it's the rookie with the army record, Jackie Robinson, that gets tapped to be the first.
The true story of the friendship between three of the greatest Negro League Players of all time (Jackie Robinson, Satchel Paige, and Josh Gibson) and how things change when Robinson is chosen to break the color barrier in the Major Leagues.
The friendship between Baseball Negro League pitcher Satchel Paige and catcher Josh Gibson is tested as both men strive to become the first black baseball players in professional baseball in 1945. Brooklyn Dodger's owner Branch Rickey chooses Jackie Robinson instead.
In 1946 when Black baseball players were still not yet allowed to play in the major league, Brooklyn Dodger owner Branch Rickey decides it's time to allow them in. He establishes a team in the Negro League, and every great player in that league knows that Rickey plans to bring to the majors. And the two men who believe that they're on top of the list are Sachel Paige and Josh Gibson. But Rickey wants not only good players but good men and he feels that they're not. And one of Rickey's scouts sees a good prospect in rookie, Jackie Robinson.
