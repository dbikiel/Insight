A young man returns to his hometown to look for his missing sister.
Erik has to return to the rural village where he grew up, when he is told that his younger sister Sussie has disappeared without a trace. On returning, Erik gets mixed up in a quirky story including stolen money, drugs and a local policeman who prefers to look the other way.
When Slim Susie goes missing, her brother Erik returns to his childhood village in Swedish VÃ¤rmland to try to find her. Soon after his arrival, he finds himself in a seedy whirlwind of greed, lies and local madness. Beneath the surface, he finds that everything has changed and he can't shake the feeling that no one seems to be concerned with the disappearance of Slim Susie. Not even the one police detective in town. Finally, Erik has to face the disturbing fact that his image of the sweet and congenial little sister he was so fond of is something of the past... SLIM SUSIE is a gangster comedy driven by a wide range of surreal and twisted characters combined with a quick-paced dialogue. The story weaves its way deep within the small rural community in which Erik's childhood best friend has turned into a dopey video freak, the retirement home conceals a major drug centre and the proprietor of the video store is now in fact a local "Godfather".
