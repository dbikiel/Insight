Tasked by his editor, American reporter Henry M. Stanley travels to a dangerous and uncharted region of East Africa to find the missing Scottish pioneer missionary Dr. David Livingstone.
When American newspaperman and adventurer Henry M. Stanley comes back from the western Indian wars, his editor James Gordon Bennett sends him to Africa to find Dr. David Livingstone, the missing Scottish missionary. Stanley finds Livingstone ("Dr. Livingstone, I presume.") blissfully doling out medicine and religion to the happy natives. His story is at first disbelieved. When Livingstone later dies, Stanley returns to continue the good doctor's work (which, of course, never really happened).
In the late 1860s, newspaperman Henry M. Stanley agrees to go to Africa to find Dr. David Livingston. The good doctor has been reported dead but Stanley's employer, James Gordon Bennet, publisher of the New York Herald doesn't believe. As he is fond of saying, he likes to make the news while others wait for it to happen. Stanley goes first to Zanzibar to organize his safari deep into uncharted Africa. There he becomes enamored with the beautiful Eve Kingsley. He sets off with his sidekick Jeff Slocum and they face many hazards along the way including illness and irate tribesmen. After a year, with only the thoughts of Eve to keep him going, he finally comes across Dr. Livinston, alive and well. He's quite impressed with the work Livingston is doing and eventually returns to England in glory. There however Stanley is met with skepticism but eventually decides to return to Africa to continue Livingston's good work.
