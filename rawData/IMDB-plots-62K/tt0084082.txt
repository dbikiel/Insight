Three postal workers and their dysfunctional families interact over cups of tea and Sunday dinner.
Three postal workers and their dysfunctional families interact over cups of tea and Sunday dinner. Stan, Gordon, and Harold sort mail. While the clueless Harold's at work, Stan nips round for loveless sex with Harold's near-sighted, romance-starved wife, June. When Gordon's out, Hazel invites Stan in for tea, randy talk, and to show off her newly-thin figure. Motor-mouthed, intrusive social workers want Stan to spend time with his teenage daughter, Tina, "fostered out" since Stan's divorce. One Sunday, Hazel invites Stan and Tina to dinner; Gordon and Hazel argue; it's on to Stan's, where June shows up wanting a private talk. She's miserable. Tina mutely looks on.
