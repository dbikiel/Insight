Mike has felt alienated and alone for as long as he can remember, until a new boy arrives at his school - awakening feelings and a world of possibilities he'd never before dared to dream of.
When Mike's English teacher pairs him up for a class assignment on Romeo and Juliet with the new kid William, Mike can't believe his luck. However as the two spend more and more time working together on a monster movie version of the Bard's classic tale, they both soon realize their feelings for one another may be more powerful than either of them is truly ready for.
