Rocknroll concert doc following the Stones on their 2016 tour, culminating in their historic stop in Havana, Cuba.
The film follows the Rolling Stones across South America and Mexico and finally ends with their historical concert in Cuba. It begins with the band rehearsing and discussing what it takes to "get the rust out" before they tour. They seemed to hit all the major countries in South America before moving onto Mexico. Clips of them performing their most famous hits in huge concert venues are effectively interspersed with shots of the local culture and scenery of the various countries they toured. The energy of their fans is contagious. It also documents the great difficulty they had being the first rock and roll band to perform (for free) in Cuba for many decades. Only one of their setbacks included being preempted from their original concert date by President Obama's historic visit. Hint: when you see the credits start to roll, stay seated. The Rolling Stones perform several more songs after the credit have rolled.
