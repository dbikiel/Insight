An aircraft factory worker goes on the run after being wrongly accused of starting a fire that killed his best friend.
Los Angeles aircraft worker Barry Kane evades arrest after he is unjustly accused of sabotage. Following leads, he travels across the country to New York City trying to clear his name by exposing a gang of fascist-supporting saboteurs led by apparently respectable Charles Tobin. Along the way, he involves Pat Martin, eventually preventing another major act of sabotage. They finally catch up with Frank Frye, the man who actually committed the act of sabotage at the aircraft factory.
When sabotage destroys part of an aircraft plant, plant worker Barry Kane is blamed for the crime falsely. Determined to clear his name, he sets out to track down the man he believes to be the actual saboteur, the mysterious Frank Fry. He chases Fry across the western deserts to New York City, where he discovers a plot by a group of anti-American fascists, and the two men confront each other atop the Statue of Liberty.
A suspicious fire destroys a Los Angeles based military aircraft factory. An employee at the factory, Barry Kane, whose best friend perished in the fire, is implicated as the saboteur. Kane believes that a man that he met at the factory site that day by the name of Frank Frye is the true saboteur. Frye was acting as if he was an employee at the factory, but records show no employee by that name. With only memory of an envelope with Frye's name and address as a lead, Kane goes on the run from the police to track down Frye. Kane's search for Frye takes a turn when he meets Patricia Martin. Initially suspect of Kane, Pat ends up believing Kane's story and trusting him as a person. In their search for the truth in an effort to clear Kane's name, they discover a plot much larger and more dangerous than Kane could have ever imagined when he started his quest.
