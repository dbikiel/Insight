A career assassin becomes haunted by one of her victims following a near fatal injury to her brain. Becoming a rogue assassin settling the score with her former mob employers, chaos and power struggles ensue.
Renowned comic-book auteur Ed Brubaker, writer of The Death of Captain America, spins a pulpy yarn custom-made for death-defying star Zoe Bell (Death Proof). In this pinnacle of the grindhouse renaissance, Bell stars as Eve, a ruthless assassin who, in the midst of a hit, gets stabbed in the head before accidentally killing a young girl. She survives the ordeal only to be plagued by visions of her past victims. Now with a conscience and unable to work, Eve realizes she must track down her former bosses before some unspeakably sinister hitman inevitably comes to erase her existence.
