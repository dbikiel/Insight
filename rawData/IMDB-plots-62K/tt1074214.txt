A grieving daughter tries to arrange her father's funeral, while putting up with all of his ex-wives.
Henry Lefay has been married before. Depending on how you count, he's been married either five or six times. So when Henry is vacationing in Mexico and gets killed in a para-sailing accident, things get awfully complicated for all the wives involved. His daughter, Barbie, feels guilty for getting mad at him over his womanizing ways, and she feels responsible for keeping the funeral an honorable and dignified affair. But one crazy ex-wife, one hateful ex-wife, two first wives, one current wife, and one future wife all have their own plans for how Henry Lefay should be put to rest.
