Public disapproval of politics and politicians is at an all time high, and for good reason. Cynicism and distrust are the hallmarks of this public disenchantment.

ELECTILE DYSFUNCTION: INSIDE THE BUSINESS OF AMERICAN CAMPAIGNS is a must see for anyone concerned about the future of democratic societies everywhere.
