The wealthy Arden Stuart is bored in a party; after refusing the wedding proposal of Tommy Hewlett, she drives her car with her driver to a lonely place. She has one night stand with him and returns to the party; then she witnesses the driver being fired by a relative and committing suicide. In a rainy day, Arden goes to an exposition and meets the painter and aspirant boxer Packy Cannon. They sail to the South Seas together in his sailboat and Arden falls in love for him. However, a couple of months later, Packy dumps her and brings her back to her city, traveling to China alone. The heartbroken Arden is proposed again by Tommy and gets married with him. Three years later, Arden meets Packy by chance and becomes divided between her unconditional love for Packy and the love for her son.
In the Roaring Twenties, the double standard is alive and well: wives stay home playing bridge, husbands party with flappers and then lie about where they've been. Arden Stuart wants something else: freedom, equality, and honesty in love. She tries first, with tragic results, with a chauffeur. Then, though her long-time friend Tommy Hewlett repeatedly asks her to marry him, she finds what she's looking for in a spur-of-the-moment encounter with Packy Cannon, a pugilist turned painter who's sailing off to the South Seas. A few years later, Packy, Tommy, and Arden must sort out love, devotion, and propriety. Can it be done in honesty, or will social standards dictate deceit?
