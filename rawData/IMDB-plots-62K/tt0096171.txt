Mark Harmon is a washed-up baseball player who is called back home to handle the ashes of his childhood sweetheart/ first love who had committed suicide. As he searches for what to do with them, he remembers the past and the relationship they had. In doing so he finds himself again.
A washed up, middled-aged ballplayer recalls the summer his father died, his mother attempted a one night stand, and he and his best friend lost their virginity, as he travels back to his childhood home to collect the earthly remains of a woman whom he hasn't seen for twenty years, yet whose influence has hung over him his entire life.
