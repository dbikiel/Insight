A young girl and her father move into an old house haunted by the presence of a dead former resident and her beloved cat.
Wes Merritt and his daughter Natalie (14) get more than they bargained for when they buy an old house that was formerly inhabited by the nice old Mrs. Ashboro and her pet cat, Margaret. When strange things start happening in the house, all fingers point to the presence of Margaret, who died the same day as Mrs. Ashboro. But why has she come back to haunt them?
Ghost Cat is a "cute mystery". It won't have you sitting on the edge of your chair, but it won't give you nightmares either. I found myself watching it late one night when I couldn't sleep. I don't know why Netlfix calls it a "Thriller", but it it is a mystery that the whole family can watch, or if you just want to watch a "cute mystery". Its easy to fall in love with Margaret the cat.One thing I didn't get was right at the beginning when Mrs. Ashboro and her cat Margaret are alive and well. According to Mrs. Ashboro's nephew, she is elderly and sickly. Then all of a sudden Mrs. Ashboro dies, and Margaret her cat dies shortly thereafter, without showing any signs of any illness. Seems likely her nephew must have had something to do with the death(s), I think they could have expanded a little bit more about that, and it would have added to the mystery and explained why Margaret comes back as a ghost to make sure the money hungry nephew "gets his".
