The telling of an Inuit legend of an evil spirit causing strife in the community and one warrior's endurance and battle of its menace.
Centuries ago, in what would become the Canadian Arctic, Atuat is promised to the malevolent Oki, son of the leader of their tribe. But Atuat loves the good-natured Atanarjuat, who ultimately finds a way to marry her. Oki's sister, Puja also fancies Atanarjuat, and when she causes strife between him and his brother Amaqjuaq, Oki seizes the opportunity to wreak a terrible revenge on Atanarjuat.
Long ago in the Arctic territory of the Inuit nation, an evil spirit is summoned by a miscreant shaman to spread violence and discord, which leads to the death of the local chief, Kumaglak, at the hands of the usurper, Sauri who also proceeds to break the spirit of his other rival, Tulimaq. Years later, that conflict continues even when Tulimaq's sons, Amaqjuaq, the Strong One and Atanarjuat, the Fast Runner, have become the best hunters of their people. Sauri's short-fused son, Oki, becomes profoundly jealous of the brothers, and this increases when Atanarjuat fairly wins his betrothed. The conflict reaches its climax when an indiscretion on Amaqjuaq's part sparks an act of murderous vengeance that leaves Amaqjuaq dead and Atanarjuat fleeing naked into the wilderness to face certain death by exposure. Yet for all these events the curse has caused, Atanarjuat soon learns that there are forces that are coming to help him. However, he must also make fateful decisions that will determine the fate of him and his people.
