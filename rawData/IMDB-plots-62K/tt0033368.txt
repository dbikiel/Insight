Lopez is a bandit who has stolen the herd at Gil's ranch, so Hardy is about to foreclose. But Lucia has come back from New York and Gil is happy until he meets her husband, Morgan. Saying that they are friends, Morgan wants to buy the ranch before Hardy forecloses, and Gil will sell, but Lopez shows up with all his men and holds them all captive. Lopez has his own law, carried out with a 44 - and he plans to settle everything according to his vision of life.
