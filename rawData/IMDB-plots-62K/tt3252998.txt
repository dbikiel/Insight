A rebellious Goth girl embarks on a road trip across Texas with a suicidal young man in an effort to find her little sister.
A quirky, coming-of-age dramedy about Scout, a rebellious, slightly bad-ass fifteen-year-old girl from the wrong side of the tracks who convinces a wealthy suicidal mental patient to go on a road trip with her across West Texas to track down her little sister who's been taken by the father who abandoned them. At its heart this is a story about family and how two unlikely misfits come together to create their own family.
