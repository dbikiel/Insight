The life of a Finnish couple changes after they win the lottery.
Eevi works in a beauty parlor, leading a humdrum life in the suburbs of Helsinki with his husband Kari, a wannabe rocker. After the jackpot, the couple agrees to carry on with their lives as before, without telling anyone about the stroke of luck. But the money is burning holes in their pockets and that's hard to hide. Their opinions about themselves and their relationship are put to the test. Everyone seems now to have a strange attitude towards them - although they try to pretend to be the same people as before. Do the millions bring happiness after all?
