A California research institute is performing a teleportation experiment to send their military research team to Stuttgart, Germany. But something goes wrong, and the team ends up at the center of the earth, where they just manage to send off a distress signal before being hunted by a dinosaur. Joseph Harnet (Greg Evigan), head scientist in CA, contacts Emily Radford (Dedee Pfeiffer), sister of the missing unit's leader and head of a deep bore drill experiment, for help in rescuing the stranded team. The two mount a rescue operation, drilling down to the earth's core to save the girls before it's too late. In the mean time the stranded group are doing their best to survive in the deadly environment.
