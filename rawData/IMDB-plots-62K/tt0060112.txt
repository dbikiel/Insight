Ellen Gordon, a New York executive's mistress, falls for the executive's young business associate when he is accidentally sent to use the apartment where the executive and Ellen meet every Wednesday. More complications arise when the executive's wife shows up with plans to redecorate the apartment.
Wealthy middle-aged businessman John Cleves of Short Hills, New Jersey lies to his wife Dorothy once a week and stays in New York City to have an affair. Twentysomething art-gallery clerk Ellen Gordon inadvertently aids him in his lies, to her disgust. But eventually she falls for his charms in his constant pursuit of her to become his exclusive Wednesday city liaison. Their arrangement includes John's company buying her apartment--for her to live in. Complications ensue when John's secretary sends one of the company's out-of-town clients, Cass Henderson, to the suite. Cass quickly realizes that Ellen is John's kept mistress--just before Dorothy arrives at the suite and assumed that Ellen and Cass are a married couple, a lie which they both perpetuate to protect Ellen and John's affair. The four end up spending an awkward day together, each beginning to figure out what they want in life. The question becomes if each gets what he/she wants.
