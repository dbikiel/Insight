A hardened detective in the Flying Squad of London's Metropolitan police. Based on the '70s UK TV show.
Jack Regan is a slobbish, old style cop whose unsubtle methods usually get results, to the annoyance of internal affairs officer Lewis, who would be even more annoyed if he knew that Regan was having an affair with his young wife, policewoman Nancy. After Regan disobeys orders and a shoot-out in central London following a bank hold-up ends in carnage, he is stripped of office and briefly imprisoned. However, thanks to the loyalty of his young protege George Carter and a little string pulling from his superior Frank Haskins, Regan is released to bring down the villains in a gun battle at Gravesend marina, ensuring the continued existence of his department - the Sweeney.
Tearing up the streets of London, The Sweeney is a stylish, exhilarating action thriller proving sometimes you have to act like a criminal to catch a criminal. Armed and dangerous, the Sweeney Flying Squad are old school crime fighters enforcing the law. Led by legendary detective Jack Regan and his loyal partner, they have their own unique way of operating and always get results. With a bank heist in progress and his old enemy making a reappearance on the London crime scene, Regan will do whatever it takes to get the job done, even defying orders from his no-nonsense boss.
Tasked with bringing down criminal organisations by means of brutal and unrestrained force, Detective Jack Regan's elite Flying Squad, or "The Sweeney", uses unorthodox methods to get results. While under scrutiny for tearing up London, Jack's team investigates a combined jewellery heist that ended up in murder, suspecting that the mastermind behind the killing is a familiar villain who is up to his old habits; however, his alibi is rock-solid. Does the Flying Squad have what it takes to finish the job once and for all?
