The tale about the brave hare - long ears, slanting eyes, short tail. He was so authoritative like a boss of all forests that even the wolf scared him.
This story began in an ordinary village hut. They lived there, a grandmother with two grandchildren. The boy and girl talked about who is braver and who is afraid of something. And suddenly they saw a little mouse and were very scared. Grandmother scolded them so that they would not be afraid, and began to tell an instructive tale. In a distant forest, lived the Hare. And he was afraid of everyone and everything - this was a little coward. From morning till night he did nothing but shiver with fear. Even his relatives laughed at him, and soon the Hare got tired of all this, and he decided to prove that he was the most courageous.
