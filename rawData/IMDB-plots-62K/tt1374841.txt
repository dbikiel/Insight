Love never sounded so good, until Corey must decide between two love interests and whether he wants to give up the joys of the single life.
Corey enjoys the single gay life, while searching for love (or at least a connection) in such places as the gym, beach and even a singing chat-room. When two love interests, co-worker Derek and ex-boyfriend Nathan, pursue Corey at the same time, he must decide between them. In a world of four sexy Dancers, along with his roommate Rebecca and her girlfriend, Sam, Corey explores his priorities and celebrates the joys of dating in this delightful musical.
