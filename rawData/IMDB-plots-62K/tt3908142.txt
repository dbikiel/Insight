A modern-day witch uses spells and magic to get men to fall in love with her, with deadly consequences.
Elaine, a beautiful young witch, is determined to find a man to love her. In her gothic Victorian apartment she makes spells and potions, and then picks up men and seduces them. However her spells work too well, and she ends up with a string of hapless victims. When she finally meets the man of her dreams, her desperation to be loved will drive her to the brink of insanity and murder. With a visual style that pays tribute to Technicolor thrillers of the 1970s, THE LOVE WITCH explores female fantasy and the repercussions of pathological narcissism.
The witch Elaine moves to a small town expecting to find her prince charming. She befriends the local Trish that introduces her husband Richard to her. Soon Elaine seduces Wayne, but her spell is too strong. Then, Elaine seduces a man and he does not resist to her charm and commits suicide. Detective Griff investigates the case and stumbles upon Elaine that believes he is the love of her life. Will Griff resist to Elaine's spell?
In the hope of finding true love, the statuesque and raven-haired young witch, Elaine, settles in a classic Victorian home somewhere in a scenic small town in northern California. By stirring mysterious magic potions and using intricate ancient rituals, the single-minded femme fatale is willing to go to great extremes to find the perfect replacement for her recently deceased husband and to finally fulfil her insatiable desire. However, as Elaine's almost pathological obsession starts leaving an ever-growing trail of love-smitten men in her wake, inevitably, an inquisitive detective will soon disrupt her spell. Is Elaine destined to find her Prince Charming?
