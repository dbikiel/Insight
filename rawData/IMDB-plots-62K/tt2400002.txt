Two teenage men fall in love, surrounded by the poverty and the marginalization of their country are forced to change their lives and take big risks.
Cuba is not a country for young gays. Teen rent boy Reinier falls in love with a mate in the slum soccer field at their neighbourhood in Havana. Although obsessed with moneymaking to hold up his baby, teen wife and wife's granma, gambler Reinier always fails in getting the stoke of luck he looks for. At the same time he cannot help being infatuated by Yosvani. Handsome Yosvani will give up his wealthy -and elder- girlfriend whom he hooked to pay him a lavish life in the big city, and the works he makes for her father, a loan thug, so much in love he is with Reinier. But the boys would fight hard to keep this love in the reckless Havana streets.
Two Cuban boys on the edge of marginality fight to lead a life together. But it's hard for both: one has to work as a shark beating father-in-law debtors. The other prostitutes himself in the streets to fulfill his family's duties... In an island where baseball was the king, soccer seems to be the only way to escape.
