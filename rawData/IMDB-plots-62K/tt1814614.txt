A modern, musical spin on the tale of Cinderella that follows a high school girl who falls for a boy at her Performing Arts school.
Cyrano De Bergerac meets Cinderella. Over-worked, harried, and terrified of being put back in foster care, 17-year-old Katie (Lucy Hale) does her stepmother and step-siblings' bidding without complaining. Vocally gifted, Katie feels particularly upset when forced to lay down singing tracks so that her untalented stepsister, Bev Van Ravensway, can hopefully win a recording contract. Bev wants to sign with Kensington Records - whose company President, Guy Morgan, is scouting for new spectacular talent at a talent showcase for the performing arts department at a prestigious private school.
