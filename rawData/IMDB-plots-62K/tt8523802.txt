"Alone at sea" is a first feature-length documentary tracing Eric Bellion's psychological journey during his race on the Vend√©e Globe 2016-2017, a yacht race around the globe, single-handed and without assistance. Eric Bellion filmed himself during the 99 days of his race. He has never sailed solo for more than 6 days. This is an unprecedented immersive document of a man facing himself, loneliness and natural elements. No voice-over, no additional image or music, the novice sailor gets the spectator into a true initiatory journey around the world with his boat and himself. Here is a non-mixed version of the movie.
