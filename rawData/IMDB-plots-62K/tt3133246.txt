When Clark and Will meet Alison and Ida in a wine bar, the foursome struggle to have the most fun that four, bickering, barely married, pre-middle-aged, decidedly dysfunctional adults are capable of having.
Ida, a beautiful mess obsessing over her marital separation, shows up at her sister Alison's for a visit a week too early. Alison is well used to cleaning up after Ida, and settles them both at a local wine bar. There they meet Clark, fresh from signing his divorce papers and sporting his favorite sweatpants, and his friend Will: charming, glib and avoiding his pregnant bride. Recognizing their similarities yet excited by the differences, the foursome climb into a party limo and navigate their way through embarrassing confessions, pot pharmacies, and covert skinny dipping; balancing an undercurrent of sexual tension and the sobering knowledge that they may have left their lives behind for this night, but they would have to return to them come morning.
