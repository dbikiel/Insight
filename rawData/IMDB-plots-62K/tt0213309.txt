A schoolboy gets into a fairy tale with the help of a librarian and DIY book. But life in the magical land is not as easy as it seems.
Schoolboy Vovka dreamed of a fabulous life. With the help of tips from the "Make it Yourself" reference book, the librarian creates a painted boy - Vovka's twin - and sends him to the Dream Kingdom, existing in the book of fairy tales. The Fabulous Tsar painting the fence tells Vovka to cut off his head for parasitism.
