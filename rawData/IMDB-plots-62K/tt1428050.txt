Have you ever wondered how your old schoolmates are? Perhaps the guy next to you, who is doing time in jail at the moment, still thinks you are his best and only friend. Perhaps your first crush might've been interested in you all these years but was too afraid to tell you that. Perhaps, if it were not too late already, the bullied one would've done everything differently.WHAT BECAME OF US is a film about class reunion. It's a film about three things that have forced childhood friends to face each other and their common past once again, despite the consequences: fear, love and the debt of gratitude.
