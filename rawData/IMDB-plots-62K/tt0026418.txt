Al Howard may be a star on Broadway, but he is no longer welcomed by any producer. It seems that he just trots off to Mexico any time he wants causing shows to close and producers to lose money. When his sister Molly can no longer find Al work, she teams him up with talented Dorothy for a club date in Chicago. Flush with another success, Al wants to open his own club on Broadway, so he borrows money from a gangster to open the show. Al has Dorothy, who he ignores, the gangsters dough and the gangster's sweetie Luana. All he has to do is keep them all happy, but Luana wants Al.
