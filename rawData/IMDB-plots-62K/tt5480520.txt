Two antagonistic brothers decide to smuggle drugs into their native Iceland using a young Polish girl as their mule.
Sharp-suited Erik represents the aspirational face of modern Iceland. Atli, a petty criminal just released from prison, is stuck in a downward spiral. The distance between these two very different brothers vanishes when the duo teams up to smuggle cocaine into Iceland, inside plastic pellets swallowed by a young Polish mule, Sofia. But things go wrong when rule-breaking cop Lena starts closing in on them and Sofia falls sick. With the drugs yet to reach their destination and a rival gang demanding a slice of the action, time is a luxury that the brothers can't afford. Charismatic anti-hero Erik's ability to stay one step ahead is tested to the limit - how many lives is he willing to sacrifice to sustain his own?
