After their adventures in Aqu√≠ llega Condemor (el Pecador de la Pradera) (1996), Condemor and Lucas take a ship to Europe, but it sinks, and they save themselves from being drowned by climbing on a coffin. Floating on it, they arrive on the shore, where a group of spooky, ghostly characters mistake Condemor for Count Dracula, whose arrival they have been expecting for 200 years.
