A trio of moronic aliens crash-land on Earth and become celebrities, while a fourth alien, who arrives separately, finds himself ignored.
3 aliens get a bit of their 'friend', Bernard, hacked off. Bernard keeps making the prat of himself play space ball. It's while he is playing space ball that the 2 others start playing around with the ship's controls. They accidentally disconnect his part of the ship, leaving him stranded whilst they crash into a large blue planet close by...
A space ship stops at an intergalactic fuel station. While the captain's refueling, one of his idiotic companions plays with the controls and accidently starts the ship and crashes into the earth. This causes a sensation: the media celebrates the extraterrestrials, the military interrogates them for eternal wisdom. However soon they recognize that the fellows are dumb as bricks - although some generals believe it's just a mask.
