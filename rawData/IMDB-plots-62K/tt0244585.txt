Nirmala Gupta runs her household and family in a very strict and authoritarian manner. While most of her family resent this, they do obey her and carry out her instructions, so as to be on her good side. Things start to change after her second son gets married to Anju. Manju, Anju's sister, comes over to stay for a few days with the Gupta family, and is accepted by everyone except Nirmala. Nirmala's third son intends to marry Manju. But Manju does not like the manner in which his mom bosses everyone along, and feels some changes are needed in the Gupta household.
