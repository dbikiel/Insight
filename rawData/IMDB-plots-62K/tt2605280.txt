The main hero of the story is Filip (Filip CÃ­l), a boy dogged by bad luck ever since his birth. All because his father tried to outwit Fortune herself, thus calling her wrath down on himself and - what's worse - on his son as well. To make things even worse, Philip falls in love with Fortune's lost daughter Hannie. In an effort to win her love, and also in order to shake off the bad luck with which he's bedeviled, Philip sets out into the wide world. Of fateful importance is his encounter with a man suffering from a strange addiction: lying (Ivan Trojan). He has lied his way through life so far that he has forgotten his name, and calls himself Anybody. Surprisingly it is this funny crony who helps Philip win the uneven struggle for his sweetheart.
