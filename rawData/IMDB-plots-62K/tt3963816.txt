When a bank is hit by a brutal heist, all evidence points to the owner and his high-powered clients. But as a group of FBI agents dig deeper into the case - and the deadly heists continue - it becomes clear that a larger conspiracy is at play.
As several branches of Cincinnati's Hubert National Bank are hit by a string of brutal and well-orchestrated bank robberies, FBI's special agent, Jonathan Montgomery, along with his partner, Stockwell, and the inexperienced operative, Wells, try to shed light on a seemingly straightforward case of armed robberies. However, little by little--as the sparse evidence point to the organisation's powerful CEO, Jeffrey Hubert--it becomes obvious that a mysterious and well-connected player will do anything in his power to keep his guilty secrets safe. Does the secretive banker know more than he is letting on?
