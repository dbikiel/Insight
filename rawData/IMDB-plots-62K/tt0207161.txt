Two single parents, one man and one woman, along with their kids, have to involuntarily share a house for their holidays.
A residence on Balboa holiday island gets rented to two families, who meet while fighting for first spot on the ferry. Restaurant chef Matthew 'Matt' Farragher work long hours, but is such fun when at home that cheerful son Lewis and nagging daughter Daphne still love him to death. German genetics researcher Dr. Julia Weiland raised her sons from an American father, adolescent Thomas and preteen Max, well-behaved but boring. Her lab partner and fiancée Russel's true passion is GM vegetables. All the boys bond naturally, despite Julia's over-protective objections. Matt coaches Thomas on his love-life and Lewis teaches Max sailing. Bridging the gorge between the parents will take much more - what will some drama do for them all?
The divorced American chef Matthew "Matt" Farragher takes two week vacation to spend with his son Lewis and his daughter Daphne Farragher in the Balboa Island, in Panama. The German researcher of the genetically modified vegetables Dr. Julia Weiland is also taking vacation in Balboa with her sons Thomas and Max and her boring fiancé Russell. Matt gives freedom to his children and has fun with them while the uptight Julia raises her sons with rigid discipline. While driving to the ferry to the island, Matt and Julia have an argument. Soon they learn that they both rented the same house by the sea due to a mistake of the real estate. Further, the hotels and island are completely booked and they need to share the house. However, along the days their initial animosity begins to change while their children get along with each other very well. But Russell wants to marry Julia and Matt's girlfriend Felice wants to go one step ahead in their relationship.
