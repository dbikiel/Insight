Released from a British prison, an American is hired as an electrician for a London bank but his criminal acquaintances show-up and force the reluctant Yank to join them as the inside-man in a well-planned bank heist.
Pinky is released from prison and has decided to go straight from now on, but accidentally getting himself a job as a maintenance man at a large bank, gives him a lot of undue attention from Ivan the Terrible, the local hoodlum. By using Pinky, Ivan hopes to rob the bank, and Pinky starts to liken to the idea of going back to his old ways.
