Two girls thrown together by their boyfriends' violence accidentally kill one of them.
One stormy Glasgow night Dorothy and Petula's lives are inextricably thrown together, bonded by a common flaw. Dorothy's on the run from her boyfriend and Petula should be doing the same. Evasion, blackmail, murder, betrayal, revenge and a suitcase loaded with a million quid... it's all there... and then some.
