A man, objecting to being filmed, comes closer and closer to the camera lens until his mouth is all we see. Then he opens wide and swallows camera and cinematographer. He steps back, chews, and grins.
Annoyed by the freelance cameraman's persistent attempts to film him, an irritated camera-shy man decides to take matters into his own hands. Steadily and without delay, the man moves closer and closer towards the camera until his colossal and out-of-proportion mouth devours both the unsuspecting photographer and his equipment whole. Undoubtedly, that should teach him a lesson.
Here is a most novel picture. A prominent actor with wonderful talent for facial contortion is standing some distance from the camera. As the film is set in motion, he walks toward the lens until his head grows into enormous proportions. He then stands so close to the camera that every wrinkle in his face, and in fact, the pores of his skin are plainly shown and greatly magnified. As he comes closer to the lens he opens his mouth wide, and is biting at the instrument all the while. He is then seen to swallow the camera, operator and all. He is next seen backing away from the instrument, smacking lips and rubbing his stomach in great glee. Very funny and a great hit.
