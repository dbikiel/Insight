A woman and a young girl in different cities are struggling to find their way in this world. Will their paths intersect and will that change their destinies?
Lena is 38 years old. Her life, it seems, is all mapped out: Moscow, a career, a "prestigious" boyfriend. But Lena understands that all this leads nowhere, that underneath the appearance she has lost something very important; thus, finally, she reconsiders her life--either now or never. Lena throws it all in and goes to St Petersburg, where she accepts the first available job: in the local social services. Kuka lives in Petersburg, completely on her own. The six-year-old girl is courageous, clever and very mature for her age. Lena and Kuka meet one day. Lena wants to help this strange little girl. But Kuka, having noticed Lena's compassion, instantly disappears for fear that Lena will turn her in to an orphanage.
