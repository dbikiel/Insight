Willard, a mild mannered insurance adjuster, teams up with a foul-mouthed fowl who takes Willard on a surreal quest to become less uptight - and possibly get laid in the process.
Willard, a mild-mannered insurance investigator, checks on the claim of an old woman, the owner of a tattoo parlor, who puts out a claim listing her as being dead. She tells him that her Ouija board gave her a message that she would be killed by a wizard. Willard tells her that she will not receive any money until she is dead, and, suddenly, she dies of a heart attack. Her will states that her killer would receive possession of her duck. The Dirty Duck takes Willard on a quest to experience in life to the fullest. First, they are both thrown in jail. Then, the two arrive at a house of ill repute in order to get Willard laid.
