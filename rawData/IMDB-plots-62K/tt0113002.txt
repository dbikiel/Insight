British soldiers force a recently captured IRA terrorist to cooperate with them and then assign him to go undercover with a gang of terrorists and prevent them from killing the U.S. President. But the spy isn't in long before he realizes that the first plot is but a ruse for a more sinister scheme that could result in trouble between China and Great Britain.
Sean Dillon is now married and has retired. Or so he thinks. But Brigadier Ferguson has got word of a sinister plot. Members of the royal family are to be shot. Is the IRA involved? Or old guard Russian leaders? Or middle East fundamentalists? In any case the hit man is ice-cold John Engel, Sean's nemesis. The consequences are tragic. Is there a place for love in such a world? Sean, Engel, Hannah Berstein, all seem to give it a desperate try.
