Five I4 soldiers serve in the army as auxiliaries in a unit supporting commando troops during military training. Due to all the chores and the pack drills, the soldiers will be forced to face the stiff necked commandos. This conflict will take place in a frontier Aegean island and it will mess everybody's (locals' and "foreign" enemies') lives up.
