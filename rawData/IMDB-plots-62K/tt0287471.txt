Zaza is a 31-year old Israeli bachelor, handsome and intelligent, and his family wants to see him married. But tradition dictates that Zaza has to choose a young virgin. She must be beautiful and from a good family, preferably rich. Zaza's parents, Yasha and Lily drag Zaza to meet potential brides and their families. Zaza has no choice. He plays along with his family, advocates of the suffocating traditions of their Georgian Jewish heritage. But Zaza always manages to somehow get out of being engaged. What his parents don't know is that Zaza is already in love. Judith is sensuous, strong and intriguing. She's also a divorcée with a 6-year-old daughter. So Zaza has kept Judith a secret from his family. He will have to choose between respect of the strict confines of family and tradition, or the love of his life.
Zaza is 31, a graduate student in philosophy; Judith is 34, a divorcée with a young child. They're in love. The obstacle is his family, Georgian Jews who will not allow divorce under their roof even though the men all seem to have mistresses and affairs in their past. The women are indomitable. Zaza's parents arrange for him to meet eligible young women; we watch them pay a formal call on one. Meanwhile, they know about Judith and her daughter. When the confrontation does come, will Zaza have the force of will to stand up to his family? And, what will Judith do?
