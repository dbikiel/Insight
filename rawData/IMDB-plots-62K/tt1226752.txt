A single mother delivers a monstrous baby boy, somehow connected to a dark prophecy involving the Black Brotherhood, a book called the Necronomicon, and a demonic portal.
In Louisiana, the thirty-five year old single mother Lavina, delivers a baby boy - and a monster - in the evil Whateley House. Ten years later, Dr. Henry Armitage and his assistant, Professor Fay Morgan, discover that page 751 of every copy of the Necronomicon is missing and the Black Brotherhood has summoned the gate keeper Yog Sothoth to leave the portal opened to the demons and ancient gods. They invite the arrogant and skeptical Professor Walter Rice, who can translate the Necronomicon, to help them to find the book. Meanwhile, Lavina's son, Wilbur Whateley, ages very fast and seeks the missing page to open the portal.
