After an accident during a routine trip to Venus, a spaceship has only enough oxygen left for three people... out of five on board.
After an asteroid has collided with their spaceship, the five astronauts aboard suddenly have to decide who's to live and who's to die, since the crash has left their oxygen supply almost depleted. The initially cosy atmosphere soon turns grim and hostile, as a nerve-racking fight for survival ensues, no holds barred...
