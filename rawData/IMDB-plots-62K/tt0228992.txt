After fifteen years together, Francoise breaks with Jacques. She finds herself alone with her three children, her work as a nurse and her pretty house. Little prepared for this situation, which she did not choose, she began to go out at night, to frequent new places, open to chance meetings. She neglects her mother's duties a little, doing and saying things unthinkable until now for her. Francoise discovers that there may be an alternative to what she thought was the only way to live and be happy.
