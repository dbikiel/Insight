An authoress writes a steaming sex-novel and proceeds to live out her heroine's adventures.
Goody-goody girl journalist Kelly Olsson (Ann-Margret Olsson) poses as a "swinger" to impress the horny stud editor of "Girl-lure" men's magazine (Tony Franciosa) to get him to publish her steaming sex story instead of her posing as his next nude centerfold. She spends the rest of the movie convincing the Girl-lure staff she is the girl in the story she has written about.
