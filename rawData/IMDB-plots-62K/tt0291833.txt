A gruesome homage to the cult Amicus anthology Asylum, Cradle of Fear unfolds four screamplays all linked by the unspeakable need of an incarcerated child killer to wreak vengeance on those responsible for his imprisonment. Helped by deranged angel Dani Filth, who leaves a trail of charnel house death in his crimson wake, the cannibal convict forces two Goth vamps to endure a one night stand from hell, two tough female robbers to see through each other, an obscenely rich coke-head to chop up more than a few lines and an internet surfer to descend into madness when he uncovers the ultimate web depravity.
In London, Detective Pete Neilson is investigating several bloody and gruesome murders with all the victims connected to the trial of the serial killer Kemper that is interned in the Fenham Asylum. Melissa has one night stand with a sick man she met in a Gothic club and while going to the house her friend Natalie on the next morning, she has the sensation that she is surrounded by demons. Sooner she finds that she carries an offspring of the man. Emma and Sophie go to the house of an old man to steal his money, but their robbery becomes violent when the dweller wakes up. Nick has a great complex with his beloved girlfriend Nikki because his leg was amputated in an accident. He becomes deranged, gets a leg and forces his doctor to implant it, with tragic results. Richard Neilson, the son of Detective Neilson, works in an Internet company and becomes obsessed with snuff movies in a website, where the user can select the means of killing the victim, losing his job. When the site vanishes, Richard seeks information finding the truth about the movies.
Revenge is wreaked upon several people who got something to do with an old satanist child-killer who has been closed in an Asylum for mentally ill and dangerous individuals. The avenger is the satanist's son, played by Dani Filth. The satanist is hunted by an inspector who is obsessed with killing the old man.
