Assigned to recover sensitive stolen data, a gruff FBI agent goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher, but the school's liberal, politically correct environment is more than he bargained for.
Hot on the trail of the Eastern-European criminal kingpin, Zogu, unexpectedly, the old-school F.B.I. Agent, Reed, finds himself at a well-organised elementary school. Knowing that Zogu is after a tiny flash drive containing highly sensitive information, Reed has to pose as a substitute kindergarten teacher to stand a chance of retrieving the precious item that is hidden somewhere in the classroom of a mysteriously deceased instructor. Now, like a fish out of water, Reed needs to take control of the class without blowing his cover; however, this is easier said than done. Can tough officer Reed gain the classroom's confidence before it's too late?
