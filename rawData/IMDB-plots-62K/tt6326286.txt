Maigret: Night at the Crossroads tells a complex tale of murder, deceit and greed set in an isolated country community.
Maigret has been interrogating a mysterious Dane, Carl Andersen, for hours without a confession. Why was the body of a diamond merchant found in his car at his isolated mansion? He's either innocent or a very good liar. What does his beautiful but vulnerable sister know? And what compels everyone at the Three Widows Crossroads to be so secretive? Maigret sets out to find his killer which ultimately leads to a thrilling climax.
Jeweller Isaac Goldberg leaves Antwerp with a cache of stolen diamonds but his body is found in the French village of Arpajon in a car belonging to aloof Dane Carl Anderson. Other villagers dislike him, telling Maigret he keeps his sister Else locked in her room and, whilst protesting his innocence, Carl attempts suicide when Maigret discovers that there are no records of his existence. Nonetheless Maigret releases him in the hopes that he will lead him to the missing diamonds and the actual murderer. The death of another suspect causes Maigret to believe the killer is one of the other villagers working in collusion with a member of the police force.
