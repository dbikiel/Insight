A weekend getaway for four couples takes a sharp turn when one of the couples discovers the entire trip was orchestrated to host an intervention on their marriage.
A young couple, Peter and Ruby, are married with three children. On a weekend trip a tight-knit group of friends confront them about their constant bickering and propose they divorce. Reacting in anger, the couple clearly realize the truth in what their friends are trying to say; nonetheless, they remember their old feelings for each other and decide instead to strive to improve their relationship. Later, the intervention is turned around on Annie (Lynskey) and her alcohol problem, while she begins to realize that her conspired marriage intervention for Ruby and Peter may have been based on her suppressed doubts about her own impending wedding.
