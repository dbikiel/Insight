Two thugs with no talent intend to follow in the footsteps of Dioni and plan a bank robbery. They end up becoming part of a massive media circus instead.
2012. Sevilla, Andalusia (south to Spain). El Culebra and El Cabesa are two longtime friends in eternal tracksuits without success and luck in life. Close to their 30s and living as blue-collar and six-penny pickpockets, they decide for committing their biggest sting: to assault a bank and escape to Brasil with the money, imitating the same events starred in 1989 by the famous Spanish ex security guard and later thief Dionisio Rodríguez Martín 'El Dioni'. Therefore, the theoretically easy robbery complicates in the moment to do it after the apparition in the bank of Fermín, a businessman and CEO in his 50s full of explosives who threatens with immolate himself, and that he claims the arrival of TV cameras to attract attention about his delicate economic situation. Out of the bank, the cops surrounds it to prevent any escape, causing that the only one solution for El Culebra and El Cabesa be to make stronger inside the bank, turning an easy assault in a complete kidnapping including hostages and explosives. From this moment ahead, the cops will try end the situation at any cost, but none of them count with the presence of a TV news female reporter between the hostages. Secretly she gets to make a live connection to the public eye to reveal all happens in the bank, turning unwittingly the kidnapping in a circus for the media, and El Culebra and El Cabesa in improvised heroes and Fermín's defenders. It causes that the hostages be divided between to escape for back to their homes and stand in the bank until Fermín's situation be repaired. According time goes by, and despite all efforts by the cops to make a deal to end the kidnapping, the tension inside and outside the bank get high, causing that the robbery finally escape to any control.
