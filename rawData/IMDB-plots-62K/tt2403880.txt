Three lonely next-door neighbours alienate themselves in various ways. Jacek seeks contacts online, his brother Tomek has a brain injury. Magda spends time alone in her apartment. What if they become friends?
This is the story of three characters: Tomek and Jacek are brothers, and Magda is their neighbour. Each of them is in their own way lonely and alienated. Magda, who likes sitting in her wardrobe, isolates herself from the outside world and even attempts suicide. Tomek's alienation is caused by his neurological disease, and Jacek contacts the world mainly via the Internet. Their lives change unexpectedly when Jacek has a business meeting and asks Magda to take care of his autistic brother.
