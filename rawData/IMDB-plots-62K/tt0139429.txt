When Ben is released from prison, undercover police agent Melody picks him up at the gate. Kahnitz, her sinister and ambitious boss, wants to see Ben convicted of another crime as soon as possible. Since Ben seems to show only mild interest both in Melody and in safe-busting she has to come up with a plan. Alas, the talkative cop has developed quite a liking for the taciturn gangster.
