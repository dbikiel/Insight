Not only is this written by the same screen writer who wrote the earlier "Rock Around the Clock", it uses the same exact lines.
The plot is virtually identical to the plot of the earlier film "Rock Around the Clock." A struggling manager visits a hayseed town and discovers a new dance craze, and hopes to turn it into a overnight nationwide sensation. Features performances by Chubby Checker and Dion.
