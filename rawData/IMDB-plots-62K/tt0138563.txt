A documentary on the life of Kurt Cobain and his relationship with Courtney Love.
After rocker Kurt Cobain's death, ruled a suicide, a film crew arrives in Seattle to make a documentary. Director Nick Broomfield talks to lots of people: Cobain's aunt who provides home movies and recordings, the estranged father of Cobain's widow Courtney Love, an L.A. private investigator who worked for Love, a nanny for Kurt and Courtney's child, friends and lovers of both, and others. Although Love won't talk to him and his inquiries lose him financial backing, he comes to believe the coroner's verdict. Portraits emerge: a shy, slight Kurt, weary of touring, embarrassed by fame, hooked on heroin; an out-going Courtney, dramatic, controlling, moving from groupie to star.
A first approach to the mysteries that surrounds the suicide of singer and composer Kurt Cobain in 1994, when he was only 27-years-old. Nick Broomfield, documentary maker from the BBC, makes a tour by the most representative places that witness the rise of the young musician, giving form to a small biopic as well, since his first years in the school in his native Seattle, showing interesting material such as rare recordings of his voice when he was 2-years-old, and the first concerts with his band, Nirvana, at small sceneries. Broomfield interviews important people in Kurt's life, such as his best friend, moving step by step to the bottom line, facing up to Courtney Love's father, who wrote a book who features the theory that Kurt was in fact murdered.
