A group of 5 Otago University students start squatting in an old, abandoned house.

This is the start of a nightmarish spiral through crime and the possiblities of murder.
Dunedin, New Zealand: it's not famous for its nice weather, stunning architecture, cosmopolitan lifestyle etc etc. But it is famous, for its scarfies - the students who call Dunedin home for 3-10 years while attending the city's fine university, and so called because of the once ubiquitous blue-and-gold scarves worn on campus to ward off the harsh southern winter. Scarfies centres around a group of five of students who get together after moving into a flat that is seemingly abandoned, but still has the power on, making for free if filthy accomodation. From here on in the film takes on a different tone as the plot kicks in with the discovery of a massive quantity of something very valuable growing in the basement, leading to at first euphoria, then paranoia and arguments amongst the flatmates over who owns the stuff and when they'll be coming to collect it. Scarfies starts out as a light comedy that gradually changes gears throughout to black comedy and finally to a sort of thriller by the end as the youngsters get further and further in over their heads.
