The life of the virgin and martyr Santa Maria Goretti.
Long length with Maria Goretti's touching history and of Alessandro Serenelli. Two young that live an intense friendship which could have transformed her in a love history. Alessandro, however, in an impulse of violent passion, he transforms it in a tragedy. The film, of that tender and simple youth, wants to show that it is possible to conserve the Christian values, even at the expense of the sacrifice of the own life, testifying in the pardon, the force of the love without measure.
