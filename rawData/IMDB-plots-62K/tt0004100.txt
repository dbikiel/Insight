Charlie and his partner are to deliver a piano to 666 Prospect St. and repossess one from 999 Prospect St. They confuse the addresses. The difficulties of delivering the piano by mule cart, and most of the specific gags, appeared later in Laurel and Hardy's "The Music Box".
Tom is out of work. Longing for a draught of beer he presents himself at a piano establishment and gets taken on as a piano mover. He then gives an exhibition of his tremendous strength, and he and another muscular employee are told to deliver a piano at the home of Mr. Rich and take one away from the house of Mr. Poor. Of course they get the houses twisted, and after several excruciatingly funny scenes, both piano movers land in the river with the piano on top of them.
