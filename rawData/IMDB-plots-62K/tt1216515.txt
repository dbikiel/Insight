Tinker Bell must team up with a rival fairy to keep their existence a secret from humans.
Tinker Bell accidentally gets stuck inside a human house and befriends a little girl who believes in fairies. Tinker Bell's fairy friends go to rescue her and they believe she was captured by the little girl, until they make it to the house and Tinker Bell shows them she is a friend. Tinker Bell helps the little girl and her father fix their relationship.
An otherwise lovely and safe getaway in the lush English countryside soon ends up in a disaster, when an inadvertent mistake traps the helpless Tinker Bell in the small fairy house of the pixie-loving young human named Lizzy Griffiths. However, as both girls form a beautiful friendship, Tink's fairy companions--Iridessa, Silvermist, Rosetta, and Fawn--boldly set out on a mission outside Pixie Hollow to rescue their beloved tinker who think has been kidnapped. Will Lizzy's sceptical dad believe in fairies?
