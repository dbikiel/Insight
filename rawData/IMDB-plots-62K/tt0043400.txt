After invading a cheese factory, mice Hubie and Bertie have finally had their fill of cheese and figure there's nothing more left to live for. They plan to end it all by surrendering to Claude Cat, who becomes decidedly suspicious.
Two mice named Hubie and Bertie gorge themselves on cheese. Hubie deduces that having had their fill of 2000 lifetimes worth of cheese, there's no reason to go on living.After leaving a note, the two go into a residential home, and try to get the cat there to eat them. When the cat refuses, they try everything from pleading to bullying, which does nothing but frighten the cat.After being driven to the end of his rope, the cat leaves a note, and heads out to end his life. Finding a dog, he provokes it and pleads to be 'massacred.' The dog finds this perplexing that a cat would so willingly want to die.As they talk, the dog sees the two mice accost the cat, and try to get him to eat them, with the cat refusing. The dog then asks the cat if he likes to eat mice, and is met with a 'no.' When the dog asks the mice if they like cheese, they panic and demand never to hear that word again.Perplexed, the dog then tries to make sense of it all...but in the end, finds that the entire thing does not make sense at all! As he sees a truck driving by on it's way to an insane asylum, he rushes after it, wishing to be committed. The cat chases the dog, still wanting to be 'massacred,' and the mice follow the cat, still wishing to be put out of their misery.
