An innocent teenager, studying to be a vet, develops a craving for human flesh.
Justine is a first-year veterinary student. Her elder sister is studying the same course at the university. Justine was raised a strict vegetarian but, as part of the hazing rituals, is forced to eat meat. Initially this has adverse effects but she soon develops a craving for meat.
Raised as a rigorous vegetarian, doe-eyed freshman, Justine, is sent off to the reputable Saint-Exup√©ry Veterinary school where the black sheep of the family, her big sister Alexia, is already studying. There, as Justine leaves the familial shelter, she will abruptly move into a mad new world of school traditions and vicious initiation tests, and before long, she will be forced to chew over her devout herbivorous beliefs. Descending deep into her uncharted animalistic tendencies, an unprecedented and equally unquenched craving for raw meat will replace repulsion, transforming Justine into something she would have never expected.
