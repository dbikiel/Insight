The Miss Gay AmericaÂ® Pageant has more talent and drama than the Miss America, Miss USA and Miss Universe Pageants combined. To be crowned Miss Gay America is being honored as the most beautiful and fiercely talented female impersonator in the country. The Pageant is entering into its 34th year of competition, celebrating the creativity and passion behind the art form. Miss Gay America is all about the art of illusion, so the contestants are not allowed to have had any cosmetically altering surgeries below the neck and must be female-hormone free.The movie offers a human face to this little know world of illusion and introduces and follows the lives of five everyday men and their families as they strive for one extraordinary goal. Not only will PAGEANT expose the glamour and fantastic talents of each individual in this world, but also introduce the heart and soul of the movie, which are the men behind it all. Life is all about hoping for and achieving your dreams. PAGEANT is a revealing and touching look at the extraordinary lengths these gentlemen will to go to be crowned Miss Gay America.Fifty contestants from across the United States are as unique and varied as the cities they come from.
