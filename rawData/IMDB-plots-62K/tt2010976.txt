Lourdes is a young woman that works at night cleaning a restaurant. All the money she made is for her son that lives in her hometown with her mother. We know very little about Lourdes son, only that he is sick and Lourdes is working every night and sending money to help her son and find a cure for his illness. Suddenly, Lourdes starts seeing visions in the restaurant where she works, in her little apartment. These visions, her evil co-workers and her son apart from her, all this stresses Lourdes out and she begins asking herself "who wants to hurt her"? Or if all of whats happening is really happening or not.
Immigrant mother (Marta Milans, Killer Women, Mala Hierba) works as a cleaning woman at an old New York City restaurant in order to make enough money to pay for her sick son's operation. With no friends or family, she lives a lonely, desperate existence, saving every penny and sending it home for her son. As his condition worsens malevolent forces living within the walls of the restaurant begin to torment her. She struggles to escape, and return to her son before the evil within the dark walls drives her completely mad.
