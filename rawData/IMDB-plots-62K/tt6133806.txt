The time change and a case of mistaken identity result in a wonderful blind date for Trish and Parker, but is it enough to keep them together?
Dessert and pastry baker Trish Harper is quietly ambitious and wary of her older sister Chloe setting her up on blind dates until she meets easygoing paramedic Parker by mistake: he's sitting where her actual blind date, attorney Adam, was supposed to be, unaware at first that she missed the date due to missing Daylight Savings Time. Trish and Parker enjoy an unexpected date to remember but she agrees to meet Adam at last. While she finds little chemistry with the self-possessed Adam, and can't make Chloe understand that, she finds plenty more with Parker, whose wit, intelligence, and lack of ego charm her even as his reserve about his life puzzles her until she accidentally discovers and misinterprets Parker's most painful secret.
