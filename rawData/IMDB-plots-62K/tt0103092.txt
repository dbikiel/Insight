"Papa", one of the chiefs of a tribe in the highlands, is taxi driver of a "Tinpis", a collective bush-taxi. Saved from an accident by Naaki, a young man from the city, he offers him his daughter in thanks. Johanna and Naaki, however, refuse that their happiness be decided by her father, even though they have already fallen in love.
