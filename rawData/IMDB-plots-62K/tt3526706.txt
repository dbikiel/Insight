A fishing trip in the Aegean Sea among a sextet of friends becomes the perfect setting for a relentless contest of male dominance. Everything can spark a fierce competition; but, only one can wear the precious chevalier. Who will it be?
In the middle of the Aegean Sea, six men on a fishing trip on a luxury yacht decide to play a game. During this game, things will be compared. Things will be measured. Songs will be butchered, and blood will be tested. Friends will become rivals and rivals will become hungry. But at the end of the journey, when the game is over, the man who wins will be the best man. And he will wear on his smallest finger the victory ring: the Chevalier.
Millions of years of evolutionary process lead to a safe conclusion: in nature, only the fittest survive. With this in mind--against the backdrop of the eternal Aegean Sea--a seemingly innocent fishing trip among a sextet of friends aboard a decadently luxurious yacht becomes the perfect setting for a no-holds-barred contest of male dominance. Now, within the confines of the streamlined boat, just about everything can spark a fierce competition to ascertain the "best in general", as the polite and comme-il-faut men destroy their already frail allegiances one by one. Undoubtedly, man needs to be the best hunter; the best fighter, and above all, the best lover. Whose pinkie will the precious chevalier adorn at the end of the trial?
