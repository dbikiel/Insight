Sisters Alex and Madison are whisked away to the Bahamas for winter break but soon find themselves crossing paths with a man smuggling stolen artifacts.
CEO Harrison Stewart treats his family to a holiday on the Bahamas in a Mayan theme luxury resort, with his devoted workaholic executive Ziggy Grayson and his brilliant but shy son Griffen, who is secretly smitten with Madison Stewart. Hearing she has a crush on simpleton beach hunk Chad, Griffen sweetly accepts to be his Cyrano, which actually ends up proving their incompatibility. Meanwhile her twin sister Madison enjoys an affair with sea-life keeper Jordan Landers, but spoiled silver spoon Brianna wants him too and sabotages them. When Jordan is blamed for allegedly fencing stolen antiquities, Griffen and the twins dodge their meanwhile suspicious parents to find and expose the real culprit.
Madison &amp; Alex go to the Bahamas for a holiday. What they thought would be a normal family holiday, turns out to be very different than expected.
