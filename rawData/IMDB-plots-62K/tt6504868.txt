SADIE is the story of a girl who will stop at nothing to preserve her father's place on the home front. Sadie (Sophia Mitri Schloss) is the daughter of a soldier and models herself after his military example. When her mom (Melanie Lynskey) begins dating a new man (John Gallagher, Jr.), Sadie vows to drive him out by whatever means necessary. He is the enemy, and if she's learned anything from the world she inhabits, it's that the enemy deserves no mercy. The film also stars Tony Hale, Danielle Brooks, Tee Dennard and Keith L. Williams.
