Barbie stars in her first holiday movie in this heart-warming adaptation of the classic Dickens story filled with cherished Christmas carols, fabulous fashions and lots of laughs!
Intent on spending Christmas Eve at home rather than going to the hospital's annual charity ball, Barbie's little sister, Kelly, dreams of eating cookies and drinking cocoa in front of her fireplace. Much like Charles Dickens' timeless festive tale depicted in Scrooge (1951), to convince her, Barbie recounts the story of the famous Victorian singer, Eden Starling, who demands that her crew cancel their Christmas plans, to rehearse her upcoming show. Will the night-time visitations by the Spirits of Christmases Past, Present, and Future help Eden change her mind?
