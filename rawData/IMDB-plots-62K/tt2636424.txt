Shot over two years, across the UK, following the political icon Tony Benn, as he crisscrossed the country continuing a long tradition of radical socialism.
Tony Benn (87), the longest serving Labour MP in history, is also, arguably, the most popular UK politician of all time. Across the globe and in particular over the last five years his brand of socialism has struck a cord with people of all ages and social backgrounds. For the first time ever through intimate, quasi confessional interviews and his personal, photographic and film archive 'Will And Testament' reveals a very human face behind the political mask. In this feature length film, Tony Benn also criss-crosses the UK bearing witness to major social and political upheavals and events. He hopes 'Will And Testament' will prove to be the defining documentary of the most globally and politically aware generation in a lifetime. This documentary is an exclusive and deeply personal look at the life of a national treasure, a frank, candid and sometimes painful exploration of the great themes of life that have affected him and affect us all, love, loss, hopes, dreams, fears and death. Never before has a person of his calibre and reputation spoken to camera in such a direct way.
'Will and Testament' is a 90mins feature doc. Shot over two years, across the United Kingdom, it has been an adventure following the political icon that was Tony Benn, as he criss crossed the country continuing a long tradition of radical socialism. For the first time his personal and political archive is combined with the most frank and candid interviews he ever gave set against a surrealist backdrop of his life created at Ealing Studios. 'Will and Testament' is a unique portrait a man some hated, many loved but who all of us respected.
