A New York street hustler specializing in name-brand knock-offs finds his highly profitable game suddenly complicated when his ex-girlfriend shows up toting the son he never knew he had.
Prince of Broadway is the story of Lucky and Levon, two men whose
lives converge in the underbelly of New York's wholesale fashion
district. Lucky, an illegal immigrant from Ghana, makes ends meet by
soliciting shoppers on the street with knock-off brand merchandise.
Levon, a Armenian-Lebanese immigrant, operates an illegal storefront
with a concealed back room where counterfeit goods are showcased to
interested shoppers. Lucky's world is suddenly turned upside down
when a child is thrust into his life by a woman who insists the
toddler is his son. While Lucky copes with his new domestic dilemma,
Levon struggles to save a marriage that is falling apart.
