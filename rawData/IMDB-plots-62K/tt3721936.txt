Hopelessly, Star, a troubled Texan,18-year-old teenager, decides to run away from her dysfunctional family, and lured by the charms of Jake, a cocky and rebellious lead salesman of a wandering door-to-door magazine subscription selling team, will leave for Kansas City on a road adventure throughout the American Midwest. Gradually, Star, the American Honey from the South, among a motley crew of teenage misfits, will finally find a place where she can really fit in, and before long, she will immerse herself deep into a world of recklessness, fearless self-exploration, experimentation and youthful love. Ultimately, Star swept up, while at the same time baffled by the confident Jake, will take the risk of falling in love and get hurt, even if this means she could drift and get lost on the way.
