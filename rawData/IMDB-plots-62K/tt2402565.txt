Santilli is looking for a lucky break to change his life. In South Italy there's a town whose entire population is over the age of eighty. Santilli opens a funeral agency. With the earnings from the certain funerals he'll be able to solve his problems. Santilli patches together a credible funeral agency and waits for the old-timers to die. Days glide by and not a single one of them has the decency to croak. Santilli is oppressed and discouraged. During the butt-nipping cold of winter, he catches pneumonia. But now the old-timers, are the ones who tend to the undertaker. The relationship based on the certainty of Death becomes one based on the hope of Life.
