Secret agent Matt Helm must battle foreign spies and a rogue nation's exiled ruler in order to recover a hijacked U.S. government experimental flying saucer.
Without a doubt, there's a mole in the secret Intelligence and Counter Espionage agency. Right after the successful launch of the first state-of-the-art USAF flying saucer, the powerful tractor beam of a nefarious criminal organisation forces the experimental vessel to crash-land in the lush Central-American jungles. As a result, having no recollection of the mysterious incident, the amnesiac test pilot, Sheila Sommers, will have to join forces with the spy extraordinaire and suave photographer, Matt Helm, and travel to sun-kissed Acapulco to shed light on this thorny case. Nevertheless, their luxurious Mexican resort is rife with deadly traps and crafty double-agents, bent on stopping the prying intruders. Will Matt and Sheila unearth the dangerous conspiracy? Can they retrieve the top-secret spacecraft?
A government space saucer is hijacked mid-flight by a powerful laser beam. ICE sends agent Matt Helm to Acapulco with and the female pilot, Sheila Sommars, to recover the saucer, under the guise of Matt taking fashion photographs of beautiful models. Matt is temporarily side-tracked, falling prey to the seductive charms of enemy agent Franceca Madeiros.
A flying saucer built by the U.S. government is launched into space on a top secret test flight. Sheila Sommars is the pilot chosen and all goes well until she is found a few months later in a state of shock. Agent Matt Helm is then assigned to find the saucer, with Sheila posing as his wife. When he gets to Mexico, he must not only deal with the exiled ruler, Ortega and his henchman Quintana, but with enemy agent Fracesca Madeiros and an Arab agent/assassin named Nassim.
