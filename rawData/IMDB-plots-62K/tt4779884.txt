On New Year's Eve, married couple and theatre artists Steven and Vanessa host an annual get-together at their parents' cabin for their oldest friends, struggling actress Sadie and her new surfer/rock star boyfriend Jude, Bryce, a repressed accountant, and Jodie, a world-weary photojournalist. When Jodie and Bryce drop a relationship bombshell over dinner, they set off a chain reaction of truth-telling that promises to destroy the carefully-crafted reality of everyone present. How long is too long to wait for your dream? Can art change the world? Are we all doomed? A film about old friends and artistic passion, Auld Lang Syne is a meditation on the creative class, global warming, and the power of damn fine pie.
