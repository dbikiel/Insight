This is the tale of industrial strife at WC Boggs' Lavatory factory. Vic Spanner is the union representative who calls a strike at the drop of a hat; eventually everyone has to get fed up with him. This is also the ideal opportunity for lots of lavatorial jokes...
They all go on a outing to Brighton and discover the hotel kitchen staff are also on strike so they all go on the pier and get hammered, WC Boggs finds himself in miss witherings bed naked and cant remember a thing and his son Mr Lewis Boggs marries Sid Plummer's daughter Myrtle Plummer.
