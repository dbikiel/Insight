In a world of decay even the most horrific deeds seem normal. Life account of the most dreaded German serial killer of the 1930s.
Dreaded serial killer Peter Kurten voluntarily turns himself over to the authorities. A young lawyer, eager to prove Kurten's mental derangement, agrees to defend a man who terrorized Germany between 1929 and 1931. In studying the case and meeting with the intelligent, cold-blooded manipulator, the young idealist's values become warped.
Jane (age 11) is dancing with her mum Angela and little brother Peter whilst waiting for her dad David to arrive with a very important guest for lunch. A feast Angela has gone to a lot of trouble to prepare. Hours later, with the guests late, the kids starving and Angela manically diverting their attention from hunger, Jane seizes her chance, and eats from the waiting feast, only to be caught red handed by her brother, who complains. Enraged, Angela chases Jane and the feast lands in a big mess on the floor just as the guests arrive. Rescued by her dad, Jane is pressurized by him to keep the family secret on the way to hospital. But the nurses there have other ideas and separate father and daughter. They nearly convince Jane to tell, however, wanting a normal family, Jane keeps the secret and loses a part of herself instead.
