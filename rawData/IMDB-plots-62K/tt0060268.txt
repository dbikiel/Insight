In search of help, two wounded gangsters on the run find refuge in the secluded castle of a feeble man and his wife; however, under the point of a gun, nothing is what it seems.
A wounded criminal and his dying partner take refuge at a beachfront castle. The owners of the castle, a meek Englishman and his willful French wife, are initially the unwilling hosts to the criminals. Quickly, however, the relationships between the criminal, the wife, and the Englishman begin to shift in humorous and bizarre fashion.
The wounded criminal Richard "Dicky" and his dying partner Albie seek for shelter in an old seaside castle full of chickens and owned by the eccentric and coward American George and his slut French wife Teresa. While waiting for the rescue of his boss, Albie dies and Dicky develops a strange relationship with the odd couple.
With the taste of failure in his mouth; on the run from the police, and with a dying accomplice in his hands, the wounded brute gangster, Dickie, will eventually discover the perfect hideout: a magnificent and seemingly deserted castle by the sea, now home of the feeble ex-factory owner, George, and his frivolous French wife, Teresa. Home-invaded and forced to go along with Dickie's orders, the unlikely fellowship will wait for the next morning to get help; instead, an unexpected visit from the obnoxious Fairweathers and their friends will be, indeed, the last straw. In the end, penniless, manipulated, and on the verge of a glorious emotional breakdown, the always coward George must--for once in his life--find the courage to defend his fortress, and his remaining dignity. But, has he the strength to do it?
