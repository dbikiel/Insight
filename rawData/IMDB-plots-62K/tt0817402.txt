Years ago, they pulled a disastrous childhood prank on the neighborhood ice cream delivery man that got him killed, but now as they've become adults with families of their own, the last thing anyone expected was for that man to come back in the form of a vengeful, bloodthirsty spirit.
Based on the short story "I Scream, You Scream, We all Scream, for Ice Cream" by John Farris. Telling of a group of young kids who tormented and accidentally killed a local Ice Cream delivery man whose spirit has risen to invoke his revenge on the gang, now all grown up, and their families.
