The story of two men, who met as apprentices in the Peking Opera, and stayed friends for over 50 years.
"Farewell, My Concubine" is a movie with two parallel, intertwined stories. It is the story of two performers in the Beijing Opera, stage brothers, and the woman who comes between them. At the same time, it attempts to do no less than squeeze the entire political history of China in the twentieth century into a three-hour time-frame.
China, 1924. Prostitute Yanhong sees no other alternative than leaving her shy son Douzi behind at a training school for Chinese opera. Shitou, an older boy, takes pity on Douzi and he needs it because master Guan rules his school with an iron fist. The boys are beaten, tortured for forgetting their lines, so put to the test mentally that suicide sometimes is the only option left. Douzi and Shitou become friends and are talented, destined to be great actors, they impress audiences by performing together. Douzi however wants more from the friendship, but Shitou doesn't answer his advances. The situation becomes worse when the courtesan Juxian manipulates Shitou in rescuing her from the brothel House of Blossoms and marrying her. Through the years, with the political situation in China ever changing and not always for the good, Shitou and Douzi remain close, but will it ever be like old times?
