In his first stand-up special, Comedian Bill Burr takes aim at the stuff that drives us crazy, political correctness gone haywire, and girlfriends; or as he calls them, "relentless psycho robots."
One of America's fastest-rising comedians, Bill Burr wields his razor-sharp wit with rare skill. You've seen him on Chappelle's Show, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Late Night with David Letterman and HBO's One Night Stand. In this brand-new stand-up performance, Bill takes aim at the stuff that drives us crazy, political correctness gone haywire, and girlfriends, or as he calls them, "relentless psycho robots." A keenly observant social commentator, Bill Burr is also one of the funniest voices in comedy today.
