Two young brothers are forced to track down their absent father, having recently returned from service in Afghanistan, after he disappears during a reindeer hunt in the mountains.
The feature film TILBAKE begins as Einar (Ingar Helge Gimle) returns to his family in Norway after serving as an officer in Afghanistan for nearly a year. Absent a clear father figure, the eldest brother Oscar (Åsmund Høeg) has assumed responsibility for little brother Fredrik (Fredrik Grøndahl) and the home, as their mother Anna (Lia Boysen) is bed-ridden most of the time. The homecoming does not turn out as expected, as the father seems distant upon seeing his family again. He goes out hunting the morning after and doesnt return as promised that evening. After spending the entire night waiting, the boys decide to walk up the mountain, hoping to find their father. The search itself becomes a test of manhood and the brothers relationship one from which they will return forever changed.
