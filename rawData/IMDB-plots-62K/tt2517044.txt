A question many wrestle with at some point along their lifes journey. Viewers will walk out of the theatre inspired by THE SONG and encouraged to pursue a life of significance yet challenged with the question, From where does true significance come?The Song is a modern day adaption of Song of Solomon. Executive Producer, Kyle Idleman (author of Not a Fan) does not apologize for the movie being referenced as the sexiest Christian movie released to date. I believe the greatest way to impact culture is for the church to come out from under its hidden covers when it comes to issues like sex, love and marriage. As long as the church community remains silent on these issues popular culture will continue to shape how we think about them.I highly recommend this movie as well as its soundtrack. I plan to see it again with my family and friends this weekend. THE SONG is truly at the top of my list of best romantic movies of the year as well as best faith-based romantic movie released to date. Make plans to be in the theatre opening weekend you wont be disappointed. The Song is a movie worth your dollars and one that will leave you moved and inspired by the power of true love.
