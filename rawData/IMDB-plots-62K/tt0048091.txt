In Arizona, during the 1950s, privileged white girl Amanda Lawrence marries half-Apache mining engineer Jonathan Dartland who dreams of finding gold in an old abandoned Apache mine.
Amanda Dartland accompanies her half-Apache husband Jonathan to a mining community where he will supervise the excavation of an almost mythical Apache treasure. His jealous rages and macho attitude cause her much misery, while the excavation project is threatened by prejudice and fear. Amanda tries to bridge the cultural gap, and Jonathan must do the same, or he will lose her. Mesmerizing brief performance by Celia Lovsky as Princess Saba.
