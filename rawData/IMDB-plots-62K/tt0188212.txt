Neo-nazi takes over a school, turns it into training camp with attempt to coup d'etat. Sukeban Deka should stop him, but it seems to impossible if she's alone.
18 year old Yoko Godai (Yoko Minamino) is newly retired from her stint as a yo-yo brandishing special agent, codename Saki Asamiya (aka Sukeban Deka), and is now studying for college entrance exams. This newfound peace comes to a screeching halt when she encounters a young man trying to take down a facist group aiming to overthrow the government by training youth in a militarized private school. Yoko again takes upon the mantle of Sukeban Deka, recruiting both old and new friends for one last mission.
