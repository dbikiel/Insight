After a botched robbery attempt five years ago, Ricky went to jail for his brother Rafael and his buddy Latif. Now that he is back out of jail, Latif wants to show his gratitude: he says he has a surefire scheme to get rich quickly, and Ricky could use the money to set up his new life. Ricky hesitates at first but then agrees. Complications arise as soon as some preparations start. Things kept going out in awry, especially as a form of hardup policewoman Diana.
