Different factions in WWII-era Holland race to find a stash of Nazi gold.
In a daring attempt to end the war by Christmas, Winston Churchill and the British High Command hatch an extraordinary plan - Operation Market Garden. 35,000 British troops are dropped behind enemy lines in German occupied Holland. In the midst of the largest airborne invasion in history, one small unit of men, codename "Matchbox" has its own agenda. When Matchbox are shot down short of their landing zone, the odds of their success seem hopeless. Seven very different British soldiers find themselves separated from the Allied invasion, on a collision course with three renegade German soldiers who also want to lay claim to the horde.
