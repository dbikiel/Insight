When Ah-Gou, a smalltime Hong Kong street rascal, visits a fortune teller and hears that soon he will face a life-changing choice, he surely can't imagine that his life reached a middle point without return. Will he go to Mainland China with his fellow gangsters to close a deal on a couple of stolen cars? Or will he instead chose to accompany his friend on a trip to kill a mafioso in Taiwan? We are presented with the outcomes of both choices, but is any of the choices really a good one won't be easy to tell... This underground action comedy not only draws inspirations from Krzysztof Kieslowski and Quentin Tarantino, but can also be seen as a highly evaluated political commentary on Hongkong's transition to the People's Republic of China in 1997. Avant-garde cinematography, trippy electronic music and a variety of characteristic figures makes it a fun and memorable experience.
