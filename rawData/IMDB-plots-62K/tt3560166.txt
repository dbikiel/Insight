As the survivor of a serial killer's attack tries to cope with the death of her friends- and the fact that she brutally killed her attacker, she fears the trauma has awakened a dark side of her psyche.
SURVIVAL KNIFE picks up where the typical Hollywood slasher film ends. Penny (Danielle Donahue) is the sole survivor of a vicious attack that killed five of her closest friends. To escape she was forced to brutally kill her would-be murderer. As she begins the slow process of recovering both physically and mentally, she struggles to deal with both the violence that happened to her, and the violence she committed herself.
