A former CIA operative turned political talk show host is hired by a disaffected corporate shareholder to expose her company's cover-up of an incident and deaths in an Ecuadorian village.
A large international water purification company has a major filtration system malfunction in Ecuador, South America resulting in a typhoid breakout in the town. Government security forces move in and shoot the villagers to prevent the information getting out and spoiling the next big deal the company is working on in South Africa. Morgan Swinton, the daughter in the family controlled business discovers what is happening and hires an ex-CIA agent, Jack Begosian, to go down and get the information on what is really happening. The company's security force, working with the brother, are overly aggressive and have secretive special handling resources to deal with the woman, her contract investigator and the witnesses from the village that survived to prevent anything impacting the pending closure of the next multi-million dollar deal. There are homicides, suicides, double crosses and lots of gratuitous violence before the truth gets told.
