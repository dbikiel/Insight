1947. Commander of UPA (or The Ukrainian Insurgent Army) Danylo Chervonyi gets into the terrible slaughter of Stalin's prison-camp Gulag, where he must go through hell and inhumane prison conditions, prosecution of criminal leaders, meanness, betrayal and despair. Danylo finds the strength to resist repression of the prison-camp commander and makes a desperate attempt to break free, raising the first rebel in the camp.
