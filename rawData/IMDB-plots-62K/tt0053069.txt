During the Napoleonic era, in Spain, a young postulant falls in love with a handsome British soldier who is recovering with others of his regiment after being wounded. Before leaving, he asks her to leave the convent and marry him. The postulant, devoted to the statue of the Virgin Mary, asks her for a heavenly sign and leaves when nothing happens. Then the statue of the Virgin ascends to its pedestal.
