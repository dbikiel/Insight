A young actress rehearsing for a play about human trafficking begins to relive terrifying scenes that may be dreams -- or an alternate reality.
Milena is a rookie actress who aspires to get the leading role in a theater play. But in order to get it she will have to accept some disturbing games proposed by the director that turn her body into an object of desire and possession. As she gets into the character she plays onstage, between rehearsal and rehearsal, they start to sink in trances that connect her to a sinister place where she is held in captivity and sexually exploited by a web of human trafficking. Milena travels from one reality to another without understanding which the true world she inhabits is, while the parallel universes superimpose each other more and more and their borders fade. With this new incursion into horror after his previous film, Still Life, Gabriel Grieco directs and co-writes with Sebasti√°n Rotsein a thrilling tour-de-force in which the topics of American gothic intermingle with elements much closer to home and more everyday, but equally horrifying.
