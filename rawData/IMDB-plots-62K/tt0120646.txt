The Deep End of The Ocean is a film about a family's reaction when Ben, the youngest son is kidnapped and then found ten years later, living in the same town.
Family father and entrepreneur Pat does his best to let life go on as best possible after his youngest son Ben is lost in a mall, presumed kidnapped. His wife Beth however remains obsessed with the case, antagonizing everyone and neglecting firstborn Vincent, who can't stand their fighting either. Vincent's plight worsens ten years later, when a recently moved-in widower's adopted son Sam is identified as Ben, and 'reunited' with a family he doesn't know at all. Yet Sam proves the key to saving Vincent from derailing.
