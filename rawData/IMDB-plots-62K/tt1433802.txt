Two estranged brothers, traveling in a classically restored Morgan convertible, are obliged to deliver their father's ashes to his hometown in Calabria. Genziano (co-writer Marco Bonini) and Mirko (co-writer/director Edoardo Leo) haven't spoken for 18 years, ever since a mysterious accident involving their mother. After the incident, Genziano immigrates to England, where he is a successful businessman, while Mirko stays in Italy working in their father's auto shop. As the brothers travel across Italy, sometimes accompanied by the beautiful and mysterious hitchhiker Cate, they learn to communicate again and fight about various family secrets. Meanwhile, in Rome, Mirko's wife develops a tender relationship with the grandfather who came from London with Genziano. A touching and funny work about sibling relations, "Eighteen Years Later" showcases the collaborative teamwork of Leo and Bonini, the picturesque Calabrian countryside, and a diverse and bouncy soundtrack.
