With a ticking bomb locked to his neck, a young freerunner races against the clock and all types of baddies to get from one end of the city to the other to save himself and his girlfriend.
Ryan and other traceurs (parkour practitioners) frequently submit themselves to races through the city organized by Reese, a promoter who makes an Internet gambling fortune off of them while giving them a minuscule amount (if that) in return. With the last race of the season coming up, Ryan decides it's time to secretly break Reese's rule against participants betting on it. Having wagered all he has, the stakes are rudely raised against the racers. Reese's boss, Mr. Frank, has all along been surreptitiously grooming these athletes for a high-stakes death race for the sadistic entertainment of his billionaire gambling buddies. To guarantee every runner's enthusiastic participation, they're abducted, gassed, and fitted with explosive, remote-controlled collars, instilling every lad with a sincere desire to heed the rules and keep his head in the race. Sixty minutes on the clock. Ready, set, go!
A team of Parkour practitioners is abducted by the criminal Mr. Frank that puts remotely controlled necklaces with explosives around their necks to force them to participate in a millionaire gambling death race for their lives. The freerunner Ryan succeeds to deactivate his collar, but the evil Mr. Frank abducts his girlfriend Chelsea. Now Ryan has to reach the evil mastermind to save Chelsea.
