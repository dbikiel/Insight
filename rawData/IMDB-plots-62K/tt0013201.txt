A meek young man must find the courage within when a rogue tramp menaces his home town.
Always the mama's boy, or in this case a grandma's boy, Sonny joins a posse after a tramp accused of robbery and murder. He is unable to conquer his cowardice until Grandma tells him of his grandfather, also a coward, who overcame his fears with the help of a magic amulet. With new courage (and the charm), Sonny captures the fugitive and becomes the hero of the day.
Bespectacled Harold, who was basically born with his trademark horn rimmed glasses on his face, is a meek, cowardly man who has never thrown a punch in retaliation in his life, despite having ample cause to do so. He lives with his Granny, who looks after him more than he is her protector. He is in love with Mildred, whose affections he has to battle for with a bully, who will do anything to show up Harold in front of Mildred. Some actions by Granny to help Harold unwittingly don't help his cause. When the Sheriff deputizes a bunch of young men in an effort to apprehend a gun-toting murderous tramp on the loose, Harold, based on a story by Granny about how his Grandpa became a hero and due to a special idol she gives him, may truly become the man he wants to get Mildred's hand once and for all.
Harold plays a backward, awkward, shy boy who is afraid of everything, including his own shadow. After a bully runs him off from the girl that he loves his Grandma tells him about a magic charm his Grandfather used to gain courage. After Harold begins carrying the charm he singlehandedly captures a killer and teaches the bully a lesson.
