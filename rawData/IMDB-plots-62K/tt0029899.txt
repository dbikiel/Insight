A butler gets elected to the Hungarian parliament where he opposes his master's government.
On election day, Count Albert Sandor, the Prime Minister of Hungary, is surprised to learn that his faithful servant, Johann Porok, has been elected to parliament. Despite their opposing political views, Johann and Sandor amicably agree to continue their butler and master relationship. Sandor's daughter, Baroness Katrina Marissey, however, is appalled to see the eloquent butler opposing her father in parliament.
