Four boys meet at a kiosk during a rainy afternoon. One of them has to study and the other three go to the cinema, although at a young age they are not allowed to enter. Andr√©s works as a bellman in a hotel and dreams of being a bullfighter, "El Chispa" runs his father's kiosk, Carlos is a student, and "El Negro" is a shy boy. They are a group of friends who just want to have fun. However, reality forces them to deal with the problems of the adult world.
