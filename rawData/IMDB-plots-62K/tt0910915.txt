While collaborating with an urban designer (Collins), an architect (Wilson) begins to second guess the perfect life he has constructed for himself and his family.
Will is a rising star in New York City architecture, managing a tough project and negotiating to join an important firm. He rarely smiles. His wife Catherine is on the rise as well, as the social engine of his success. They have a son, about eight. Will hits a bump when he meets Kate, a designer of smaller spaces whose work Will has seen (at his son's school). He recommends her for a project, neglects to tell her he's married, and sort of seems available. She falls hard, then meets Catherine and gets a job offer in L.A. Should Will sign with the big firm, go with Catherine on a dream vacation in the Caribbean, and wonder about Kate in L.A.? A flock of birds may hold the answer.
