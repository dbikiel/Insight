In a sort of "Mad Max" futuristic adventure, an international sport has been established where a driver of a computerized truck must drive across country to an established terminus and not be stopped by other vehicles. The lead truck, called "Monster" has been created by a boy genius and is to be driven by a woman through the course. The only problem is the computer guidance system fails and she ends up in uncharted territories. There she encounters leather-clad hoods who torture her and eventually kill her. Before dying she tells a fellow prisoner about the truck and he uses it to escape. Most of the rest of the film is his relationship ("2001" - Hal-like) with the truck's computer and his avoidance of attacking vehicles. Meanwhile back at the Terminus, the boy genius is ruled by a mysterious doctor, who may have another plan in mind.
