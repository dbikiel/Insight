Since the end of WWII, the United States has acted as the world's policeman. Does it have to be, forever?
American Umpire facilitates a civil, nonpartisan, public debate about the future of American foreign policy. The film features interviews with three former secretaries of state, two American generals, a Nobel Laureate in Economics, a Pulitzer-Prize winning historian, and ten other top experts on American foreign relations all trying to answer the question of what America's "grand strategy" should be for the remainder of the twenty-first century.
