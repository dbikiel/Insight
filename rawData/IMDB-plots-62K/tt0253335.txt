Mexican English teacher Pablo Fernandez seeks a better life for himself and his spoiled daughter Christina (5) after losing his wife in a hurricane. Pablo becomes a tomato picker as illegal immigrant in California. While driving his illegal employer Charlie's truck, he accidentally runs over Dinah Knightly (6), who later dies. Dumb, arrogant detective Bryant and brighter but superstitious rookie Steven Lightning investigate and set chase. Petty would be-TV reporter Soid finds out first and blackmails Pablo to take her along fleeing to Mexico or she'll report him. The Fernandez's make it to Canada. On the road improvisation gets out of hand.
