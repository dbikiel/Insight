A stationary camera looks down several sets of tracks; workmen are on either side. A train comes into view: engine, with engineer leaning out, coal car, and four passenger cars. In the upper left of the frame, the moon shines next to a few clouds. The rest of the sky is dark. The train sweeps by. Someone waves from between a couple of the cars. The look is spectral, because we're seeing a print of the negative.
