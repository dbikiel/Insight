A documentarian named Annie has roped her husband into a project that involves setting up cameras throughout their house. Complications arise when the cameras start showing that same couple in an alternate universe.
"Occupants" is a film about Annie, an award-winning documentarian and her husband Neil. Annie and Neil embark on a "30 Days of Clean Living" documentary, setting up cameras all over their house to document their new eating habits. By doing so, half of their cameras capture a parallel version of themselves - a version that isn't what they expected.
