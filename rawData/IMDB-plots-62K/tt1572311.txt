Posing as a movie producer, a conman attempts to trick an entire village into helping him rob a treasure-laden train.
A stylish Tabrez Khan (Akshay Kumar) is depicted as Tees Maar Khan, a smart conman. He proclaims himself as semi-Robin Hood, who steals from the rich but does not give it to the poor. His life revolves around robbery and frequent visits to jail. Hired by a robbers' duo, the Johari brothers (Rajiv and Raghu), he plans to rob a train full of treasures, thus making it the greatest phenomenon in his life. On his way, he encounters an Oscar-obsessed film star (Akshaye Khanna), a seductive-and-desiring-to-be-a-superstar-some-day girlfriend (Katrina Kaif) and to accompany him in this heist, an entire village. What follows is a brain-less comedy that heralds the Tees Maar Khan's journey through mystics of the robbery.

He also inducts a prominent Oscar-craving Bollywood actor, Aatish Kapoor, to be the lead character in this movie. But his venture will run into problems with the entry of his mother,followed closely by Agents Chatterjee and Mukherjee, Commissioner Khadak Singh, and a headless horseman.
