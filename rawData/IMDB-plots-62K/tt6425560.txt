When the Scooby gang visits a dude ranch, they discover that it and the nearby town have been haunted by a ghostly cowboy, Dapper Jack, who fires real fire from his fire irons. The mystery only deepens when it's discovered that the ghost is also the long lost relative of Shaggy Rogers.
The Mystery Gang head off to a western village, for Shaggy's cousin. But the town is deserted as a ghostly cowboy, who turns out to be Shaggy's ancestor, is haunting it. Meanwhile, Shaggy finds out he has natural talent for horse riding. But the mystery becomes a lot harder to solve with Velma's allergies.
