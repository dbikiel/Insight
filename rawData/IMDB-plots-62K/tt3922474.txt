Paige York is a medical student. She's also a very disturbed young woman, reeling from her father's suicide, and living with her sister in a very dysfunctional relationship. All this is about to change, when Doctor Lucas Emery becomes her new teacher - Sexy, smart, charismatic, this is the man of her dreams, the one she's been waiting for - Soon she'll be hired to help with Lucas' sick wife - until she implements her plan to become the new Mrs. Emery. Lucas' and everyone else's lives will spiral out of control as Paige becomes ever more delusional.
