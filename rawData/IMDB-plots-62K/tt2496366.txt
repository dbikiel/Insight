Stefano and Nader, two teenagers, share their time between a robbery at the supermarket and the mornings at the disco, but their friendship is destined to crack.
Nader, an Italian teenager of Egyptian origin on the verge of adulthood, prefers loafing down the streets of Rome in the company of Stefano, his best friend and of Brigitte, and spending time with Brigitte, his Italian girlfriend, rather than attending classes at his vocational high school. But after a brawl in a disco that goes wrong, Nader's little life is turned upside down.
