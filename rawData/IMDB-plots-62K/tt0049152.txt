A disc jockey tries to prove to teenagers' parents that rock 'n' roll is harmless and won't turn their kids into juvenile delinquents.
Arnie Haines is one of the stars of the new musical genre called rock 'n' roll. He is tired of touring, so he and his band decide to take a vacation in their hometown Mellondale. When they arrive, they are welcomed with great enthusiasm by the local youth. Mayor Bagley interferes and forbids them to play in the town, because he doesn't want them to demoralize the youth. The much-feared columnist Arlene MacLaine is brought to Mellondale by her daughter Francine, who is trying to cajole her mother to appreciate rock 'n' roll. But in Arlene's next column in nationwide media, she denounces Arnie Haines and rock 'n' roll. Francine contacts Arnie. On a visit to the beach they not only make up plans on how to change her mother's opinion, but also fall in love. Their plan is to organize a big rock 'n' roll show in the small town Friesville, and bring her mother there. The local mayor Tom Everett agrees to let them hire Friesville Palladium. His daughter Sunny is immediately infatuated by Arnie, but when he repulses her advances, she gets furious and decides to destroy the show and scandalize the rock 'n' roll artists. Arnie and Francine have to figure out a new plan, whereby they can change the negative opinion of the elder generation.
