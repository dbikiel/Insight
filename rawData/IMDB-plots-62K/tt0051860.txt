The Russian Revolution is finally triumphant in the Fall of 1917. As soldiers, the engineer Henne Lobke and the stoker Jens Kasten show solidarity with the Russians, eventually disarming their officers to stop the sinking of a Russian cargo ship. Back in Germany, the struggle continues. The dock-workers and sailors of Kiel call for a mass strike to demand the end of the war and the abdication of the Kaiser and his officers. At this point, the admiralty decides to launch the operation 'Nibelungen.' The entire German fleet is to be sent to battle the English in a suicide mission that would preserve German honor while crushing internal mutiny. The workers in uniform put aside their differences to stop this, however, as is the case with chief stoker August Lenz, the radio officer Ludwig Bartuscheck and the assistant to the vice-admiral Jupp Koenig. The film ends with the founding of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD).
