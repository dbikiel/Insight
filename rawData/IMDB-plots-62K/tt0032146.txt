Will Parker has been destroyed by a local politician and now must steal to feed his family. He steals a steer from the Three Mesquiteers.
With himself and his father out of work due to Balsinger who controls the jobs, Will Parker is stealing cattle to feed his family. The Mesquiteers try to help him out but he is caught and jailed. Escaping jail and eluding the ensuing manhunt, he heads for Balsinger and a showdown.
While driving their cattle, the Three Mesquiteers; Stony Brooke, Tucson Smith and Lullaby Joslin, are caught in a dust storm and take shelter in a deserted line shack. When the storm ends they discover that one of their herd has been rustled by someone on foot, and they go to the nearby town to find him. As they are about to enter a dance hall, Stony sees a tough, Ed Sims, molesting pretty Irene Parker, and beats him up. Stony loses his wallet during the fight and Irene steals the money out of it. Stony follows her home. There, the Three Mesquiteers learn that Irene's brother, Will, was the man who stole their steer. However, when they learn that the father, Luke Parker, former foreman of a road-construction crew, has been impoverished through the efforts of Balsinger, local politician, they promise to help the old man get his job back. They ride to the state capitol to induce the governor to send an investigating commission to the town.
