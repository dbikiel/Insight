A night at a local bed and breakfast turns into a bloody supernatural fight to the death.
Six friends take a road trip to Galveston in an RV for the wedding of their friend, Kelly (Portia de Rossi). The driver, Johnny, (Oz Perkins), Melody, (Gina Philips) Kate (Bianca Lawson) Christian (Jeremy Sisto), David, (Erik Palladino) and Sara (Ever Carradine) decide to spend the night in the Bed and Breakfast owned by the creepy Mr. Robert Wise, (David Carradine). David has an argument with the chef of the inn, Henri, (Diedrich Bader), and when the chef is found dead and Mr. Wise has a heart attack in the middle of the night, the local Sheriff (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) suspects the group of travelers and tells his Deputy, Enus (Mark Kelly) to seize the keys to their RV and have them stay in Lovelock for the duration of the investigation.Then, the Sheriff arrests "The Mysterious Drifter", (Brent David Fraser) who soon becomes his prime suspect. When the clumsy Johnny accidentally breaks an ancient exotic wooden box belonging to Mr. Wise, he releases the terrible, monstrous "Kuman Thong" and the evil spirit held inside escapes and possesses all the local town folk, transforming them into zombies.Ultimately, Brent David Fraser as "The Mysterious Drifter" becomes our Hero. He is a long time student of powers from "the other side", and a relentless hunter of the dreaded, evil "Kuman Thong". He is the only one who knows how to fight and kill the evil spirit, which he sets out to do with the joining resolve and efforts of Sara and Melody. Can he and the two remaining girls save themselves, and kill the evil spirit, before leaving the destroyed horrible and destroyed Bed &amp; Breakfast, and the pitiful ravaged town of Lovelock behind for good? If they can, they would be leaving the road wide open for a "killer" sequel.Horror Harry and Gory Gary
