A holiday to the South Pacific goes awry when Cousin Eddie's family and a tour guide are shipwrecked on an island.
Unexpectedly, with Christmas just around the corner, the crude and perpetually unemployed Cousin Eddie Johnson, from National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989), wins a worry-free, all-inclusive vacation to a breathtaking tropical island in the South Pacific. However, after a seemingly innocuous boat trip, Eddie's family--along with the heartbroken, Audrey Griswold; the equally sad, Uncle Nick, and the lovely guide, Muka Laka Miki--end up marooned on a deserted islet in the middle of nowhere. Now, it's Eddie's chance to shine. Can he pull off the perfect Christmas out of nothing?
Eddie's boss fires him at Christmastime, then sends him and his family on a South Pacific vacation so Eddie won't sue him after being bitten by a lab monkey. The family gets trapped on a tropical island, but Eddie manages to provide for everyone and prove that he's a real man.
