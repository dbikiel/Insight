A former drug addict gets a new lease of life in his grandfather's dilapidated rural estate, only to face the closed community's unwritten laws. Now, all that's needed is a flaming catalyst. Who can stop the advent of hell on New Paradise?
Like a fish out of water, Vagelis--a former drug addict in his mid-thirties who yearns for deliverance and a big change in his life--finds himself stranded in a faceless and cruel Athens, after five long years of incarceration. Nearly brought to his knees, Vagelis' only way out lies in his grandfather's dilapidated rural estate somewhere in a God-forsaken Peloponnesian village; however, fresh starts are always painful, especially when you are a stranger in a strange land. But, once a pariah, always a pariah, and Vagelis will soon have to come face to face with the closed community's unwritten laws, as a simmering tension threatens to finally boil over. Now, all that's needed is a flaming catalyst--and then--nothing can stop the advent of hell on New Paradise. In the end, just how easily can a king lose his kingdom?
A 35-year old man, just released from jail, decides to make a clean break from the big city and his troubled past. He retreats to the abandoned village his father came from and moves into an old, collapsing house. Alone, far from the bigger village and doing petty jobs to survive, he will strive to find himself once more. Amidst a haze of suspicion and scorn by villagers who treat him an intruder, his past catches up to him in the form of his girlfriend from Athens. Conflict is inescapable
