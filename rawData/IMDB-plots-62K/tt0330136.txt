Sam Roberts thinks he has all the answers: the purpose of life, the meaning of love, the plan for a perfect future. Until Charly walks into his life.
Sam Roberts thinks he has all the answers: the purpose of life, the meaning of love, the plan for a perfect future. Until Charly walks into his life. As different as Salt Lake City and New York City, Sam and Charly are thrown together by circumstance and repelled by differences. He's scheduled and idealistic. She's spontaneous and cynical. He's guarded and practical. She's open and mischevious. He's a Mormon. She isn't. Differences spark interest, though, as Charly finds depth in Sam's idealism and Sam seeks the vibrance of Charly's joie de vivre. But all is not smooth in the Rockies, as their relationship accelerates - cultural differences, family issues, former loves and life-altering challenges threaten to shake things up.
