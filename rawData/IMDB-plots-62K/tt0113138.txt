A young caterpillar yearns to fly like the butterflies and birds, but cannot launch himself high enough to do so - until a couple start playing badminton nearby.
A funny story about how a little caterpillar, who dreamed of flying and looked enviously at birds and butterflies, suddenly found herself in a shuttlecock , in which she was able to fly ahead of time. But this flight disappointed her so much that when she became a beautiful butterfly, the former caterpillar did not want to fly.
