Judge William "Billy" Priest lives in a very patriotic (Confederate) southern town. Priest plays a laid-back, widowed judge who helps uphold the law in his toughest court case yet. In the meantime, he plays matchmaker for his young nephew.
Billy Priest, a proud Confederate Civil War veteran, serves the community in his rural home town as district judge in 1890's Kentucky with common sense and humanity. Priest's deals with everyone from the Daughters of the Confedracy to former slaves with humor and the same lack of pretension. His sister-in-law objects to his nephew Jerome's interest in Ellie May Gillespie, a pretty young girl whose pedigree is unclear. When the mysterious loner Bob Gillis becomes involved in a stabbing incident involving the honor of Ellie May, Priest is asked by a rival to recuse himself from presiding at the trial.
