A homicide detective begins a torrid affair with a senator's son who is a suspect in a series of grisly murders.
What does it take to trust? Melanie Hudson is an L.A. police officer, a loner on the trail of a serial killer who slits the throats of beautiful women just after they have made love. Mel is independent and curious; at night, she drives the streets. Her partner on the force is her ex-lover, Nathan, who still loves her. Their prime suspect is Connor Ashcroft, the playboy son of a powerful U.S. Senator. They investigate him; he's unconcerned and comes on to Melanie. They also interview Connor's former girlfriends and a family shrink. Evidence suggests he's innocent, so Melanie takes Connor up on his invitation; Nathan is jealous and he's worried. Whom should Melanie trust?
