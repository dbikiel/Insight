Little Fedor brings a cat to home despite his mother's distaste for cats. He runs away with his talking cat, to make more friends on the way.
Uncle Fyodor, a very independent urban boy, leaves the parental home with his new pet and friend, the economic cat Matroskin. Friends come to the village of Prostokvashino, where they get acquainted with the local dog Sharik, who points them to a free house. Parents of Uncle Fyodor give a note in the newspaper about the missing boy. This is learned by the rural postman Pechkin, who surrenders the boy to his parents in the hope of receiving a reward - a bicycle.
