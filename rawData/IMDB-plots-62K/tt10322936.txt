You Can't Watch This follows the lives of five high profile conservatives and political dissidents banished from the online world. After introducing each character, the movie recounts how each person came to lose their access to social media and the affect it had on them. With their stories told, each person goes on to discuss the broader issues raised by their deplatforming. Gavin McInnes talks about the necessity for social media for journalists, Laura Loomer describes how there is a war for information - and for access to it. Tommy Robinson questions the morality of mainstream politicians lobbying social media platforms to stop those looking for certain accounts gaining access to them before Paul Joseph Watson explains how the impacts of social media politics are spilling over to affect apolitical creators like Shane Dawson or James Charles. The movie ends asking the question, what form will social media take in ten years time - and how much of a monopoly will it hold on all of our lives.
