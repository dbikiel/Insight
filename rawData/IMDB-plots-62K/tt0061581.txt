After 17 years, things have got too predictable and stale. They argue, they visit a marriage counselor, Richard (drunk) visits a prostitute. They split up. After meeting other people, they are re-united at a night club where they realize that their marriage was better than their divorce.
With two teenaged children, Richard and Barbara Harmon, both from working class backgrounds, have hit a rough patch in their fifteen year marriage. Richard cannot understand why Barbara isn't happy while he feels he has slaved for years, just within the last few years finally to become a business success and good breadwinner. Barbara feels he doesn't communicate well or understand her emotional needs, and that he changed ever since he became that business success which is more important than her in their marriage. Their sexual dry spell is difficult on both, as neither has even contemplated being unfaithful. Taking advice from others, they take measures to protect their individual selves, in the process exacerbating the issue of divorce, which had not even been a possibility before these measures. As they work toward divorce, they have to figure if they truly want a future without the other. Adding to the complicated situation is long divorced couple Nelson and Nancy Downes, the former who is trying to marry off the latter in order not to have to pay alimony anymore and get himself back on his feet. Nancy, in turn, does want to remarry to someone as she is lonely, but will only do so if it makes economic sense. For Nancy, Richard fits the love side of the equation, but not the economic side as long as he has to pay alimony to Barbara. So Nelson and Nancy go on a mission to get Barbara remarried to someone else.
