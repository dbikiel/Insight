A road-movie loosely based on real-life door to door sales program that takes thousands of European students each year to America. Four East-European students: a charismatic sales leader, a nerd, a cute girl and a rookie. 3 months. Six thousand miles from home. In an unbearably hot desert town in the middle of nowhere. Working 16 hours a day. Selling educational comic books door to door to American families. Who will win - they or the 'bookfield'?
