In this spin-off of the Air Bud franchise, five pups follow an ice cream transport truck to a plane and end up flying with the ice cream shipment to Alaska. There they find a pup friend and a boy who needs five dogs for a big race.
Disney's adorable talking puppies are back, and this time they venture to the frosty arctic and team up with new friends in a thrilling dogsled race across Alaska.On a regular school day in the five puppies get locked up in a container full of ice cream buckets, which is to be flown north to Intiuktuk(?) and airdropped in the wilderness. They meet a led puppy, whose 'boy', Adam, wants to drive his own dog-sled (but who presently is missing exactly five puppies). His parents do not want him to pursue this interest.
Back home, the puppies' owners, as well as their dog parents, are looking for them. A 'wanted' mail for the puppies is sent out over the world, but the Intiuktuk sheriff is too inexperienced with computers to get it. The six puppies are trained by a very old super dog, and quickly learn how to do the thing with the sled.
Adam enters the yearly competition with his own, lightweight, sled, and faces some hardships, among which are a snow storm, and a very evil French-speaking dog-sled driver. Adam's parents arrive in time to see their son win the competition, and after the triumph, the five puppies get a regular flight back home, together with their dog parents, who have arrived to the Alaskan town in exactly the same way as the small ones. Back home the heroes are welcomed by their own 'boys' (and one girl).
