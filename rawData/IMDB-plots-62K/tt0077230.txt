"Stars never leave their orbits". The poor astronomy teacher got one more demonstration of this law when he met HER. SHE was "from the another world". SHE was strange and inappropriate in his tiny calm town. Town with slough-like life and citizens who spent all their time gossiping. Once he almost started to believe that the miracle is possible... but "the stars never leave their orbits".
Unbelievable things start to happen in a provincial Romanian town, when a light-minded beauty comes here happy-go-lucky, offended by her fianc√©. The same occasion makes her a friend of a common teacher, who has his own nameless star. An accidental meeting makes them to have a fresh look at their life and themselves. They find in each other what theyve long dreamt of But love turns to be just a beautiful dream. Life has its own rules, which nobody can change.
