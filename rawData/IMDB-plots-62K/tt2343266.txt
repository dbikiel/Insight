A cave exploration in Ukraine leads to the unearthing of a story of World War II survivors who once found shelter in the same cave.
While mapping out the largest cave system in Ukraine, explorer and investigator Chris Nicola discovers evidence that five Jewish families spent nearly a year and a half in the pitch-black caves to escape the Nazis. This is the story of the longest uninterrupted underground survival in recorded human history.
This documentary talks about a long-untold story of World War II: 38 Jewish refugees living in a Ukrainian cave for 18 months. Five surviving members discuss their ordeal in a interview as the film chronicles the accidental discovery of the cave in 1993.
