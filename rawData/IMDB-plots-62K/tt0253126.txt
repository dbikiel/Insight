A nurse eavesdrops with a friend on a cell phone conversation that describes a bank heist. She and the friend then conspire to blackmail the robbers for two million dollars.
Two best girlfriends, Shannon (Minnie Driver) and Frances (Mary McCormack), living in London, suddenly find themselves battling wits with seasoned criminals when they decide to blackmail the culprits of a bank heist in their neighborhood rather than reporting the crime to the Police. Refusing to be played by this new competition and give up the demanded two million dollars, the leaders of the gang of robbers, Mason (Kevin McNally ) and Kerrigan (Sir Michael Gambon), decide to start playing dirty tricks, threaten violence and counterfeit money in an effort to throw the two women off course. When the blackmail and counter attacks hurt an innocent bystander, the kooky best friends must use their friendship to empower each other to lure the hardened criminals into a risky trap.
