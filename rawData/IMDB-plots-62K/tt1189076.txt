When Katie, an ordinary woman, meets Paco, an ordinary man, something magical happens: a love story. From this union an extraordinary child is born: Ricky.
Katie, a single mother living in France with her daughter Lisa, struggles to make ends meet while working at a chemical factory. There, she meets Paco, a co-worker from Spain. Soon, they move in together, and Katie becomes pregnant. Katie gives birth to a baby boy, named Ricky, and she and Paco raise him together in their tiny apartment, along with Lisa. However, it soon becomes apparent that Ricky is no ordinary baby; he develops a pair of functioning wings and becomes able to fly. Soon he is flitting about in their tiny apartment, and together Katie and Paco struggle to raise and handle the ever-growing Ricky.
