On the set of a playwright's new project, a love triangle forms between his wife, her ex-lover, and the call girl-turned-actress cast in the production.
The film centers on a call girl/escort-turned-Broadway-thespian Isabella/Izzy/Glowstick (Imogen Poots) and follows the recurring intersection between these two facets of her life. Broadway director Arnold Albertson alias "Derek" (Owen Wilson) pays for her escort services (and did for others), despite being married to Delta Simmons (Kathryn Hahn), the star of his new play A Grecian Evening. The playwright Josh (Will Forte) falls for her as well, despite the fact that hes already dating her therapist Jane Claremont (Jennifer Aniston), whose alcoholic psychotherapist mother (Joanna Lumley), is in rehab in Tuscany for six months, leaving all her patients to her daughter.[6] Actor Seth Gilbert (Rhys Ifans), the counterpart to Delta Simmons in the play, has been in love with her for years. The intertwined relations of all roles lead to misunderstandings, hiding in the bathroom, and various surprises.
