Javier, a thirty-year-old doctor, is about to travel to Miami to meet again with Mar√≠a, his wife, until she calls him to confess that he has fallen in love with another and that the relationship is over. Desperate, Javier tries to take refuge on the sofa of his psychoanalyst, his friends and the dog he has just bought. However, love will give you a second chance when you meet Julia.
Javier and Maria live together. Discontent with life in Argentina, they plan to migrate to Miami in search for a better life. Since Maria has a US residency, they hastily marry and she flies ahead. He resigns his job, sells his car and apartment, and packs his things. On the way to the airport he receives a call from Maria, she doesn't want him to come over. She's confused. She's involved with somebody else.
Javier is destroyed. He's a walking ghost, constantly pestering his friends, family and shrink about Maria, about getting her back. He goes through a complete duel period, every stage documented in clever if not completely original comedy.
Finally getting back to his senses, he tries to set out again and find somebody. Getting "it" back is difficult and he's bad (very) at it. After a few mishaps, he meets someone, Julia. An emotionally scarred but sweet clerk at the pet store, and things seem to work, slowly but promising.
Then Maria's father has a heart attack and she returns, all confused again, asking Javier to love her again. He's nice but (finally) in his right mind, sensitive, but not biting. The duel is over. He's ready to live again.
