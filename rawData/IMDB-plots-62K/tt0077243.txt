Five friends get together and decide to plan an operation to rob a bank. The main difference between this and other bank-robbing gangs, however, is that all five men are blind.
The Americans are planning to send five million dollars to Southeast Asia for relief work. They plan to send it to a bank in Manila and the President of the bank goes to the U.S. to work out the details. He is later approached by someone who wants him to steal the money and turn it over to them. He learns that they want him to use 4 blind men to get the money. So he recruits them and brings them to Manila and recruits a woman who teaches the blind to train them. Eventually they recruit a local bank robber who is also blind to help them.
