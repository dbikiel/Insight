Based on a true story of the American Civil War, culminating at the Battle of New Market, May 1864. A group of teenage cadets sheltered from war at the Virginia Military Institute must confront the horrors of an adult world when they are called upon to defend the Shenandoah Valley. Leaving behind their youth, these cadets must decide what they are fighting for.
In the midst of the prolonged and deadly American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln appoints a very different kind of general, Ulysses S. Grant, as Chief of Union Forces. Grant acts decisively. He brings total war to the pristine Shenandoah Valley, breadbasket of the South. The superintendent of the Virginia Military Institute volunteers to send the 274-strong Corps of Cadets to protect the valley. The young cadets march northward toward the strategic valley's choke-point of New Market. On the day of battle, Confederate general John C. Breckenridge, former Vice President of the United States, and commander of southern forces in Valley, is faced with a horrible decision. When Southern forces are jeopardized, he orders the young cadets into battle.
