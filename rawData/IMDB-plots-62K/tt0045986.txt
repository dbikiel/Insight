When a disgruntled rancher and his sons rob at gun-point a rival rancher, the town forms a posse to go after the culprits but the ensuing events are muddled by unclear facts, false testimony, old scores, secrets, murder and stolen money.
When the anxiously awaited posse returns with neither prisoners nor the stolen money, we learn in flashback what happened. Having been cheated by Sampson Drune, a father and his two sons have robbed him and fled. A posse led by Drune took off after them and although unwanted, the town's drunken Sheriff joined them. The Sheriff's influence on Jeb, the adopted son of Drune, was the key to Jed later revealing who killed Drune, the robbers, and what happened to the money.
Complicated by flash-backs and flash-forwards, a posse of basically honest citizens track down a trio of outlaws responsible for a wealth New Mexico cattle baron, and decide to keep the recovered money for themselves. Honest Sheriff John Frazier (Broderick Crawford), an alcoholic, leads the posse and is mortally wounded during the foray and is unaware the cash has not been returned to its rightful owner. He is expected to die at any moment and, as far as the greedy men in his posse are concerned, the sooner the better.
