An undercover MI6 agent is sent to Berlin during the Cold War to investigate the murder of a fellow agent and recover a missing list of double agents.
The crown jewel of Her Majesty's Secret Intelligence Service, Agent Lorraine Broughton (Theron) is equal parts spycraft, sensuality and savagery, willing to deploy any of her skills to stay alive on her impossible mission. Sent alone into Berlin to deliver a priceless dossier out of the destabilized city, she partners with embedded station chief David Percival (James McAvoy) to navigate her way through the deadliest game of spies.
Just before the fall of Berlin's wall in 1989, the lethal MI6 secret agent, Lorraine Broughton, is sent to Cold-War Germany to meet her contact, the station chief, David Percival, after the murder of a fellow undercover agent. Intent on recovering an invaluable microfilm containing the list of names of every British spy, Lorraine must do battle with endless waves of hard-as-nails KGB agents and unrelenting henchmen, in the bowels of a city at boiling point. Under those circumstances, as both sides want the list desperately, whom can Lorraine trust?
In November 1989, just days prior to the collapse of the Berlin Wall, MI6 agent James Gascoigne is shot and killed by KGB agent Yuri Bakhtin, who steals The List, a microfilm document concealed in Gascoigne's wristwatch that contains the names of every intelligence agent (on both sides) active in Berlin. Ten days later, Lorraine Broughton, a top-level MI6 spy, is brought in to be debriefed by MI6 executive Eric Gray and CIA agent Emmett Kurzfeld about her just-finished mission to Berlin. The plot jumps between the debrief room and flashbacks to Lorraine's time in Berlin..
