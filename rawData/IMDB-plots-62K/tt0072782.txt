The beginings of the Algerian Revolution as seen through the eyes of a peasant.
Winner of the prestigious Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1975, Chronicle of the Years of Embers portrays Algeria's struggle for independence from French colonial rule. The story follows a peasant's migration from his drought-stricken village to his eventual participation with the Algerian resistance movement, just prior to the outbreak of the Algerian War of Independence.
