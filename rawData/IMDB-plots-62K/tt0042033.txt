A group of treasure hunters search for a wagon load of gold, buried years before in Death Valley.
A long-lost gold treasure, believed buried in the sand dunes of the fabulous Walking Hills, attracts adventurers Jim Carey (Randolph Scott), a rancher; Shep (William Bishop), rodeo rider wanted for murder; Old Will (Edgar Buchanan); Chalk (Arthur Kennedy); Frazee (John Ireland), a detective hunting Shep; Johnny (Jerome Courtland), a cowboy and Josh (Josh White), an entertainer. Uninvited, Chris Jackson (Ella Raines, loved by both Jim and Shep, joins the treasure-hunters. Hard work, suspicion, danger and intrigues and hatreds culminate in a grim fight with shovels, and a raging desert sand-storm leads to the conclusion.
While tailing a murder suspect, private detective Frazee follows the suspect into a poker game. When one of the players reveals he knows the location of a lost wagon train full of gold, everyone in the game is suddenly bound up in an expedition into the desert to find the treasure. But heat, sand, wind, and the revelation of personal secrets combine to threaten not only the treasure hunt but the lives of the hunters as well.
