Germany is one of the most democratic societies in the world, and has the fastest growing Jewish community in Europe. This never could have been imagined in 1945. Through personal stories, the film explores the country's transformation from silence about the Holocaust to facing it head on.
Informative documentary that looks at two things: the process by which the German public has gradually become capable of addressing what happened during WW2 and in the Holocaust in particular; and the process by which Jews have gradually felt that it is possible to feel at home in Germany despite the traumatic legacy of the Holocaust.
