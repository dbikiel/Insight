Balloon kingdoms, dopey police dragons and happy wizards are exactly how Terry remembered his Grandmother's wacky fairy tales. Except they are real and it's definitely not as 'cheerful.'
A WIZARD'S TALE is a magical family adventure story that sees a young kid named Terry (Toby Kebbell) whisked away to the colorful Kingdom of Groovynham. The evil wizard Grump (Ian McShane) has cast a spell of gloom over the land and as such, smiling and laughter are now a thing of the past. Terry must travel the Kingdom in search of a spell that will help get everyone's happy back and along the way help Princess Dawn (Lily Collins), outwit all manner of strange and wonderful creatures, and try an embrace a little thing called "change".
