The story of a shy boy who gets convinced by his parents to spend a few summer days in the mountains. So, he joins a group, and the vacation begins. Unfortunately, things turn out to be a little tough for our small friend.
An experienced guide (Vic) accompanies a city boy (Alan) and his three friends on their first wilderness experience. Hoping to teach the four boys lessons not only about the wilderness, but about themselves, Vic pushes them to the limit. Soon after alienating the boys, Vic finds himself in desperate need of help and must rely on his students in order to survive.
A coming of age tale in which a geeky little boy's parents are convinced to send their son on an outdoors adventure by the group leader. The boy, Alan, is forced to change from a technical thinking, baseball-listening loner into a man of action leader. The movie chronicles the challenges set before Alan by nature, crew leader Vic, and the violence of other crew members. When the time comes will Alan be able to save a crew member's life with his new leadership skills?
