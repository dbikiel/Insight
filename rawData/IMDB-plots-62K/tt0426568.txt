A budding producer searches for the country's best young magician.
Professional magician Mystic Max hosts a reality TV show. It allows the winning three teams of minors, would be-TV directors and cameramen and the best young magicians some of them present, to go on to a final competition at Hollywood's Magic Mansion. Pushy nerd Allyson Miller was lucky enough to 'discover' Danny Sinclair, who performs unseen tricks with stunning surprise, yet often lacks any confidence. In between the competition tests, Danny goes searching for the mansion's secrets, hidden by founding magician Antonio De Milo. Finding those is only part of a confusing confrontation in which Max's part is unclear.
