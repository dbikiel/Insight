You thought you'd heard it all in the barbershop, but you haven't heard anything yet - the women get their own chance to shampoo, shine, and speak their minds in Beauty Shop.
Gina has moved to Atlanta and is working in beauty shop run by the stuck up boss Jorge. Although she mostly enjoys working at Jorge's, Gina's real dream is own her own beauty shop. One day, after Jorge insults her and takes credit for her work, Gina quits the salon and opens up her own beauty shop with her friend and ex workmate from Jorge's Lynn. Gina's beauty shop becomes well known as a place to get great hair and speak your mind. However when Gina's shop starts taking Jorge's clients, he's out for revenge. But Jorge underestimates the power that Gina and her fellow co workers have.
Gina Norris is a long way from the Barbershop - she's moved from Chicago to Atlanta so her daughter can attend a prestigious music school, and she's made a name for herself at a posh salon with her cutting edge hairstyles. But when her egotistical boss, Jorge, takes credit for her work, she leaves the salon with shampoo girl Lynn in tow to open a shop of her own. Gina buys a rundown salon and inherits a motley group of headstrong stylists, a colorful client√®le, and and a sexy piano-playing electrician, Joe. It's a rocky road to fulfilling her dreams, but you can't keep a good woman down.
