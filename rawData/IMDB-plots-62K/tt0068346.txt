Enrico Mattei helped change Italy's future, first as freedom-fighter against the Nazis, then as an investor in methane gas through a public company, A.G.I.P., and ultimately as the head of ENI, a state body formed for the development of oil resources. October 27, 1962, he died when his private airplane crashed, one minute before it should land at Milan airport. Officially, he died of a flight accident. Actually, many journalists explored other plausible reasons for the untimely landing of the small aircraft.
This is the enigma and the mystery surrounding Enrico Mattei. It is a mosaic which surrounds a narrative film...not chronological but emotional. It ranges from the world-war to post-war period to now, from Milan to Russia from North Africa to Iran, from Monte Carlos to Sciily where Mattei spent the last day of his life, promising the most-underdevelopment area of Italy the hope of work and well-being. Mattei, 'the oil czar," "the white Communist," "the emperor of the Republic," "the man of disorder" will attempt to explain himself and his motivating force. The film is open-ended, as open-ended as the history of economic and social progress in Ital, as the history of the third world, the capital, oil revolutions and wars.
