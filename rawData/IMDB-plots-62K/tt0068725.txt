Hotel Monterey is a cheap hotel in New York reserved for the outcasts of American society. Chantal Akerman invites viewers to visit this unusual place as well as the people who live there, from the reception up to the last story.
New York City's Monterey is a residence hotel; the residents we see are older, most live alone. The camera, usually stationery, begins with a look into the lobby. The film ends with a panorama from the hotel's rooftop. There's no soundtrack. The lobby is clean with granite floors. Men wear hats. People enter and exit an elevator. The camera looks out from within the elevator as doors open and close. People sit alone and motionless in their apartments. There are long shots of empty halls. Paint peels. The flooring on upper levels is linoleum. Hall lights are florescent. Doors open a crack then close. The film provides the feeling of what it's like to live there.
The Monterey is a single room occupancy (SRO) hotel housing the disadvantaged and marginalized in New York City. Over an approximate twelve hour overnight period, cameras, with no audio, film in and outside the hotel: the human and mechanical workings of the hotel, the movements of some of its residents (who seem aware but nonplussed by the presence of the camera itself), inside some of the rooms with their specific resident, with a final montage in the early morning dawn of a panorama of the hotel exterior. The early scenes are with the camera stationary merely observing what happens in front of its lens. Some of the scenes inside the actual units with their respective residents are still photographs which present in particular a sense of desolation. Some of the final scenes allow the camera to pan, most specifically up and down hallways, to provide a more active view of what is happening inside the hotel.
