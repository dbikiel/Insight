During WWII, a human heart taken from a certain lab in Europe (Dr. Frankenstein's) is kept in a Japanese lab, when it gets exposed to the radiation of the bombing of Hiroshima. The heart grows in size, mutates and sprouts appendages, and eventually grows into a complete body and escapes. Later, a feral boy with a certain physical deformity (a large head with a flat top) is captured by scientists who refer to the boy as Frankenstein. The creature grows to the height of 20 feet, escapes again, fights police and army, and is practically indestructible. Later, a reptilian monster goes on a rampage. Eventually the Frankenstein creature and the reptile face off in a terrible battle.
The heart of Frankenstein's monster is stolen from Dr. Frankenstein and taken by U-boat to Japan. The heart is immortal. When caught in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, it begins to grow. Several years later a disfigured wild-boy is discovered stealing peoples livestock and eating a school's pet rabbit. Drs. Bowen and Togami keep the boy under surveillance, handcuffed. He grows at an enormous rate and eventually escapes his chains by chewing off his hand, which survives and crawls around until it dies of malnutrition. Frankenstein (as Bowen and Togami choose to call him) is blamed for destruction of the countryside near Mount Fuji, but Akira Takarada swears he saw another monster at the scene of the disaster.
