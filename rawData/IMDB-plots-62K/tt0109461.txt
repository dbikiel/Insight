Gabriele is a successful antiques dealer in Paris, but he's dogged by dreams of his childhood in Italy, where he was raised by a loving mother, the kept mistress of Gabriele's father, a wealthy patriarch. When she dies, Gabriele is "adopted" into his father's affluent family, but his bastard status elicits resentment and cruelty from his step-brothers. Still hurting and haunted years later, Gabriele hatches a plan for revenge.
