A clever King and his brilliant chronicle keeper hunt for the truth behind a crime that threatens the throne and the stability of the country.
During the Joseon Dynasty, power was persistently threatened by political and social tug of wars, often leading to crimes and cover-ups. King Yejong, makes a point to gather evidence related to these criminal activities and solve the cases, bringing those responsible to justice. As King does this, a brilliant young man, Seo, is appointed as King's chronicle keeper. The King immediately realizes that Seo is the perfect aid for solving crimes. The young man nearly has a photographic memory and is lightning fast at recalling details. And his arrival at King's side couldn't have come at a better time. In Hanyang, there is a particularly strange case that King is drawn to. Part of his interest comes from a rumor that the event stemmed from an effort to dethrone Yejong. Sensing opposition brewing, Yejong recruits Seo to help him discover the truth behind the unusual, and potentially treasonous, incident.
