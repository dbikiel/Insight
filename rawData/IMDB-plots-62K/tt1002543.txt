Documentary about Santiago, a peculiar man who used to work for the director and his parents as a butler. The material was filmed in 1992 but, for some strange reason, the director felt he couldn't edit it and put it aside. In 2005 he remembers the unfinished film and starts its edition.
In 1992, Brazilian director Joào Moreira Salles filmed his Argentinean butler Santiago Badariotti Merlo, who was born in 1912 and had worked for thirty years for his family in the huge house of their own in Gávea. Two years later, Santiago died and the film was left aside. In 2005, João Moreira Salles decided to edit the material and release the documentary about Santiago.
