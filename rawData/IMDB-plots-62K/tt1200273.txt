Facing eviction from his parent's home on his 30th birthday, a socially awkward guy meets the girl of his dreams and creates his own rules for growing up.
Herman Spooner still lives with his parents in Monrovia on the eve of his 30th birthday; He sells used cars (badly), fantasizes about his own apartment, is socially isolated, and tries to talk a good game. When he helps Rose, a young woman with car trouble who's driving home to Oceanside before flying to a teaching job in the Philippines, he's smitten. He inflates his resume, gets her a tow to the car lot, puts her at the head of the queue for repairs, and recommends a local hotel for her overnight stay. He visits her there that night and later contrives to get her to stay. Is there any hope for Spooner in this relationship, or is it another case of his letting fantasy take over?
