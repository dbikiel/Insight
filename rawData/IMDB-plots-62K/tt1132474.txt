Throwing instead of pulling its punches, this is the story of Isa (as he's actually named, but who finds the nickname Chiko much cooler) who grows up in a Hamburg suburb. It might be one of the world's richest cities but every beast has its belly and here, in the very underbelly, Chiko lives in a world where violence, staking and keeping a claim, and drug taking are the norm. Where down is not an option, Chiko is determined to rise to the top, whatever and whomever it costs. Regardless of time and circumstances, he wants immediate and unlimited respect. And with the means justifying his ends, for Chiko every means is justified. [D-Man2010]Isa goes by the nickname Chiko, and lives in a Hamburg suburb.
