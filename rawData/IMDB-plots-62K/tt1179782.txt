A two-bit actor faces challenges after he is asked by Police to impersonate a look-alike gangster.
A struggling actor(Ranvir Shorey) gets caught up with the 'wrong people' because his face is identical to an underworld don Raje. An opposing gang plan to murder the don and put the actor in place of him at the helm of the don's empire and act as their puppet. But, things don't always go according to plan.
Struggling two-bit actor, Virender Kumar Agarwal, witnesses two encounter specialists carry out an assignment on Marine Drive, and reports it to the police. When the specialists are told, they find that he resembles a gangster, Rajendranath Sahay, they not only abduct him, but compel him to impersonate the latter. He quickly learns about Rajendranath, and for a sum of Rs.1 Crore agrees to act as the gangster. The specialists then kill Rajendranath, and induct Virender successfully in his place. He is taken to the Sahay residence, and finds that Rajendranath lives with his mother, and a wife, Revati; two school-going sons, Tilak and Keshav; and a brother, Mannu. Afraid of being caught, he is terrified of even conversing with anyone, familiarizes with his new family, and quite mysteriously refuses to establish contact with the police. Watch what happens when the police attempt to assert themselves in order to compel Virender to carry out their bidding.
