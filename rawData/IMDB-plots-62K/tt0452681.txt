Santa, aka Scott Calvin, is faced with double-duty: how to keep his new family happy, and how to stop Jack Frost from taking over Christmas.
Now that Santa/Scott Calvin and Mrs. Claus/Carol Calvin have the North Pole running smoothly, the Counsel of Legendary Figures has called an emergency meeting on Christmas Eve! The evil Jack Frost has been making trouble, looking to take over the holiday! So he launches a plan to sabotage the toy factory and compel Scott to invoke the little-known Escape Clause and wish he'd never become Santa!
Santa's got problems: it's a few days before Christmas and production lags, Mrs. Claus is about to give birth to their first child and wants family time, and Jack Frost (tired of second billing) is on probation under his supervision. He tries to support his wife by bringing her parents to the North Pole (to preserve his secret, they must think it's Canada). He also brings his ex-wife Laura, her husband Neil, and their daughter Lucy. Inside the toy factory, Jack makes mischief and hatches a plan to become Santa. With Santa juggling that many snow globes, something is bound to go wrong. But if things get too difficult, he can always exercise his option to invoke the Escape Clause. Will he?
With Christmas quickly on the way, Santa is faced with one problem after another. Production on the toy line is going down the drain. Santa's wife is about to give birth and he plans to spend time with her, his in-laws (who think Santa is a toymaker in Canada) and his ex-wife Laura, her husband Neil and their daughter Lucy. On the other hand, trouble is brewing when the malicious Jack Frost starts causing mayhem by demolishing the factory. And if things are way too out of line, there's always the option to using the Escape Clause.
