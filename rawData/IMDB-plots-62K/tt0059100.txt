A secret vampire cult, which has its headquarters beneath the town cemetery, searches for victims for its human sacrifice rituals.
In a sleepy town in Britanny, Armond du Moliere, the Count Sinistre, and his Gypsy bride Tanya, vampires, control everything through a dark, bloody cult. English tourists disturb their cave coffins and must die, but Paul Baxter escapes and takes with him the count' golden bat talisman. To retrieve it and exact revenge, the whole cult follows to England, lusting for blood, a cover-up and new recruits, which also causes jealousy.
