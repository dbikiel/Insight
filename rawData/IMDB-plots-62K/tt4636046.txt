A woman tries to mend the broken pieces of her last life, as she is now involved in a new relationship with a man.
A young divorcee living with her son in a small northern city of Iran, wants to marry the man she has fallen in love with. According to the current rules, the father has the custody of children; however, her ex-husband has granted her that right on the condition that she doesn't remarry. Struggling to keep both of her beloved ones, she has to think about the third option: Temporary Marriage (Sighe). However, this will get her into a predicament, as despite its being legal, Sighe is not well-received by the society at all. Would temporary marriage be a good solution for her?
Nahid, played by Sareh Bayat, has fought her way through a difficult divorce from her gambling-addicted husband. She has escaped with custody of her son, Amir Reza, and her freedom on one condition: that she never remarries. Financially struggling to support herself and the troublesome Amir Reza on her typist's wage, her prayers are answered in the form of Masood, a widower and successful business owner. Will she marry Masood at the risk of losing custody of her son or is there a way to navigate her husband's divorce terms? Reminiscent of Farhadi's 'A Separation', director Ida Panahandeh takes a look at Iran's strict divorce laws, but with the additional complication of the controversial 'temporary marriage'.
