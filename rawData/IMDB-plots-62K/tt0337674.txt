Simon is a down-on-his luck artist who gets no breaks from any quarter. While out working as a street sketch artist, he stumbles across the construction site for a new museum that is very obviously stolen from a design he created as an architecture student. Enraged, he storms into the office of architect Vincent Porel and demands an explanation, but is immediately hauled out by security. When the police arrive to arrest Simon, he makes a break for freedom, only to be accidentally struck down in the street by Porel himself. As Simon lays dying on the hood of Porel's car, his soul is transferred into the body of a newborn baby, none other than Porel's own son, born at that very instant. Remembering his past and realizing that he is now in the care of the man who stole his work and killed him, Simon resolves to make his new father's life hell.
