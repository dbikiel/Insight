A portrait of a small Moravian village and its quirky inhabitants.
A bitter comedy about the difficult lives of young people living in an isolated part of North Moravia. The story is a confrontation of relations between various lovers. The heroes and heroines feel neither the strength nor much reason to commit themselves on a permanent basis because they are all incessantly aware of their social situation, which limits their hopes and yearnings and often turns them into a parody.
