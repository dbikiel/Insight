A broken family finds their relationships to one another changed by a new arrival in the household.
While re-evaluating her life as a newly single mother, a woman relies on her carefree son and his awkward brother to keep their lives interesting. When an unlikely romance blossoms between the youngest son and the new girl in town, she realizes the key to her happiness can be found where she least expects it, and there's only one kind of love worth living for - the crazy kind.
After Augusta Iris kicks Gordie, her artist husband, out of the house over his extramarital affair, she spends weeks in bed, barely speaking, consumed by grief and repressed anger. When her stoned-out teenage son, Henry, a high-school dropout who mows lawns, learns that his father is living with a lover, he builds a bizarre sculpture in Dad's studio to work out his rage. Meanwhile, Henry's asocial brother, Mathew, a Harvard PH.D. candidate in chemistry, returns home to comfort Mom. A recluse and health-food fanatic, Mathew hides in his room to avoid Bette Mack, Henry's feisty live-in girlfriend, who attempts to revive the comatose family with peppy advice and sassy critiques.
