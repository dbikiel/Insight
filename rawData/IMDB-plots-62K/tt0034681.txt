A young man visits his fiancée in a remote French villa where her scientist father resides. There he meets Noel, Dr. Renault's mysterious assistant, who has a strange attraction to Renault's daughter. Soon he learns Noel's true identity: he is an ape that was turned into a man by Renault's bizarre experiments!
Dr. Larry Forbes arrives in a small French village on the eve of Bastille Day in order to be reunited with his fiancée Madelon, niece of the respected Dr. Renault, Because a rainstorm has washed out the bridge, Forbes must stay at the local inn, where he meets two of Renault's servants, gruff gardener Rogell, an ex-convict from a family of criminals, and gentle, sensitive Noel, the doctor's chauffeur, who explains his strange appearance by claiming to be Javanese. A misunderstanding results in Forbes' room being occupied by a touring hunter who ends up strangled. The following day Noel drives him to the doctor's châteaux. Noel seems very attached to Madelon and becomes disturbed when he learns she is soon going to be leaving him to be married. After a dog is found hanged on the estate, Larry has many questions about mysterious Noel and Dr. Renault's hold over him.
