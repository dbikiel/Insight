Master Wong and his disciples enroll in the 'Dancing Lion Competition' to stop an assassination plot and to battle an arrogant, deceitful opponent.
Wong Fei-Hung and sidekick Chung arrive in Peking just as the Empress announces a Lion Dance martial arts contest. Also accompanying him is cousin Yee, his young, Westernized aunt-by-adoption, to whom Wong is secretly betrothed. Wong faces a possible romantic rival in a Russian diplomat, Tumanovsky, whom Aunt Yee knew back in school, and a martial arts rival in the brutal Club Foot, who beats up Wong's father. Club Foot works for the slimy Leung Fun, who is determined to win the prestigious Lion Dance contest at any cost. However, by the time the spectacular Lion Dance contest occurs many things will change.
