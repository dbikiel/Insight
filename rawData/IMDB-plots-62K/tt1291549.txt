When an awkward teen meets his favorite porn star, whose career peaked in the '80s, an unexpected friendship follows as the young man gets a glimpse inside Monica Velour's current life as a single mom struggling to make ends meet.
In this coming-of-age comedy, awkward high school graduate Tobe Hulbert leaves on a road trip to meet Monica Velour, his favorite '80s porn star, at a rare appearance hundreds of miles away. Instead of the glamourous sexpot portrayed on screen, he finds a 49-year-old single mom living in a trailer park in rural Indiana, performing at seedy strip clubs to make ends meet. Starry-eyed and captivated by his crush, Tobe befriends Monica, further complicating her troublesome life; she has to deal with custody over her daughter, a deadbeat boyfriend, her uncompromising and somewhat regrettable legacy, and constant ridiculing for her life choices.
