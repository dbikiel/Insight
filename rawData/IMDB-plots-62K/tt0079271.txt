A conservative Midwest businessman ventures into the sordid underworld of pornography in California to look for his runaway teenage daughter who is making porno films in California's porno pits.
Jake Van Dorn is a businessman from the American heartland who shares strong Calvinist convictions with most of his countrymen. His teenage daughter is missing from her church youth convention trip to California and Van Dorn hires a private investigator to find her. The result of the investigation is his daughter is spotted in a cheap X-rated movie. Van Dorn decides to bring her back personally and during the quest he becomes familiar with the pornographic underworld.
After waving goodbye to his only daughter, the quiet teenage Kristen who is going off to California with her Sunday school, the Grand Rapids businessman and strict Calvinist, Jake VanDorn, receives the worst phone-call a father could ever get, only a few days later. Mysteriously, his beloved Kristen has disappeared--and as the police seem unable to help--desperate Jake hires the private detective, Andy Mast, to trace his child. Instead, the investigator returns with an 8mm hardcore porn movie with the missing person performing in it, leaving Jake no choice but to delve deep into South California's obscure underworld of prostitution to bring her back. But who knows where Kristen is?
