Retired Sherlock Holmes and practicing Dr. Watson come back together to solve a puzzle in the beginning of the 20th century.
The 20th century begins. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson left the house No. 221b on Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes went to Sussex and started beekeeping. Dr. Watson got married and returned to medical practice. Mrs Hudson also left Baker Street, but ordered to create a Sherlock Holmes museum in the living room. Inspector Lestrade retired. However, in the new century there were new, much more dangerous criminals implicated in politics and international relations. Europe was on the verge of a major war.
