A henpecked New Jersey grocer makes plans to move to California to grow oranges, despite the resistance of his overbearing wife.
The owner of a general store (Harold Bisonette) is hounded by his status-anxious wife ("That's 'Bee-soh-nay'" and "I have no maid you know"). To get some sleep he goes out on the porch where he is tormented by a little boy from the floor above (Baby Dunk) and an insurance salesman down below ("LaFong. Capital L, small a..."). He uses an inheritance to buy an orange ranch through the mail, then drives off with his family for California. The orange grove consists of a withered tree, the ranch house is but a shack, and the car falls to pieces. But a racetrack operator wants the land, so all ends happily.
The henpecked Harold Bissonnette dreams of owning a orange grove in California but his wife won't hear of it. He currently runs, not very successfully, a small fruit and vegetable store where he seemingly can never have on hand the stock that people want to buy. Coming into an inheritance he buys a farm sight unseen and soon the family heads off to California. At first blush, his investment seems to have been for naught: the farm was abandoned long ago and has long been considered inadequate for growing oranges. All seems lost until someone comes along with another use for the land.
