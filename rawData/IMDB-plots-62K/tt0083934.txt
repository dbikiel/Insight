Spoof based (loosely) on an old Indonesian film, which has had the old foreign soundtrack removed and replaced by an over-dubbed English track. Central character is a female wrestler who has decided that she no longer wants to wrestle, but whose mother (a former wrestler herself) wants her to keep wrestling to make money so her brother can have the operation (his seminal vessels run to his skull, rather than his groin, which purportedly will cause his head to explode if he gets too excited). During the course of her story (in which a number of brawls ensue), she is befriended by a Elvis-impersonating martial artist.
An Indonesian woman wrestler wants to stop wrestling, but her mother asks her to keep on until they will have enough money between them to pay the operation of the wrestlers brother. The young man needs an operation urgently, because of a strange organic malfunction: his sperm goes to his head, instead of his natural way out of his body.
