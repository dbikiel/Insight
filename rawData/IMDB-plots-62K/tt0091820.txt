When mobster James Moretti (Michael Nouri) is about to be indicted, one of his people thinks he can get to Adam J. Warner (Ken Howard), the Vice President to stop it. So he arranges for lawyer Jennifer Parker (Jaclyn Smith) to get a job at a prestigious law firm. He knows Parker had an affair with Warner and Warner is the father of her son. When she meets him, she has nothing but contempt for him because his brother tried to kill her. Moretti thinks that Parker owes him, so he tells her to tell Warner to stop the indictment. Parker reconnects with Warner much to the consternation of his wife.
