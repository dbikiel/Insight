Millions in diamonds are stolen from a safe in NYC and later the burglar is killed. Shamus is paid $10,000 by the owner to find the diamonds or killer.
New York private eye Shamus McCoy likes girls, drink and gambling, but by the look of his flat business can't be too hot. So an offer of $10,000 to finds some diamonds stolen in a daring raid with a flame-thrower is too good to miss. His investigations soon get pretty complicated and rather too dangerous. At least along the way he does get to meet Alexis.
