Jennie the terrier has everything a dog could ever wish for, but still feels that something is missing. She leaves home to discover what that is.
Jennie, a terrier, has it all -- but leaves home after deciding there must be more to life. In a distant town, she learns that the Mother Goose Theatre needs a leading lady. She applies; the manager tells her she lacks experience. She's not sure what that is, but sets out to get it. A cat who drives a milk truck provides Jennie with breakfast and a ride to a white house that's in need of a nanny; the catch is that if the nanny can't get the baby to eat, it's down to the basement where a lion resides. Can Jennie gain the experience she needs without becoming the lion's lunch? And, indeed, is there more to life, or in a land of lions and squalling babies, is there no place like home?
