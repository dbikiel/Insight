The story of the New York accent, as told by New Yorkers.
From Atlantic Ave. to Zerega Ave., word on the street is the New York accent is disappearing -- a casualty of a city that's evolved into a vast expanse of banks, H&amp;Ms and glass-blown high-rises. But even though you may not hear "toity-toid and toid" in Manhattan, you can still hear strains in Bensonhurst, Whitestone or Tottenville. Or you can have a look-see through our film. We've gathered some accent experts, official and non, to weigh in on what it means to tawk the talk in a city that may be slowly trying to quiet the noise.
