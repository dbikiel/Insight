Stan and Jack seek work at a bus driving holiday camp after being fired from the bus company for crashing two buses, only to find Inspector Blake works there also.
Sacked by the bus company Stan and Jack get jobs as drivers ferrying punters to and from a holiday camp and arrange for the rest of the family to come and stay. Blakey is there as the chief security guard and manages to get caught in accidental compromising situations with the camp's nurse. The Butlers head for one disaster after another as Jack and Stan,still chasing women half their age,take two girls for a bus trip on the sands only for the bus to sink in as the tide approaches. Olive gets into bed with someone else's husband when she makes it back to the wrong chalet in the dark and 'little' Arthur sprays the chalet with ink,requiring a re-painting job. The holiday over Arthur's sidecar combination manages to come apart on the way out as it did on the way in.
Due to a female passenger falling out of her top whilst running for the bus Stan is distracted and crashes the bus resulting in the depot managers car being written off. As a result Stan, Jack and Blakey are fired. Stan and Jack soon get new jobs as a bus crew at a Pontins holiday resort but discover that Blakey has also gotten a job there as the chief security guard. Stan, realising that he can get a cheaper rate for his family gets them to arrive at the resort for a holiday, but things don't quite turn out the way all three new employees wish.
