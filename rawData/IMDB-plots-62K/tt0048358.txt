In Kansas, fearing another Indian War, Sheriff Bat Masterson, Marshal Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday join forces to defuse tensions over grazing lands between Indians and greedy cattlemen.
Dodge City Sheriff Bat Masterson is out to prove that a group of cattlemen have framed Merrick for murder because he negotiated a treaty granting the Kiowas a reserve in the grass country that the cattlemen wanted for their own grazing land. Knowing that the tribes will wage war again if Merrick is executed, Masterson begins a search for Clay Bennett who testified he saw the murder. Joining him in the hunt is Marshal Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday, both for different purposes. Although Masterson and Holliday have a long standing feud, the latter is persuaded by Merrick's daughter Amy to help.
