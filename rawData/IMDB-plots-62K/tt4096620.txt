Set in the desolate desert spaces of the American southwest, the film unearths the history of land art during the tumultuous late 1960s and early 1970s. Troublemakers is ultimately a story of renegades and firebrands all willing to risk their future careers on radical change and experimentation-a marked contrast to the hyper-speculative contemporary art world of today. Featuring rare interviews with a veritable who's who of American Art of the twentieth century.
