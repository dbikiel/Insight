After copper miners discover part of the frozen tail of a prehistoric monster in Lapland, scientists inadvertently bring it back to life.
A portion of the tail of a prehistoric reptile is discovered in Denmark. It regenerates into the entire reptile, which proceeds to destroy buildings and property and generally make a nuisance of itself. It can fly, swim, and walk, and has impenetrable scales, which makes it difficult to kill.
Copper miners in the tundras of Lapland discover a frozen piece of reptilian tail belonging to some unknown prehistoric creature. Taking the specimen to an aquarium in Copenhagen, Professor Martens (Asbjorn Andersen) gets more than he bargained for when the tail regenerates into a giant, acid spitting monster that terrorizes the country. The Danish military, led by U.N.-appointed American general Mark Grayson (Carl Ottosen) attempts to hunt down the monster and destroy it, only to realize that blowing the thing up will create hundreds of little creatures.
