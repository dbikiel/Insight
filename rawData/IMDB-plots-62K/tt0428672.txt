The educated Fariba Tabrizi flies from Teheran to Germany expecting to have asylum, since she is persecuted in Iran due to her lesbian relationship with her beloved Shirin. However, her application is denied by the authorities and Fariba has to return to her home country. When her recent acquaintance Siamak, who is grieving the death of his brother, commits suicide, Fariba assumes his identity and status of political refugee and is sent to a refugee camp in a German village. Fariba finds an illegal work in a cabbage factory and she has many difficulties for not having bath with the other male workers. She becomes close to her colleague Anne and they fall in love for each other. However, prejudice and her illegal condition jeopardize her exile in Germany.
Survival is not enough. Fariba Tabrizi has made it. Under peril of death she has fled from Iran. In Germany she has no alternative way of avoiding the threat of deportation other than to assume the identity of a deceased co-detainee. So what happens after a few month in which she has tried to come to terms with a situation which is actually an insufferable one for her? How does Fariba live not only in this external state of exile but also in an inner state of exile? The term "in orbit" is officially used by the UN to refer to asylum-seekers who find themselves orbiting around planet Earth because they can actually find legal domicile nowhere at all.
