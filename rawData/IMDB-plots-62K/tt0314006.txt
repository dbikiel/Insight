Uday dreams of becoming a police officer and serving his country. His dream is accompanied by a fierce determination and drive to make his dream come true. Even as he courageously treads on his chosen path, he is confronted by the face of evil in the form of a crooked police officer, Shankar. But Uday soon meets with a television employee named Kaveri and once again finds his life upside down.
Kaveri, a television employee, is disgusted with the manners of a police inspector named Shankar, whom she sees urinating in a public place and confronts him. He is enraged and attempts to strike her, but he is prevented by her friend Uday Shinde, a police cadet. Humiliated, wounded, and angered by Uday's interference, Shankar asks the police department in vain to conduct a manhunt for all young men named Uday. He does come across Uday when he abducts Kaveri forcibly and has her beaten up by a policewoman. Uday is beaten severely at the police station and left for dead on a railway track. Uday survives, but soon he is on the police department's wanted list for killing Deshmukh, a prominent politician. And Shankar has convinced the police commissioner to issue shoot-on-sight orders for Uday.
