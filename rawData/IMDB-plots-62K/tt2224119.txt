Complicit follows the trail of Edward(David Oyelowo) an MI5 officer desperate to foil what he believes is another 7/7 style atrocity planned by British terror suspect Waleed (Arsher Ali) despite the lack of any conclusive evidence. Edward, confronted by the key moral dilemma of our time, is forced into choosing between two morally devastating outcomes.
Dismayed to have passed over for promotion by less able colleagues with better connections MI5 employee Edward Ebuko sees his opportunity to prove himself when he suspects hate preacher Waleed Ahmed of being a terrorist planning a ricin attack in Britain. However with no real evidence to back up his theory his superiors do not take him seriously. After poring over emails and CCTV footage he links Ahmed to a visit to a known terrorist in Yemen and catches up with him in Cairo,taking him in for questioning. Ahmed knows how far his captors can go and quotes his rights as a British citizen and denies everything. However a determined Edward resorts to torturing his suspect and gets a result - an address in Britain where the ricin is being manufactured. It looks as if he has won - but has Ahmed been been lying to him all along and what will be the consequences?
