A literary agent is pursued by the charming writer of a popular magazine while she attempts to sway one of her clients, a handsome but innocent college professor, to star in an upcoming movie based on his best-selling novel The Whirlwind.
The Whirlwind, written by Anthony Street (pen name only), is the best selling novel of the last ten years, its success largely attributed to agent Carol Ainsley - the daughter of an actress and a US senator - she who has already sold the movie rights further to capitalize on the success she's already generated. No one except Street's publisher knows his real identity. Henry Pepper, Associate Editor of Knickerbocker Magazine, is assigned by his boss to write a multi-installment article on the success that is Carol Ainsley. Carol is amenable to the idea until she learns that Henry does not want to write a standard biography, but rather an in depth profile of her workings, she reluctant to make public many of her working secrets, especially anything that may place her or her company in a bad light. Her next step, which she has the exclusive contract to do, is find the actor to play the hyper-masculine, romantic yet adventurous lead character of the Whirlwind, the identity of that actor who seems to be elusive at least to her and her staff. This difficulty is one of those items that she does not want Henry to know. However, based on what she learns of Street written in the inside jacket of The Whirlwind, she believes he would be the perfect person to portray his own character. She does whatever she can to find, convince and train "Anthony Street" to be the Whirlwind, which may not be as easy as it sounds and which may have unintended consequences. And she has to do it under the watchful eye of Henry, who takes great pleasure in making her life as difficult as possible, he having more than one motive for his madness.
