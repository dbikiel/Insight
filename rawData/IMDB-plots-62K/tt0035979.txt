An old roué arrives in Hades to review his life with Satan, who will rule on his eligibility to enter the Underworld.
Henry Van Cleve presents himself at the gates of Hell only to find he is closely vetted on his qualifications for entry. Surprised there is any question on his suitability, he recounts his lively life and the women he has known from his mother onwards, but mainly concentrating on his happy but sometimes difficult twenty-five years of marriage to Martha.
When he dies, Henry Van Cleeve is convinced that he will never gain admission to heaven and so immediately goes in the other direction. The man in charge, referred to as His Excellency, asks Henry to tell him his life story not convinced he qualifies for eternity down below. Henry was born into a well-to-do family and never had to worry about money. As with many a young man of means, he liked to party and have a good time. On his 26th birthday, he meets his cousin Albert 's beautiful fiancée Martha and they elope that very evening. They are happy for many years but Henry never really changes his bad habits and as a man about town, has many lady friends. Martha leaves him but realizing he will never change his womanizing ways, moves back in. Now at the gates of hell, his eternal life is in the hands of His Excellency.
