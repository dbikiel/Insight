Sara joins Julliard to fulfill a lifelong dream of becoming a Prima ballerina, but she soon falls in love with hip-hop and a young composer - both of whom challenge her ambitions.
Sara joins Julliard in New York to fulfill her and her mother's dream of becoming the Prima ballerina of the school. She befriends her roommates, Zoe and Miles, who teach hip-hop classes. She has ballet classes with the rigid and famous Monique Delacroix that she idolizes - Monique requires full commitment, discipline and hard work from her students. When Miles, who is a composer, invites Sara to help him compose the music for the dance choreography Sara's passion for hip-hop is sparked and she also falls in love with Miles. When she is assigned to perform Giselle in an important event, she feels divided between the technique of the ballet and the creative work offered by Miles.
Fresh from her experience at an inner-city Chicago high school, Sara Johnson (Izabella Miko) begins her first year at Julliard, where new obstacles await her. First, she becomes a favorite student to her teacher and mentor, Monique Delacroix (Jacqueline Bisset), which only enrages a rival ballerina (Maria Brooks). Then, she meets a cute guest lecturer (Columbus Short) who causes her to rethink all of her choices.
