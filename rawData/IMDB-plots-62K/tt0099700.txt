The Gremlins are back, and this time, they've taken control of a New York City media mogul's high-tech skyscraper.
An army of malevolent little monsters take over a high-tech corporate skyscraper when a cute and intelligent exotic pet is exposed to water. The "Mogwai's" owner joins forces with the Trump-like head of the corporation to regain control.
A few years after the incident in Gremlins (1984), Billy and Kate have moved to New York City where they work for media mogul Daniel Clamp. Meanwhile, Gizmo's former owner has just died and he's been captured for the genetics part of the Clamp building. A little while later, a certain someone gets wet, creates a new Gremlin species, and learns to finally fight back after years of abuse, and while Gizmo and the surviving humans fight back, the Gremlins and their evil leader, the Brain Gremlin, are planning to escape when it gets dark, and if they do, New York City will experience a new Hell.
Yesterday it was rural Kingston Falls. Today it's the Big Apple, and lots of wild, anarchic comedy, because a new batch of mischievous green meanies is on the loose. We told you. Remember the rules. You didn't listen. Now you'll have to face up to the hilarious consequences.
