The patriarch of a distinguished but crumbling Dallas family is forced to hit the town with his daughter's punk rock boyfriend.
Dallas oil magnate Max Hagan is being helped through yet another messy divorce by his record executive daughter Beth. When his soon-to-be-ex forces him out of his mansion, he finds himself tangled in a wild night of sex drugs and rock-and-roll with his daughter's boyfriend, the punk-rocker/computer programmer Raff, and manages to strengthen the bond with his dysfunctional family.
Wealthy businessman Max Hagan has hit some hard times, but his situation worsens when his grasping soon-to-be ex Barbara throws him out of his house without a penny in his pocket. Max finds a new ally in Raff, the boyfriend of his daughter Beth, whom he has unjustly dismissed as a ne'er-do-well. During a wild evening on the town with Raff and his wild rock chick friend Felicia, Max gets his priorities straightened out and finally reconnects with his family.
