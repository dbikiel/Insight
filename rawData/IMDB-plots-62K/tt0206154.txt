Two French girls get lost in the woods and accidentally enter the realm of sorceress Morgana Le Fay - who gives them the choice of either staying young forever as her lovers, or rot in a dungeon for eternity.
While traveling in Auvergne, two young women, Anna and Françoise, unwillingly venture into the realm of Morgane, the Fairy Queen. Now, to go on living throughout the centuries, Morgane must obtain the souls of the ladies who cross her kingdom. To those who accept her pact she gives eternal youth and beauty. As for the ones that object to it, she lets them rot in the dungeons of the castle. Anna signs the pact but not Françoise, determined to escape the all-female lesbian community of the Fairy's court...
The girlfriends Françoise and Anna are traveling through the countryside of France by car. They stop at a roadhouse to drink wine and buy coffee, and the owner advises them to return. However they proceed their trip but they get lost on the road. They decide to spend the night in an abandoned barn. In the morning, Françoise does not find Anna and she seeks her out. Out of the blue, the dwarf Gurth asks her to follow him and he shows a castle in an island where Anna would be. Françoise takes a boat that sails alone and brings her to the castle. Sooner she learns that she has reached the lesbian realm of the witch Morgane that proposes Françoise to stay in her kingdom living in eternal youth and beauty with her favorites Yael, Sylviane and Sarah. Otherwise she would be doomed to get older and older in the dungeons of the castle. Further, Françoise learns that Anna has given her soul to Morgane and will stay in the place forever. But Françoise does not want to stay and plots a plan to escape.
