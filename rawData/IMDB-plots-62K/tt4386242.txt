Teenage friends must resist the spell of an evil showman staging a house of horrors show in their small town.
A small town Halloween festival finds itself intruded upon by an evil carnival with designs upon imprisoning and feeding off the souls of unwary teenagers. Targeted are four high school friends, who's two leaders, Kellen and Beth (not quite a dating couple), suddenly find themselves with alternate romantic choices (namely, carnival temptress Lilith and tall, dark, handsome transfer student Hunter). As the stroke of Halloween midnight approaches, who will wind up entombed in the carnival's dire Cabinet of Souls forever?
When the Hall of Horrors show arrives in Danville, several high school friends can't wait to get scared. As they navigate through the monsters, zombies and ghouls, they discover the showman and his assistant are trapping the souls of lost teens.
