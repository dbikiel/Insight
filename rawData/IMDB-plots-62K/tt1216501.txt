An overweight teenager girl struggles to be socially accepted.
Princess is a heart-warming drama-comedy about overweight 18 year old Maja, whose size makes it difficult for her to be socially accepted and to make her dreams come true. It is an intimate story about people and their dreams - unfulfilled, suppressed and lost. About waiting for the world around you to fulfill your dreams vs. finding happiness in who you are, no matter what reality you live in.
In a hopelessly small town somewhere in long and narrow Sweden, lives Maja, eighteen years old. Her life's dream is to become an actress. She wants everyone to see her, the beautiful person she is on the inside. Only, it's a little hard to see. Heavily overweight, clumsy and socially inept, Maja struggles to realise her life's dream during her final term at high school. Young not-so-successful documentary filmmaker Erika runs into Maja by chance and sees the opportunity to make entertainment out of Maja's seemingly hopeless struggle, but she is soon captured by Maja's warmth and never ending enthusiasm. Maja's road to success is lined with comedy and tragedy, as she constantly has to face the prejudice against people with the wrong appearance. Yet she struggles on regardless, trying to find the strength and self esteem necessary to really take center stage - on her own terms.
