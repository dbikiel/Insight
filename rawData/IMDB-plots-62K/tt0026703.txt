Merlusse is a teacher in an all-boys boarding school - pupils hate him since he smells, has a glass eye and is very strict. When Christmas Eve arrives most boys leave school to spend the holidays with their families but a small group of lonely boys is left behind with Merlusse as their overseer. Merlusse doesn't get along with the boys very well and they pull various tricks on him but on Christmas Morning boys wake to find a huge surprise waiting for them...
