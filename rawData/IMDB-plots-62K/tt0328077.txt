The twisted tale of Kenneth, socially insecure technical writer who forms an obsessive relationship with "Nikki", an anatomically accurate silicone sex doll he orders over the Internet. Because of his experience with his new toy, Kenneth's life takes a turn for the better when his newfound romantic skills attract the attention of Lisa, a co-worker at his office. But when the doll's jealous personality invades his consciousness, Kenneth becomes trapped in a perverse triangle, torn between the dominating, silicone Nikki and the flesh-and-blood Lisa.
In Los Angeles, the lonely yet efficient technical writer Kenneth Winslow is challenged to write three long technical manuals in a very short period. His boss Novak assigns the temporary typist Lisa Bellmer to help him in the task. In the office, Kenneth's colleagues show him an expensive rubber sex doll called "Nikki" on the Internet, and Kenneth decides to buy it. When Nikki is delivered, the snoopy manager of his building becomes curious with the huge package. Kenneth reads Nikki's manual and uses the image of Lisa to give a sort of "personality" to the doll and he starts practicing kink sex and becomes obsessed with Nikki. Meanwhile, Lisa feels out of place in the office, Kenneth helps her and they get close to each other, having a love affair and the disturbed Kenneth gets rid off the doll. When Lisa finds Nikki's brochure in the volume one of the manual, the world of the twisted Kenneth falls apart and Kenneth becomes completely deranged with tragic consequences.
