Charts the trials and tribulations of Ana, a free-spirited 26 year-old returning home to Strasbourg for the summer after living abroad for long enough to feel out of place everywhere.
After a failed attempt at working on a foreign film set, 26 year-old Ana returns to her hometown of Strasbourg. Over the scorching summer that follows, she decides to replace her grandmother's bathtub with a walk-in shower, eat peas and carrots with ketchup, drive a Porsche, harvest plums, lose her driver's license, sleep with her best friend and get back together with her ex. In short, over this particular summer, Ana tries to get her life together.
BADEN BADEN charts the trials and tribulations of Ana, a twenty-six-year-old returning home to Strasbourg for the summer after living abroad long enough to feel out of place everywhere. Like many in her generation, Ana lives a life teetering on the edge between comedy and melancholy. She is strong but full of self-doubt, tomboyish but sweet, temperamental and impulsive, innately clumsy, vulnerable, erotic - and rebellious. Her embodiment of contradictions presents a charming, fascinating, and, above all, thoroughly complex portrait of a young person.
