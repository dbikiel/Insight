An American photojournalist gets caught in a political struggle at El Salvador in 1980.
A journalist, down on his luck in the US, drives to El Salvador to chronicle the events of the 1980 military dictatorship, including the assasination of Archbishop Oscar Romero. He forms an uneasy alliance with both guerillas in the countryside who want him to get pictures out to the US press, and the right-wing military, who want him to bring them photographs of the rebels. Meanwhile he has to find a way of protecting his Salvadorean girlfriend and getting her out of the country.
Oliver Stone's fictionalized account of journalist Richard Boyle's year in El Salvador during very turbulent times in 1980-81. Down and out in San Francisco, Boyle and a colleague Doctor Rock head to El Salvador in his beat up car. There he manages to reunite with former girlfriend Maria and her younger brother. Boyle is naturally suspicious of government officials who see the communist guerrillas as a major threat. As Boyle continues to push local and U.S. Embassy officials for answers he soon becomes a target and must find a way to flee - with Maria - before he too becomes one of the disappeared.
