'Foreign Parts' portrays a hidden enclave of automobile shops and junk-yards fated for demolition in the shadow of a new baseball stadium in Queens. The film observes this vibrant community of immigrants - where wrecks, refuse, and recycling form a thriving commerce - as it struggles for daily survival and contests New York City's development scheme.
