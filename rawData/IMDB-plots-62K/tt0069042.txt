Olsen has a plan - rob over DKK4,000,000 from an armored car with police escort using a hot dog stand, some ducks etc. Can the gang hide the money safely?
After his usual stay behind bars, Egon has another cunning plan involving millions. They rob over 4 million from a money transport. The gang keeps a low profile and hide the money. But it's stolen by "Kongen" and "Kn√¶gten", who immediately start living it up - in the penthouse suite at the Sheraton. The suitcase with the money changes hands several times, before Kongen's daughter takes of with all the money.
