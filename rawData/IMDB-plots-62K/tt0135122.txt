A wall full of advertising posters comes to life.
On a large wooden billboard crammed with colourful posters of all sorts, a vacant empty space is reserved in the middle. Before long, a worker plasters a beautiful advertisement of a well-dressed Parisian lady--and as a pair of cheerful police officers pass by--a miracle happens and the inanimate characters come to life. But, what kind of powerful magic would revive the lifeless images? And what will happen now that they have tasted the sweet air of freedom?
A workman glues an advertisement in the center of other adverts on an outside wall along a city walk. It's an ad for "love on credit," featuring a comely lass. The posters come to life, interacting with the characters in the surrounding adverts: a publican's wife is jealous of his talking to the midnight cutie; a cook dumps food on a character beneath him. Then, two flics walk by, and the characters become inanimate. After the cops walk on, life returns. The poster people attack a swell beneath the wall, and he runs for the cops. They return, and the wall falls on them, revealing a gate behind which the poster folks laugh. Chaos ensues.
