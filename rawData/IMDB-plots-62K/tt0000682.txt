The first all-animated film in history, a series of scenes without much narrative structure, but morphing into each other.
Much to our amazement, with the use of chalkboard hand-drawn animation, the caricaturist Ã‰mile Cohl conjures up the stick figure of an agile and pliable clown as he encounters a plethora of ever-shifting objects. Without a doubt, the transformations seem endless, in an attempt that is considered to be the very first animated cartoon.
