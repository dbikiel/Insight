A tramp steals a girl's handbag, but when he tries to pick Charlie's pocket loses his cigarettes and matches. He rescues a hot dog man from a thug, but takes a few with his walking stick. When the thief tries to take some of Charlie's sausages, Charlie gets the handbag. The handbag makes its way from person to person to its owner, who is angry with her boyfriend who didn't protect her in the first place. The boyfriend goes to throw himself in the lake in despair. Charlies helps him.
Chaplin takes entirely too much interest in a "spooning" couple on a park bench and is thrown off for his inquisitiveness. He flees and is knocked over by a projecting limb of a tree and falls into a baby buggy, thereupon the nurse maid proceeds to give him a pummeling. In his flight he runs into a tramp who has "lifted" the pocketbook of the girl "spooner." The tramp picks Chaplin's pocket of some bologna sausage, but while he does it Chaplin extracts the pocketbook from the tramp's pocket with his cane. A giant happens along and the three fight for the spoils. Bricks are thrown and both the giant and the tramp are "knocked out." Both "spooners" also are struck by the flying bricks and "laid out cold." When they wake up the girl finds her pocketbook gone and accuses her sweetheart. She then jilts him. He goes to the river to commit suicide, but has not the courage to jump in. Chaplin finds him and after taking the man's watch and money helps him carry out his wish to die by kicking him into the river. The rest of the party find a policeman and pursue Chaplin to the water's edge. The policeman tries to arrest Chaplin. A fierce battle ensues, in which Chaplin hurls them all into the water.
