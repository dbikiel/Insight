Something happens when Sarah, Marley and Emma visit their aunt Cora. A strange creature is killing people one by one. The only way to survive from the creature: to hide until dawn.
It's Halloween eve on Shelter Island, and the small town is preparing for a killer storm. But the dark clouds gathering over the island are bringing with them a curse a hundred years in waiting. As the woods give birth to an ungodly and insatiable creature of fire, bones, and earth, three sisters must scramble to stay alive through the long dark night of the Hollow. For it's not something you can kill. It's only something you can try and survive.
Attempting to escape from their gloomy past, three sisters ferry to a mysterious island for Halloween despite admonitions and presentiments. A foreboding storm brings with it a being of pure evil. Made of earth and fire, this invulnerable creature's thirst for revenge is only outweighed by its blood lust. The sisters must outrun and outsmart this malignant spirit until the light of day, or the retreat from their fiery past will engulf them in someone else's.
