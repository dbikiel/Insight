After his young daughter is kidnapped, a war hero takes matters into his own hands while detectives unravel the mystery surrounding the unusual crime.
Still reeling from the death of his wife, U.S. military veteran Dane Hunte (Daniel Joseph) now works as a truck driver to support his young daughter, Eden (Trinity Valenzuela) while his brother-in-law, Todd (Michael Urie) looks after the child. One night, a violent home invasion at Todd's house results in his partner, Ross (Ryan Spahn), in a coma and Eden kidnapped. The tenacious Detective Fini (Scout Taylor-Compton) is assigned to the case and begins tracking down leads. But as the hours tick by and no suspects are taken into custody, Dane decides to take matters into his own hands. Unencumbered by the law, he follows clues into the city's criminal underbelly and soon finds himself closing in on the perpetrators. The two investigations become entwined in a heart-pounding race against the clock to save Eden and serve justice to those responsible for the crime.
