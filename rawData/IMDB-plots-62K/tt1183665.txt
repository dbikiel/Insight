A look at the lives and relationships among girls at an elite boarding school.
At an elite girls boarding school, the award winning diving team is considered the premier group of girls in the school. When a new girl from Spain, Fiamma, comes to the school and joins the team, the rest of the squad is jealous of her relationship with the coach and force her off the team and out of the school by bullying her. When the girl is forced to rejoin the group, they decide to let her into their social circle and begin to be as fascinated with her as their coach is. But things take a turn when the coach's fascination turns into a physical relationship between Fiamma and herself.
Within the confines of a strict, all-girls English boarding school (circa 1930s), a clique students participate on the swim team not only to pass the time, but to be close to their swimming instructor, the enigmatic, yet charismatic, Miss G (Eva Green). While Miss G originally encourages their idolization and crack (crush) on her, the teachers attention is quickly focused on the arrival of an exotic and beautiful Spanish foreign pupil, Fiamma (Mar√≠a Valverde). As the new girl rebuffs her classmates, and further rejects Miss Gs interest, her teammates begin to grow jealous of Miss Gs fascination with Fiamma, and resent the latters distain of their instructor, accumulating in the inexplicable disappearance of Fiamma.
