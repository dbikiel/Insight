The Punk rock ethos is alive and well and redefined by 3 artist-driven record labels: Hydrahead Records, Neurot Recordings, and Constellation. They all combine hard-to-define, heavy music with a visual aesthetic that has enraptured worldwide fans, without the need for radio or corporate media outlets. Spanning five years of documentation, this film features: Neurosis, Isis, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Thee Silver Mt. Zion, Pelican, Jesu, Cave In, Oxbow, Evangelista, and others. Additional footage presents interviews with the bands, label heads, and artists that create the album covers, posters, and visual aesthetic that fans value as much as the music itself. This film is both a dedication to these bands and an answer to those who question where the spirit of punk rock is today.
