A melodrama about a woman governor whose husband is accused and convicted of a bombing and the dilemma she has to struggle with --- whether to let the law take its course and the pressures put on her by family, friends and political pundits.
In an unnamed "western state" where women can vote, an all female political party fields a lady lawyer, Clara Madison, to run for superior court judge, which she wins after her husband declines to run against her. A fierce opposition newspaper editor is killed at the hands of bomb throwing Italian anarchists, yet Clara's husband is implicated with them, and may be sentenced to death if she won't intervene.
A newly elected female judge must battle both a gang of bootleggers and a local tabloid newspaper. When the newspaper's editor is murdered, the judge's husband is arrested and tried for the murder. She must prove him innocent and find the guilty parties.
