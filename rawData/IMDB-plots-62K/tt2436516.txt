A group of friends, just looking to have a good time in a rave party on a remote island in Goa, find out that the island is infested with Zombies.
Two friends, Luv (Vir Das) and Hardik (Kunal Khemu) are going through bad times. Luv has learned that his girlfriend has been cheating on him and Hardik is this close to being fired from his job. They both badly need a break and when their roommate Bunny (Anand Tiwari) informs them that he is going to Goa for a presentation, they jump at the chance for a vacation. Once in Goa, Luv meets a girl, Luna (Pooja Gupta) who invites him to a rave party organized by Russian mafia on a remote island. At the party, an experimental drug is introduced. Then, come morning, things go totally wrong for the three hapless guys and the girl. As it turns out, the untested drug has a deadly side effect...
Hardik (Kunal Khemu) and Luv (Vir Das) are two dope heads who tag along to Goa with their buddy, Bunny (Anand Tiwari), on his business trip. Luv comes across a free-spirited girl, Luna (Puja Gupta) who casually invites them to an exclusive underground rave party on a remote island! The party is headed by the macho Indo-Russian Mafioso, Boris (Saif Ali Khan). But something is not right on this island. All of a sudden, they are accosted by zombies! Where did these zombies come from? And who is Boris really? And why has this cold-hearted drug-dealing don come to save their lives? Together they need to get out of the infected island!
