When Prohibition ends, a beer baron sees the writing on the wall, quits the rackets, and tries to break into California society.
Prohibition is ending so bootlegger Bugs Ahearn decides to crack California society. He leases a house from down-on-her-luck Ruth and hires her as social secretary. He rescues Polly Cass from a horsefall and goes home to meet her dad who sells him some phony stock certificates. When he learns about this he sends to Chicago for mob help.
As Prohibition ends, beer baron Bugs Ahearn sees the handwriting on the wall for bootlegging, sells all his assets, and with friend Al Daniels moves from Chicago to Palm Springs. The socially ambitious Bugs hopes his cultural pretensions and ill-gotten gains will help him break into society. Although he rents a large mansion from real estate agent Ruth Wayburn, he doesn't know that her father once owned the estate before a business-venture-gone-bad put him in the poorhouse. Ahearn hires her to manage the household as he tries to impress beautiful socialite Polly Cass. The only thing that impresses this high-class gold-digger is his bankroll, and complications arise when her father, the same con man that bilked the Wayburns, talks Bugs into investing in his tanking company.
