The story of the great sharpshooter Annie Oakley, who rose to fame while dealing with her love/professional rival, Frank Butler.
A story very loosely based on the love story of Annie Oakley and Frank Butler who meet at a shooting match. Fabulous music although the lead characters have virtually nothing to do with the actual historical figures. Annie joins Frank Butler in Col. Cody's Wild West Show. They tour the world performing before Royalty as well as the public at large.
Buffalo Bill's (aka William F. Cody) Wild West Show is touring the country, and one of its acts is sharpshooter Frank Butler, who at each stop challenges the town's best sharpshooter to a competition. In Cincinnati, he goes up againstVhis better; a woman, and filled as she rose to fame while dealing with her rival - who's also her lover.
Annie Oakley is an incredible shot who was raised 'Doin' What Comes Naturally'. Frank Butler, the star sharpshooter in 'Colonel Buffalo Bill''s show, however, knows full well that's not how 'The Girl That I Marry' must be. Anyway, not at least until he finds that 'My Defences are Down'. Though Annie defiantly says 'Anything You Can Do I Can Do Better', she realizes that 'You Can't Get a Man With a Gun'. The victor at the end is love; as you know, 'It's Wonderful'. After all, 'There's No Business Like Show Business'.
