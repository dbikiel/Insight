An enigmatic gang leader known as "The Boss," who is a dead-ringer for Simon, puts "The Saint" under suspicion of murder.
Simon has arranged to send a rare mummy of a pharaoh from Cairo to Phildelphia to his good friend, Keystone University archeology professor Horatio Bitts, whose beautiful daughter does not escape The Saint's attention. Ruthless gang leader Duke Bates, known as "The Boss," is a dead ringer for Simon and a notorious jewel smuggler who uses the mummy to disguise a cache of illegal diamonds. After Bates murders a shady jewel cutter and the professor, Simon finds himself under suspicion... even by his old friend, Inspector Fernack.
When a lookalike for The Saint smuggles diamonds into the U.S. from Egypt, the real Saint has his hands full proving his own innocence and getting the diamonds back.
