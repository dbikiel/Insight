An ex-convict's plans to turn legit go awry.
After spending more seven years in prison, the criminal Tommy is released and his former partner Mick is waiting for him to take him home. Mick is an ex-convict that is straight now, working as a janitor in a porno shop and living in the decadent and filthy Golden Eagle hotel in Los Angeles. He tells Tommy that he has saved 2.5 thousand dollar and has bought two tickets to Las Vegas for them. Mick's intention is to find a job in a casino and begin a new life with his old friend in a nice place. The dirty Golden Eagle is a joint where prostitutes meet clients and losers and decadent people live. When Mick goes to work his last night in his job, Tommy brings the prostitute Amber to the room to have sex with her. Amber works with her friend Sally on the streets and their pimp is the strong Rodan that is luring the fifteen year-old runaway Loriann, promising that she will become a cinema actress. Tommy fails with Amber and she mocks him. Tommy gets angry and kills Amber. When Mick returns to his room, he finds her body. Will that be the end of Mick's dreams?
