On the H.M.S. Defiant, during the French Revolutionary War, fair Captain Crawford is locked in a battle of wills against his cruel second-in-command Lieutenant Scott-Padget, whose heavy-handed command style pushes the crew to mutiny.
H.M.S. Defiant's crew is part of a fleet-wide movement to present a petition of grievances to the Admiralty. Violence must be no part of it. The continual sadism of Defiant's first officer Lieutenant Scott-Padget (Sir Dirk Bogarde) makes this difficult, and when Captain Crawford (Sir Alec Guinness) is disabled, the chance for violence increases.
During the Napoleonic Wars, Captain Crawford (Sir Alec Guinness) takes command of H.M.S. Defiant and is ordered to rendezvous with the fleet in Corsica. With his son aboard as a new midshipman, Captain Crawford takes an even hand with his crew. This does not sit well with his second-in-command Lieutenant Scott-Padget (Sir Dirk Bogarde), a cruel officer who is also well connected, and someone who has proven to be the downfall of his previous commanding officers. As a battle of wills ensues, Scott-Padget uses Crawford's son in an attempt to get Captain Crawford to lash out against him. With the men on the verge of mutiny, they must also face the enemy.
