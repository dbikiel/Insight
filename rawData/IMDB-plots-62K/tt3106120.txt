An undertaker's birthday party is interrupted when Jacob Goodnight rises from the dead and proceeds to terrorize her and her friends.
A group of friends pays a late-night visit to the city morgue to surprise Amy (Harris) on her birthday. But the surprise is on them when the one-eyed corpse of brutal psychopath Jacob Goodnight (Jacobs) unexpectedly rises from a cold sub-basement slab. Their wild party quickly turns into a terrifying slay-fest as the sadistic mass-murderer resumes his savage rampage complete with hooks, surgical knives and power saws.
After the tragedy at the Blackwell Hotel, the bodies of Jacob Goodnight and nine of his victims are transported late night to the city morgue. The EMTs try unsuccessfully to revive Jacob. The crippled Holden, Seth and Amy are working in the graveyard shift and Seth and Amy bring Jacob's corpse to the scale room. But Amy's brother Will and her friends Kayla, Tamara and her boyfriend Carter come to the morgue to celebrate her birthday. The weird Tamara goes with Carter to the scale room where Jacob is to have sex with her boyfriend. Out of the blue, the serial-killer awakes in the beginning of a night of terror.
