Documentary account of the AIDS crisis in Uganda.
Abbas Kiarostami and his assistant, Seifollah Samadian, travel to Kampala, Uganda at the request of the UN's International Fund for Agricultural Development. For ten days, their camera captures and caresses the faces of a thousand children - all orphans - whose parents have died of AIDS. Recording tears and laughter, music and silence, life and death, the film attests to Africa's sunny resilience in the face of so much suffering and disease.
