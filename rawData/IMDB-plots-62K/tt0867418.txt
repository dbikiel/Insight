Arrgh. It's horror on the high seas when Scooby-Doo and the gang take a creepy cruise into one of the world's most mysterious places - the legendary Bermuda Triangle.
Scooby and the gang take a mystery-themed cruise through the Bermuda Triangle, but what starts out as staged hi-jinks soon turns into the real thing. Ghost pirates are prowling the legendary waters of the Triangle, searching for a priceless treasure and someone on board the cruise ship may hold the secret to it's location. Now Scooby and the rest of gang will have to solve the real mystery behind the mysterious treasure or they may end up walking the plank to sink to the depths of Davy Jone's Locker! New songs by Paul James Prendergast and a duet by Rich Dickerson and Gigi Meroni are sure to please.
