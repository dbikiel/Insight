An old soldier kidnaps a young General of an enemy state and takes him on a long journey to collect the reward.
Two armies clash in ancient war-torn China; none survive but a young general from a royal house and a farmer foot soldier who binds the fallen leader to take him home and claim a reward. Many stand in their way: an abandoned songstress, the noble's own murderous younger brother, desperate beggars, rough slavers, and the pair's own differing agendas. Through it all, a bond forms between the two, and what will happen at journey's end becomes anyone's guess.
It is the darkest of times in China, when ruthless warlords wage battles to satiate their endless aggression. Millions of lives have perished, and those who have survived have only two choices kill or to be killed.The battalions of warring states Liang and Wei collide in a bloodbath that last from dawn until dusk. Only two men are left standing a foot soldier from Liang and the rival General from Wei. The Soldier survives because he is an expert in playing dead, with a device strapped on his body which protrudes like an arrowhead for added realism.The Soldier captures the wounded General, hoping to use the enemy as his ticket to freedom by handing the General to the Liang warlord, the Soldier could be honorably discharged and return home to his peaceful life. The young General, though taken captive, is condescending towards the Soldier. The two men are to be often at loggerheads during the long and winding journey.
