42nd Montreal's World Film Festival Awards "Best Actor": Hiroshi Tachi in LIFE IN OVERTIME / OWATTA HITO by Hideo Nakata, Japan.
Sosuke Tashiro is on an elite career course at a major bank until he is transferred - or rather relegated - to a subsidiary company, where he reaches retirement age. After decades of single-minded dedication to his work, he finds himself at a loss. Days pass with nothing for him to do, and time goes by at a snail's pace. "I don't want my life to end like this." Sosuke picks up the courage to look for work at a nearby job center, but his glittering academic background and impressive resume get in the way, and he has little luck. Upon seeing this, his wife Chigusa who works as a hairdresser and his daughter jokingly suggest that Sousuke should find someone to date. Coincidentally, Sousuke indeed finds someone who he is interested but things do not turn out the way he wants and his life starts to take on an uncontrollable twist.
