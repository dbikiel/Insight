A crisis counselor is sent by the Catholic Church to a small Chilean beach town where disgraced Priests and nuns, suspected of crimes ranging from child abuse to baby-snatching from unwed mothers, live secluded, after an incident occurs.
Four Catholic Priests, now excommunicated, share a secluded house in a small coastal house of Chile, where they are are supposed to atone for their sins. Their quiet routine, placed under the supervision of Mother MÃ³nica (Antonia Zegers), is disturbed by the coming of a fifth man. The newcomer, a pedophile, appears as a most unwelcome reminder of their own tainted lives.
