A reclusive scientist builds a robot which looks exactly like Dr. Ulysses, a scientist set to go on a long-term space mission. Since the (real) scientist seems to lack all emotions, he is unable to program his (lack of) emotion into his automaton, and an eccentric woman is hired to "educate" the robot on human behavior. In the end, she falls in love - but is it the robot or Mr. Right?
After building a cybernetic replica of a space-bound scientist in his own image, emotionless Dr Ulysses hires a beautiful, perky P.R. woman named Frankie to teach his robot about human behavior. Then the unimaginable happens and the (robot) Ulysses, falls in love with Frankie. She's confused about love herself, and denies that Ulysses can have feelings for her.
Top P.R. consultant Frankie Stone is hired to promote Ulysses, the world's first automaton astronaut. As she spends more and more time with the creation, Frankie finds herself drawn towards Ulysses' sweet character and gentle temperament, and although she is permitted to teach Ulysses only what is vital to his approaching space mission, the robot quickly learns emotions, and it isn't long before he is madly in love with her. Much to the alarm of his identical creator, the dispassionate Dr. Jeff Peters. But where do Frankie's feelings truly lie?
