Two immature detectives are joined by a pesky assistant district attorney in staking out a lakeside home where a Mafia trial witness is believed to be heading.
Chris and Bill are called upon for their excellent surveillance record to stakeout a lakeside home where a Mafia trial witness is believed to be heading or already hiding. Unlike their earlier _Stakeout_, this time they are accompanied by Gina Garret from the DA's office and her pet rottweiler 'Archie'; their cover, husband and wife with son Bill.
A witness against the Mafia is being secretly held till the trial when a violent attempt against her is made that kills several of her guards. She disappears and Bill and Chris are sent to another stakeout. This one is arranged by the D.A.'s office and comes with Gina (and her pet Rottweiler) who is to keep an eye on them since the observation post is a vacation resort community in the home of a judge. Bill and Chris are annoyed and are every bit as childish as before.
When a woman who's suppose testify against the mob is placed in protective custody. However a mob hit man finds the safe house and blows it up. The woman's body is not found. Now the D.A. tries to find her so he ask the cops to keep an eye on all the places she could go. And one of these places is in Seattle so Detectives Chris Lecce and Bill Reimers are sent to cover the place and accompanying them is A.D.A. Gina Garrett. And the three of them pretend to be a family.
