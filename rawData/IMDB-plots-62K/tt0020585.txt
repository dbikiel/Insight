A flapper with a dubious reputation enjoys a vivacious night of dancing and finds herself romantically linked to her boss.
A young shop girl is dance mad, even winning prize cups in competitions. Circulating with lots of people gives her a dubious reputation, but we see it's unwarranted. The son of the owner of the department store she works in falls for her without realizing her status. at length, he puts her to a test to see just what kind of girl she is.
The film begins with Peabody Jr. (Neil Hamilton) and friends preparing to frolic into the night before Jr. must begin work the following day at his father's department store. Before departing, Peabody Sr. (Edward Martindale) lectures his son about the women of the day and that all the cuties at the store are off limits.
In the meantime, Pert Kelly (Colleen Moore), after winning a dance contest is being wooed by gentlemen of questionable character. All parties end up having a wild time at "The Boiler" where Pert catches the eye of Peabody Jr. who gives her a ride home and schedules a date for the following night. Pert is tardy to work as she was up until 3 and must report to the personnel office where she is surprised to find Peabody Jr. working. Peabody Sr. is there, figures out what's going on, and terminates Pert's employment.
Peabody Jr. must wait several hours past the scheduled date before he can talk to Pert and explain he did not do the firing. They schedule another date.
Lavish gifts arrive for Pert to wear to the next date. She gets lectured by Pa Kelly (John St. Polis) about the lack of virtues of the "modern" man. Similarly Peabody Jr. is again lectured about the "modern" woman by Peabody Sr.
On the next date, Junior arranges a test of Pert's virtue which she passes with ease and they arrive back home to prove her virtue to Senior who now cannot refute it.
