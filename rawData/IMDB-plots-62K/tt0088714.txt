A bank robber tries to return his girl, but crazy way of life coupled with insane company make the case only worse.
After the successful bank robbery Micky hopes to take back his girlfriend Mary who has been taken from him by the brothers Venin. On the way to Paris he meets one Leon, a neurotic and dreamer, whom he and his associates consider an idiot. Leon can hardly understand what Micky is up to but he follows him everywhere and soon falls in love with Mary. This strange love triangle resolves in a tragic ending. Strange it may seem but the credits tell us that "The film is inspired by Dostoyevsky's "The Idiot" and intended as a homage to the great writer".
