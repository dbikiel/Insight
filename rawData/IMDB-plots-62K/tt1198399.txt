A short film in which Quran verses are shown alongside images from terrorist attacks.
Fitna is a 16 minute long film by Dutch politician Geert Wilders, leader of the Party for Freedom in the Dutch parliament. The name comes from the Arabic word fitna which is used to describe "disagreement and division among people", or a "test of faith in times of trial". The movie offers a critical view of Islam and the Koran. Interspersed with extremely violent verses of the Koran, it shows graphic views of terrorist violence, and also unexplained disturbing images of children with bloody heads (associated with some Shiite observances of the Day of Ashura), and images meant to conjure up concerns about female circumcision. No attempt is made to contextualize these issues, or suggest that there might be Muslims who are not in full support of these actions or verses of the Koran which might provide a different balance. Instead there are bar graphs showing the explosive growth of the Muslim population in the Netherlands and in Europe, and a clear insinuation that unless something is done to stop them, Muslims will soon take over and destroy the freedoms the Dutch people cherish. The final call in the movie is to "Stop Islamisation" and "Defend our freedoms."
