Theta Pi Gamma fraternity's newest pledge--a gawky, innocent, and utterly uncool bookworm--and two of his self-confident fraternity brothers embark on a week-long vacation in Palm Springs. Can they transform him into a real Casanova?
A nerd gains the friendship of two of his frat brothers when his dad offers them his condo for the week in Palm Springs, and also offers the fraternity a hot tub and jacuzzi if they can help his son find a girl. They meet two guys from a rival fraternity, and make a bet on who can nail the Designated Babe first.
Gawky, innocent, and utterly uncool, Wendell Tvedt--Theta Pi Gamma fraternity's newest pledge--is a proper bookworm and a late bloomer. In the hope of getting lucky, Wendell's self-confident fraternity brothers, Mother and Joe, agree to accompany him on a week-long vacation to his parents' beach-side house in Palm Springs, where the action is. Will the boys show Wendell the ropes to transform him into a real Casanova?
