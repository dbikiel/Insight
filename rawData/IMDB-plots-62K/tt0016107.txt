A corrupt art patron finds himself in love with the same girl as his stepson.
Wealthy arts impresario Nicholas Harmon tires of his aging operatic star Nina, who is also his lover. Harmon's son Don dislikes the way Nina disparages his late mother, and rejects his father and his money when the senior Harmon refuses to rebuke her. Don leaves his father's house and takes a job as a nightclub musical conductor. He meets a Russian refugee girl, Anna, who has a beautiful singing voice, and falls in love with her,. When Nicholas Harmon happens to visit the nightclub and hears and sees Anna, he decides she will be his next star -- and his next lover. Father and son are thus pitted each against the other for Anna's favors.
