On his way to Red Mesa to insure mine owners against loss from raids on their ore shipments, George O'Brien is ambushed by the raiders, and is accidentally saved by the Three Stooges who run a traveling variety store. O'Brien sells mine owner John Sawyer and his foreman Sandy Evans on allowing him to insure and guard their shipments since they have no help from the bumbling sheriff. He hires to Stooges, Laura Mason and Doc Mason, Laura's ex-physician-turned-drunk grandfather. O'Brien's first move is to trap the bandits headed by saloon owner Taggart and his henchman Clete by using the Stooges to inform Taggart that O'Brien will escort the gold shipment, but George plans on having the Stooges take the actual shipment in another wagon. His plans backfire when Doc Mason, drunk in Taggart's saloon, accidentally informs Taggart of the real plans.
