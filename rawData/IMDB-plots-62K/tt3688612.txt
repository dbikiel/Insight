The police killing of Mark Duggan in London, 2011, ignited the worst civil unrest in recent British history and made headlines around the globe.
A documentary that reflects on the 2011 killing of Mark Duggan, a young, black, British man, at the hands of London's Metropolitan Police. Duggan was pulled over by police early one morning, and minutes later, was shot dead. This event sparked the now-infamous Tottenham riots and made headlines around the globe, but, as so often happens, the issue soon dropped from the news reports. Picking up the story where the media left off, George Amponsah's documentary The Hard Stop brings it back to its roots in Duggan's neighbourhood, following his friends Marcus and Kurtis as they fight for justice and search for meaning, while struggling against ongoing discrimination in their daily lives.
Over serval years The Hard Stop features Marcus and Kurtis, childhood friends of Mark Duggan the young man whose death ignited the UK riots in 2011. Marcus was sentenced for starting the riot in Tottenham that turn into the worst civil unrest in recent British History. The film reflects the current class divisions in British society as it charts the everyday challenges Marcus and Kurtis face as they grieve the loss of their dear friend, and negotiate incarceration and unemployment whilst the media debate about who their friend Mark Duggan was and the inquest into his killing plays out in the background.
