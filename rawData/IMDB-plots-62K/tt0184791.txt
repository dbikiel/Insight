An update of Shakespeare's 'Othello' with a young cast, set in an upper class prep school, &amp; centered around basketball player Odin.
Tough Coach Duke Goulding leaves nothing untried to lead his almost exclusively white boarding school basketball team, the Hawks, to victory after victory, but his own son Hugo feels his polyvalent technical excellence and tireless efforts -which require using stimulants- are not getting anything like the recognition he deserves, especially when coach gives the best player award to Odin James, the only black teammate, even saying he loves Odin like his own son, who in turn only calls super-rich Michael Cassio to share in the honor. So Hugo, who is liked by everyone, decides to set up the boys who stole his glory, and he knows a cocky adolescent's weak points are his pride and his girl. This Dixie Jago schemes to bring down a black Othello and his Cassio, playing into the poisonous power of jealousy, however badly this also hurts their loved ones and the whole team...
In this modern version of Shakespeare's 'Othello', Odin James is the black star of the basketball team at an otherwise white boarding school. He is headed for big time with his sport and is in love with Desi, the most popular girl in school. Meanwhile, Hugo is the coach's son, but he is outshone on court by Odin, and his father says he thinks of Odin as a son as well. Hugo's feelings of envy and neglect lead him to construct a plot to make Odin doubt Desi's love for him, a plot which Hugo is willing to take to its most extreme consequences.
