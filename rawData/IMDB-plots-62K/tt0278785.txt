This film finds a mother and her teen daughter both being diagnosed with cancer. This discovery helps to overcome the longtime antagonistic relationship that the two have developed.
Robert Portman lost his job, so he can't afford sufficient alimony for his ex, caterer Julie, and their adolescent kids, model student Michael and spoiled screwup Emma. The family pulls together when Emma is diagnosed with life-threatening cancer. Cultured fisherman George Tomich offers Julie true romance, but she gives priority to Emma and refuses to burden him when she's diagnosed with breast cancer herself, which she keeps secret by postponing her treatment until Emma has celebrated her graduation.
