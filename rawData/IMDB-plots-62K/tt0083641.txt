When a professional couple who have lived &amp; worked together for many years finally decide to marry, their sudden betrothal causes many unexpectedly funny and awkward difficulties. They soon find that being married is often quite different from being "best friends."
Richard Babson and Paula McCullen are successful Hollywood screenwriting partners, best friends, roommates and lovers. They decide to take the next step in their relationship by buying a house together. Because of the symbolism of the house purchase, Richard is able to convince an initially reluctant Paula to get married, her reluctance due to it meaning that she has to be a grown-up in life, just one of her many neuroses. In agreeing to get married, Paula in turn is able to convince Richard to take a cross-country train trip first to visit her parents in Buffalo, New York for a week to help celebrate their fortieth anniversary, then to Vienna, Virginia to visit his parents for a few days, Paula and Richard who have yet to meet their respective in-laws. Beyond the pressures they face from their producer Larry Weisman concerning their latest screenplay, Richard and Paula may not be able to survive not only as a married couple but as a partnership in all its aspects on this trip, as each not only can see into the future of their spouse by his/her parents, but the state of marriages in all their facets the longer they progress. The situation is exacerbated by their marriage being placed under a microscope by those around them.
