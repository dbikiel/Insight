Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie get together to talk about their early lives, their highly successful comedy partnership, and Marjorie.
In every comedy generation, Britain has produced quality double act after quality double act. Peter Cooke and Dudley Moore, the Two Ronnies, French and Saunders... the list goes on. Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie are now known as two of the world's most popular figures in entertainment, enjoying solo success (in Stephen's case) writing, performing and broadcasting, and (in Hugh's case) award-winning US drama. But it's easy for a new generation of comedy fans to forget that at the start of their careers they worked together as one of the nation's most popular comedy double acts. This UK premiere celebrates the 30th anniversary of the pair working together. Back in 1980, Fry and Laurie met for the first time at Cambridge University, introduced by their mutual friend Emma Thompson, and quickly became the torchbearers for the established Footlights comedy and performing troupe. They were the perfect combination - Stephen was tall, awkward and an expert straight man, while Hugh was a physical comedy whirlwind. They found themselves at the forefront of the new alternative comedy movement in the early 1980s and reaped the benefits, finding fertile ground in which to showcase their talents - they won the inaugural Perrier Award at the Edinburgh festival in 1981, they frequently appeared in the ground breaking Saturday Night Live, they starred together in Blackadder, and their own series, A Bit Of Fry And Laurie, ran from 1989 to 1995. Now, in Fry And Laurie Reunited, the pair talk exclusively about their friendship, their personalities and talk through some of their favourite sketches. With plenty of clips and rare material, this is the ultimate celebration of two of Britain's favourite sons.
