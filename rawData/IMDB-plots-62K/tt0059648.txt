A veteran US Secret Service agent must thwart the covert conspiracy of an enemy spy network that threatens the world's safety.
In 1960s Morocco, an international crime syndicate is hired to eliminate Western secret agents. When a U.S. agent is killed by the syndicate, the U.S. government decides to send-in a freelance mercenary agent named Jimmy Merrill. The government doesn't know who's running the syndicate but a certain Oscar Rubeck is on their radar. Rubeck is a former Nazi intelligence officer who disappeared after WW2 and surfaced later, during the Cold War, as an assassin-for-hire. The U.S. government fears that Communist interests hired Rubeck to eliminate all Western agents in Morocco, thus paving the way for a Communist takeover. Freelance agent Jimmy Merrill arrives in Morocco, under the code-name Bingo, and he's instructed to work with two Norwegian intelligence officers, Erik and Edith. Merrill's task is to locate and capture Rubeck, interrogate him and hand him over to the Norwegians who want Rubeck in Oslo. The Norwegian government suspects that Rubeck is responsible for the 1956 bombing of a U.N. airplane that was carrying the Norwegian mediators to the peace negotiations regarding the Suez Crisis. However, finding and capturing Oscar Rubeck is no easy task. His crime syndicate is well trained, financed and prepared to deal with its enemies. The most dangerous of all is Rubeck's trusted henchman Alexej who was found and adopted as a young boy by Rubeck during the war in Poland. As a former Nazi intelligence officer, Rubeck taught Alexej the trade-craft of being a spy and a killer. Jimmy Merrill and his Norwegian allies are fighting against the odds.
