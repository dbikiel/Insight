A retired mob accountant is drawn back in when his brothers, who have recently made a hit for the organization, decide to go to the authorities.
Eddie Rico has been the book-keeper of an important Mafia boss but now he is an honest merchant and lives with his family in Florida. Everything changes when the police starts to search for his brothers. Now Eddie sees himself forced to get in touch with the Mafia again.
Eddie Rico, a former accountant for crime-boss Sid Kubic, has gone straight, with the blessings of Kubic who owed his life to Rico's mother when she stopped a bullet meant for him. Eddie and his wife, Alice, are looking to adopt a baby when Eddie learns that the syndicate is looking for his brother, so they can get him out of the country before the police can find and question him. Eddie finds him, but the mobsters double-cross him and kill his brother just as they had killed another brother of Eddie's. Eddie decides to go to the police but Kubic puts out the word to get him also.
