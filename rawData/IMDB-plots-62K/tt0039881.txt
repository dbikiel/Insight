Two US Treasury agents hunt a successful counterfeiting ring.
United States Treasury agents O'Brien and Genaro infiltrate a counterfeiting ring which has some dangerously good paper. This is supposedly based on several actual Treasury cases.
When the American Treasure Department finds that a gang in Los Angeles is making false currency, agents Dennis O'Brien and Tony Genaro are assigned to investigate the counterfeit gang using the identities of Vannie Harrigan and Tony Galvani in Detroit. Along their investigation they join the gang of mobsters trying to discover who the boss behind the scheme is.
A flood of counterfeit money is flowing into general use and the United States Treasury Department is reeling. The illegal tender has an unusually high quality due to the expert engraving of the plates, and very good paper used for making the funny money nearly indistinguishable from the real thing. The Treasury Department calls in Dennis O'Brien (Dennis O'Keefe) to go undercover and infiltrate a ruthless Detroit gang believed to be responsible for the fake dough. O'Brien partners up with the newly married Anthony Gennaro (Alfred Ryder) and the two gain access to the thugs making the bad money. O'Brien tracks down one of the main players named Schemer (Wallace Ford) and further discovers the top boss who is bringing paper in from Asia and making the excellent counterfeit money. When Gennaro's true identity is discovered by the counterfeiting crooks O'Brien must make a tough decision to continue his assignment to bring down the criminals who will stop at nothing to continue their illicit activities. As O'Brien manages to get all the culprits together for a bust he realizes his cover is blown and he races against the clock to bring the bad guys to justice and stay alive.
