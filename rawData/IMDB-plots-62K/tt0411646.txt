Michael Wilson, like the subject of his film, is trying to get an interview with a multi-millionaire; however, in this case, that millionaire is Michael Moore himself.
Michael Moore Hates America is a documentary that forces audiences to rethink the genre. It challenges conventional wisdom and takes on the top documentary filmmaker of all time. Join Mike Wilson as he travels from coast to coast in search of the American Dream, and chases down Michael Moore in an effort to figure out why the two have such different visions of America.
Believing that popular documentary filmmaker Michael Moore has presented a very skewed and overly negative portrait of America, Mike Wilson sets out to find people who have found great success in America despite their humble beginnings. He also tries to get an interview with Moore and ironically finds the experience very similar to Moore's attempts to get an interview with Roger Smith in Roger &amp; Me.
