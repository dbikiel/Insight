Italian-American mafioso Carmine Ganucci evicts Miss Poole and her school of etiquette from the commercial building he has just purchased, the space which he wants for one of his own illicit businesses, and despite Miss Poole having a long term lease. An incensed Miss Poole senses an opportunity when, going to confront Ganucci about the situation, he mistakes her as an applicant for nanny, he requiring such a caregiver for his son Lewis as he and his wife head to Italy for an extended trip, leaving Lewis at home with said caregiver. In her new position as nanny, Miss Poole plans to exact revenge and get what she feels is appropriate monetary compensation - $50,000 - by masterminding a plot to kidnap Lewis, her accompanist Luther who she will co-opt as that actual kidnapper without telling him that it is Ganucci's son they are kidnapping. Complications and misunderstandings ensue when nanny deals with one of Ganucci's low level flunkies, Benny Napkins, to have the $50,000 ransom paid without letting Ganucci find out about the situation, as Ganucci himself works on another $50,000 deal, and as Luther's wife Ida starts to fall in love with the idea of a Lewis in her life.
