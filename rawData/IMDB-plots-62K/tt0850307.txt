Two friends a concession stand at the foot of the Statue of Liberty. After the World Trade Center terrorist attack, each of their dreams go up in smoke and yet they must endure the effect the attacks has on their lives.
In Ilya Chaikin's LIBERTY KID, childhood friends Derrick (Al Thompson) and Tico (Kareem SaviÃ±on) occupy a high school dropout limbo operating a concession stand at the foot of the Statue of Liberty. Tico's ambitions reach no further than collecting the next paycheck or pretty girl's phone number, while Derrick has his eyes on a different prize. But when the World Trade Center terrorist attack plunges their lives, their community, and their country into chaos, Derrick's vision of a college-educated future goes up in smoke in the first of many incidences of personal collateral damage both he and Tico must endure.
