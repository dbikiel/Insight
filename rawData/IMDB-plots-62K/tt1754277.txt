An apparently happy family man must reveal a lifelong secret - that he is gay.
In this intimate drama, Kawariki must become the leader of the family after his father retires. A husband and father, he realizes that in order to lead with integrity, he must come out and be honest about his own life, even though it will test the boundaries of acceptance and unconditional love. Offering valuable insights into Maori traditions, family ideals and cultural values, this feature debut is rich and textured with emotional layers and stunning New Zealand landscapes.
With his father's retirement, Kawa will become head of his clan, so to speak. He's been groomed for this since he was twelve but has kept secret his homosexuality all the while. Now grown into a successful and respected businessman, a husband, and a father of two, he's finding it ever harder to stay closeted. Knowing the exposed truth will hurt him and those he loves, he also knows it'll hurt more the longer he stays quiet (including a boyfriend kept on the sly who's fallen hard for him).
