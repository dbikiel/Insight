A young woman, Marie, in her early twenties (played by Maya Berthoud), relives her past while wiling away her time as a maid in a small town hotel. She tells a true story of how she betrayed her first love, and then proceeds to convince a middle-aged man Steve (played by Stephen W. Gillard) to desert his wife and kids and take her on a fling to Thailand. Stephen's real-life wife Sue and daughter Jessica add their real-life stories, about early pregnancy and first love respectively. Even an itinerant street musician (Robert Rutledge) sings about love, telling his true tale of falling in love with his best friend. His ultimate mistake, he explains; seducing her sister. In the end the message is clear. Above all, avoid betraying yourself.
