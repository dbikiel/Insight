Romeo &amp; Juliet gets transplanted to the Bronx.
The Capomezzo's and the Malacici's are Italian-American families who are also rivals in the catering and restaurant business. Things come to a head when the Capomezzo's son and the Malacici's daughter get thrown together for the leads in a Romeo &amp; Juliet community play. As the parents continue butting heads, the children fall in love and hilarity ensues.
