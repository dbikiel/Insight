A naive elderly British rural couple survive the initial onslaught of a nuclear war.
With the help of government-issued pamphlets, an elderly British couple build a shelter and prepare for an impending nuclear attack, unaware that times and the nature of war have changed from their romantic memories of World War II.
Jim (Sir John Mills) and Hilda Bloggs (Dame Peggy Ashcroft), a middle-class couple whose children have all grown up. Their house is hit indirectly by a Soviet nuclear bomb, leaving it in ashes and barely standing. Jim and Hilda survive by ducking behind a door that Jim set up as an inner refuge.
Jim (Sir John Mills) and Hilda (Dame Peggy Ashcroft) are two English retirees, living in a cottage in the country. War with Russia seems imminent, and Jim starts taking precautions against a nuclear attack. Remembering World War II, Jim and Hilda staunchly believe that everything will be okay, even if nuclear weapons are involved. But will it?
Based on Raymond Briggs' book. An old British couple, Jim (Sir John Mills) and Hilda (Dame Peggy Ashcroft), who live in the countryside, believe in the fact that the Government will always know what it is doing. However, the world is fast heading for World War III between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Jim prepares for it by building a shelter using Goverment pamphlets. However, both of them still believe that the war will be fought like World War II, and they can't fully understand that the war will be fought with nuclear weapons. All too soon, war breaks out and Jim and Hilda survive a nuclear blast.
