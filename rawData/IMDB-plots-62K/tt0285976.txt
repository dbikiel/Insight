Reality television goes beyond the limit when people start dying.
Four young women and three young men, totally strangers to each other, are sent to an isolated house with the crew members of a reality show to stay living together for three months without any means of communication with the exterior, and in the end, the winner will get a prize of US$ 100,000.00. When the cameraman is found dead in a barn, the group becomes hysterical, since nobody knows who is trustful.
