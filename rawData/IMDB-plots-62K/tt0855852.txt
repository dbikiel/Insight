Based on childhood days of Teruyo Nogami.
Depicting the period in and around World War II in Japan, 'Our Mother' depicts the madness and inhumanity of what happens when a right-wing militaristic government takes over and drives a nation to annihilation. The tragedy not only strikes a nation as a whole, but comes to the doorsteps of a woman who is left alone and desperate with everyone for whom she cares and knows victimized by conservatism, jingoism, nationalism and arrogance. There is no respite.
