A drunken, boorish general tyrannizes his wife and his maid. When the wife discovers that the maid is pregnant with the general's child, she turns the maid out of the house. Years later, the general is dead, and a younger generation has risen with a new outlook on life and new problems to face. This flamboyantly stylized melodrama, loosely adapted from Ibsen, comes from one of the legendary figures of the Iranian New Wave.
