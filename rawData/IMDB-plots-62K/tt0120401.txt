A female psychologist wants to understand the minds of a confessed serial killer who spent the last five years in a mental hospital because of his state.
Simon is a confessed serial killer who spent the last five years in a mental hospital because of his state. Dr.Karen Shoemaker wants to get through to him and starts visiting him in the hospital, and his previous life comes to us in flashbacks.
Simon is a killer. Unfit to stand trial. He has been locked away for five years, watched by the sinister Dr Marlowe. Enter Karen, an enthusiastic but formidably intelligent psychologist. She will interview Simon - who wants to prove that he is cured. He seems sane. Seemingly incapable of ferocious acts of violence. He tells her of a terrifying force within him, which drives him to destroy those around him. He says this force has gone. Karen listens to his story. At first she trusts him, even believes him. But then her trust gives way to scepticism. His confession is replaced by deception. The interview unleashes demons from Simon's strange internal world - threatening Karen's previously stable sense of reality. She wants the truth. But she finds that truth can be the most terrifying thing of all.
The successful psychologist Dr. Karen Schumaker comes to a mental institution directed by Dr. Marlowe to evaluate the dyslexic serial-killer Simon "The Ugly" Cartwright. Simon discloses the sad story of his life, bullied at school and abused by his mother Evelyn Cartwright. His only friend Julie was separated from him by his mother when he was a teenager. Simon claims that he hears voices that force him to kill. When Dr. Schumaker earns his trust, she discovers what is going inside Simon's head.
