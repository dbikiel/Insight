Silvio is sixteen and is more interested in girls than politics. When his high school is occupy by students, he takes the chance to find his soulmate. He and his friend Ponzi experience the anxiety of love and sex. The occupation is shut down by the police. After a first deception, Silvio will find his first love almost by chance.
Silvio (Silvio Muccino, the director's younger brother) has no interest in the student rebellion taking place at his high school. His fascination lies with Valentina (Giulia Carmignani), the prettiest girl in the school. However, Valentina already has a jealous boyfriend, Martino (Simone Pagani). After Silvio finally has a moment alone with Valentina (where they share a kiss), he makes the mistake of telling his gossipy best friend, Ponzi (Giuseppe Sanfelice). By the end of the day the entire school knows about the kiss, including a very angry Martino and Claudia (Giulia Steigerwalt), a young classmate who has a big crush on Silvio. As things grow more complicated for him at school, Silvio finds no relief at home with his ex-revolutionary parents (Anna Galiena and Luca De Flippo), his love-starved brother (Enrico Silvestrin), and his secretive sister (Giulia Ciccone). In the end, this farce of confused intentions finds Silvio with a new object of affection, one girl he had regarded simply as a friend but who, in fact, turns out to be much more.
