The gang is befriended by a millionaire whom they save from a mugging. However, they begin to suspect that the man's son was actually one of the muggers. Knowing that the boy's father is still grieving for an older son he lost during the war, and would be devastated if he learned his only remaining son was a criminal, the gang sets out to reform the boy.
