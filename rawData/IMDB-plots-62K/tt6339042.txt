A new teaching system arrives at the hall and the boys hate it and and try to get rid of it in secret. Bruno's plans never turn out the way they planned so guess who had another plan. The system only holds double digits so once you reach a certain amount something happens. The boys can't figure it out until later in the movie but Bruno finds out what happens.
