A troubled and solitary woman who suffers from an acute light sensitivity summons the strength to escape her persistent trials; however, the fateful morning which is only hours away, still seems so distant and pale. Can she take the step?
It's night. Perhaps after a dream of an intruder crashing through a window, a woman who's sensitive to light has a telephone conversation with a friend. The woman has a plane ticket from Copenhagen to Buenos Aires at 6 that morning. She doesn't want to go. Her friend encourages her to make the trip. Later, she stands in a car park with her suitcase. Flying geese fill the screen.
Condemned to a cruel life of shadows and darkness as a result of an unknown degenerative disease, a solitary woman who suffers from an acute light sensitivity is awakened once more in the dead of night by a sweaty and razor-sharp nightmare. Defeated and unable to cope with this unbearable situation, she summons the strength to flee to Buenos Aires--the flight ticket in her hands is her last chance to escape her persistent trials--however, the fateful morning which is only hours away, still seems so distant and pale. Can the troubled woman take the step?
