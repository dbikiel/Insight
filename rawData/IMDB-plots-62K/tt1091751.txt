The true story of Jasmine Plummer who, at the age of eleven, became the first female to play in Pop Warner football tournament in its 56-year history.
Based on a true story, Curtis Plummer (Ice Cube) is a down-on-his-luck former high school football star that turns his niece, Jasmine (Keke Palmer), into the quarterback of the local team, the Minden Browns. He gets his stride back when he becomes the team's coach after the current coach (Matt Craven) becomes ill. With Curtis as their new leader and their pigtail-wearing star player at QB, this team of misfits wins its way to the Pop Warner Super Bowl and the small city of Minden, Illinois is ignited with team spirit, town pride and glory. Becoming the first female to lead her team to the Pop Warner Super Bowl does not come without conflict. Along with the struggles of being accepted by her all male teamates, her deadbeat father re-appears when he sees his daughter starting to appear on the local &amp; national news. She struggles with wanting her father to be a part of her life, but will soon find out that her uncle is the one who truly cares about her and is committed to being there when she most needs a father figure and best friend. She not only looks up to her uncle, but honors him by wearing his old jersey number, #11.
