An orphan bear cub hooks up with an adult male as they try to dodge human hunters.
The director of La guerre du feu (1981) creates yet another film in nature with almost no human dialogue in this picturesque story of an orphaned bear cub who is adopted by an adult male bear and must avoid hunters. Bart the Bear stars in this anthropomorphic fantasy.
