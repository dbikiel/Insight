Filmed like a theatrical cartoon strip and in satirical style, the film describes several miracles of Sant Vicent Ferrer, a Christian ecclesiastical of the fourteenth century and patron saint of the Valencian Country, represented with a demystifying intention as a monk who fights against all kinds of vices and sins. Some of these miracles are the ability to sprout water from a rock, the reconstruction and resurfacing of a boy cut into pieces and served on a stew in the same sanctuary, and the order to expel sixty demons from the ass of a possessed woman, which causes a strong explosion. At the end of each prodigy, a laudatory note can be heard dedicated to the protagonist, which gives way to the next miracle.
