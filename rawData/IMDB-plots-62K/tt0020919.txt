A brash, pushy young man gets a job in a bank and sets his cap for his boss's secretary, but the death of his father makes him reassess his priorities.
Tom Ward is just back from College and the only thing that he seemed to learn is how to be obnoxious and loud. He forgoes a bank job to work at Sutton and Company just to make time with Mary, McAndrews' fianc√©e. Mary warms to Tom, but his work is such that his job is history. After losing his father, it is up to Tom to support and care for his family. His attitude towards work changes, but not his attitude towards Mary.
Tom Ward, a loud, overbearing, rude, offensive, obnoxious, boastful, smart-aleck jerk, is a football hero who gets a job in a bank after he graduates. On his first day, he basically fires everybody but the boss, and asks the bosses secretary to marry him a few minutes after they meet...and every few minutes after that. He loses his job, old Dad dies, and he becomes the sole support of his family. This calls for an attitude-adjustment.
