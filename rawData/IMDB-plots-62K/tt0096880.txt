A group of fishermen on a precariously balanced platform fight over a trunk.
The setting is on a floating platform where a group of evenly and carefully placed men live. Each man is aware that the platform is not stable and in order not to fall to their deaths, they maintain a careful balance of weight to prevent the platform from tipping too far and cause them all to fall. This reasonably harmonious understanding is lost when one man pulls up a heavy trunk. In the ensuing struggle, balance is lost in more than one sense.
Afloat in space, an unstable platform which pivots around an imaginary central axis carries a uniformly attired group of five fishermen. However, the surface is extremely susceptible to movement; if one of the men moves a muscle, the whole floor will tilt, requiring a gentle handling and a movement in unison to stay in balance. Under those circumstances, when a mysterious chest is retrieved from the unfathomable void that encircles them, inevitably, the fine equilibrium that sustains the team in life will be disrupted, and other, more powerful and primitive feelings will emerge. Who shall prevail?
