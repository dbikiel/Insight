25 years old Hippo doesn't have a job, doesn't study either but lives from the money his younger brother earns with dealing and from occasional Poker winnings -- he's a representative of a disillusioned generation, doesn't care what other people think of him. But of all people he falls in love with the ambitioned student Nathalie and soon finds himself forced to think about taking a job.
