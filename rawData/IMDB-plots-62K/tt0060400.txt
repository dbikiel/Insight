Famous but unlucky pursuers of Fantomas from France go to weird Scotland for a final attempt to bring the impudent criminal to justice.
Fantomas wants to collect money from scottish rich' for letting them live. The French inspector (Louis de Funes) comes to a scottish castle to protect the owner, and to catch Fantomas. There is a lot of funny trouble in the castle, espacially at one big evening party.
