In a world of odd people and surreal habits, the Queen weeps and wails: her daughter Betty won't wake up. With the court looking on, the King swings into action, jiggling the bed with the help of a knight, calling on a doctor and then a witch, and also phoning for a prince. As the prince, on his steed, makes his way to Betty's bedside - a trip replete with adventures - we watch others try to wake the young woman. On-lookers include a jester, Henry VIII, Queen Victoria, and a multi-eyed gargoyle. Will the prince make everything right? Where are we?
