Rodeo-cum-prison movie about an ageing rodeo star bonding with a young rookie while they both serve time
Being drunk, a young guy Clay Treyton had a fight with the police, and as a result ended up in jail. He is sent to a prison ranch, where Clay asks to get him a job with horses. There, his immediate boss is a senior cowboy named Ry Weston, who is in conflict with a criminal who supplies drugs to the ranch. Weston forbade the use of the ranch as a transit base for his drug trafficking, and now the life of a brave cowboy is constantly at risk.
