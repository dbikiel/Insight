A collection of oddball "home movies".
A collection of over 100 amateurish, bizarre, and occasionally naughty short subjects. Each lasts only a few seconds, and almost all star Len Cella, presumably the 'Moron' of the title. Includes: "Jello Makes a Lousy Doorstop", "The Shy Bra Salesman", "Another Use for Tough Meat", "An Exercise to Prevent Fat Ears", "Schitt for President", "The Perverted Cameraman", "Dreaded Wheat", "Worms Going to the Movies", "The Truck Wrestler", "Walking a Pet Two By Four", "Punishing a Camera for Shooting Bad Photos", "Hitler In First Grade", "Another Use for a Bad President", "Animals Should Wear Underwear", "Ghetto Divorce Court", and many more.
