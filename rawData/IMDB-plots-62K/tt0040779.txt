A wife convinces her husband to fake his death so they can collect on the life insurance. However, he doesn't know that she has been having an affair for some time, and she has plans for the money - and they don't include him.
Edna Grover convinces her husband, Sam, to enter a scheme where they can defraud his insurance company out of $50,000, so they can live in luxury. Sam forgets to ask Edna who 'they' is. Edna's definition of 'they' is herself and her lover, Ray Belden. There is a hotel fire, and Edna identifies the body in the fire as her husband Sam. Meanwhile, Sam flees to another city under an assumed name, where he waits for his loving-spouse to join him and they can live a life of luxury. He waits. And waits some more. And returns to ask Edna just what the delay is, and learns that the delay is another man. Before long, there is another dead man, and then a blackmailing private detective shows up, and then a police detective starts nosing around, and Sam still hasn't seen any money nor a life of luxury.
