A woman goes to prison for murder. After being released back into society, she tries to create a new life for her and her now nine year old daughter. But her dark past comes back to haunt her and threaten both of their lives.
After serving 10 years in prison for murder, Jenny returns to society. She dreams of living a quiet life and of resuming her responsibilities as a mother, but soon dark shadows from the past start to appear. "It's Only Make Believe" is the story of a murder that never should have happened, of friends that never should have been trusted, and a debt that keeps on increasing for every down payment. Although Jenny has lost everything, she still has everything to win: her daughter. "It's Only Make Believe" is an exciting thriller and a heartfelt drama that marks a return to energetic and passionate filmmaking for Norwegian maverick director Arild Ã˜stin Ommundsen.
