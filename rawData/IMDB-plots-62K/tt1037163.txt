An examination of the creation of the state of Israel in 1948 through to the present day.
"THE TIME THAT REMAINS is a semi-biographical film, in four episodes, about a family, my family, from 1948 until recent times. The film is inspired by my father's private diaries, starting from when he was a resistance fighter in 1948, and by my mother's letters to family members who were forced to leave the country since that time. Combined with my intimate memories of them and with them, the film attempts to portray the daily life of those Palestinians who remained and were labeled 'Israeli-Arabs', living as a minority in their own homeland." - Elia Suleiman
