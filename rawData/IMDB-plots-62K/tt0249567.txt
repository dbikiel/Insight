This is Tim Burton's Disney Channel Halloween film short that only aired once. It combines live action and stop-motion, making for a creepy adventure into the woods.
Tim Burton's "Hansel and Gretel" is a live-action and stop-motion animated film short featuring East Asian actors and striking set designs reminiscent of his later work in films such as "Beetle Juice" and "Edward Scissorhands". While this film was created during Tim Burton's employment at Disney Feature Animation, his stop-motion work began with the short film "Vincent" and continues today with the recent "Tim Burton's The Corpse Bride". His 2D animation work while with Disney included "The Fox and the Hound" and "The Black Cauldron".
