The movie depicts the political crisis that led to the suicide of president Getúlio Vargas, in the 19 days that preceded August 24, 1954. The crisis began with the attempted assassination of journalist and politician Carlos Lacerda (Alexandre Borges) in August 5, 1954, at rua Toneleros, Rio de Janeiro, in which Major Vaz was assassinated instead. Investigations pointed to Gregório Fortunato (Thiago Justino), chief of Vargas' personal guard, as the orderer of the frustrated assassination. This incident was one of the most importants in the history of Brazil.
Getulio is about the last days of Brazilian president Getulio Vargas, who killed himself with a shot to the heart in August 1954. The film explores the personal and political reasons that lead the former dictator, reelected by direct vote, to choose suicide over resignation in the midst of a serious crisis involving corruption and treason. It is a political thriller that has as its starting point a failed assassination attempt against Getulio's number one foe, and ends with the popular outcry caused by the President's death.
