An abstract film of Michael Snow's sculpture "Blind".
Using artist Michael Snow's sculpture "Blind", Hollis Frampton creates a series of abstractions using the wire mesh of the various fences making the sculpture. He brings the different layers of fence in and out of focus, plays with the brightness and darkness of the lighting, and creates a variety of different abstract shots with different camera angles. On occasion, a young man can sometimes be seen standing behind the mesh, who at the end emerges from the sculpture in a repeated loop.
