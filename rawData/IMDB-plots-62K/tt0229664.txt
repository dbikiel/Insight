Six old-style funny silhouetted fairy tales for not so-old-style people.
A group of animators are in their study trying to make a shadow puppet show with fables from different historical periods and come up with six sweet and naughty fairy-tales: The princess of Diamonds, the Boy and the Fig Tree, The witch, The Old Lady's Cape, The Crunch Queen and the Fabulo, and Prince and Princess. All the stories have a moral message but they are not as traditional as it might be thought.
Six old-style funny silhouetted fairy tales for not so-old-style peopleA group of animators are in their study trying to make a shadow puppet show with fables from different historical periods, collecting information about dresses, architecture and the style of the different eras. They come up with six fairy-tales: The princess of Diamonds, the Boy and the Fig Tree, The witch, The Old Lady's Cape, The Crunch Queen and the Fabulo, and Prince &amp; Princess. The discussions of the animators are intercalated between each story. As the old fables, they have a moral message and are very sweet, but they are very naughty and funny. Beware.
