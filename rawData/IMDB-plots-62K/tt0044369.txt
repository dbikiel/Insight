Apaches surround and attack a remote stage relay station trapping a stagecoach, passengers, cash box, a local bandit, a drifter and the station staff in a search for a killer of their tribesmen.
An outlaw murders several Apaches and flees to a stagecoach way station with the tribe in hot pursuit. A stagecoach and its passengers have just pulled into the station, as has the stationmaster's father, a former bandit named Peso, and they all find themselves besieged by the Apaches, who want them to turn over the killer to them or they'll take the station and kill everybody. The problem is that the people in the station aren't sure just who among therm is the actual killer.
