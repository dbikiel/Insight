Malasyan pirate Sandokan accidentally learns that Lord Brook plots to obtain the crown of Malasya by kidnapping the legitimate rajah and his daughter and forcing them to abdicate so he gathers his best man and launches a rescue operation.
In Victorian times, British colonial forces occupy Tapuah subduing the local population thru reprisals. Malaysian pirate Sandokan, whose family was killed by the British, gathers a small group of rebel followers and vows his revenge. Lord Hillock, commander of the British forces, is eager to capture the troublesome pirate. In order to entrap him, he arrests Sandokan's father, the Sultan of Mulaker. Hillock then sets a trap should Sandokan attempt to free his father. However, a wise Sandokan chooses to attack Lord Hillock's residence and kidnap Hillock's niece, Mary Ann, instead. Armed with a hostage, Sandokan can now negotiate with Hillock for an exchange of hostages. Lord Hillock has no intention of keeping his word, of course. Instead, he relentlessly pursues Sandokan and his small band through the jungles infested with native tribes of head-hunting Dayaks. To make matters worse, Sandokan suspects that one of his men is a traitor who somehow sends vital information about Sandokan's plans and movements to Lord Hillock.
