THE MANZANAR FISHING CLUB is a feature length documentary that chronicles the WWII internment of Japanese-American from a unique perspective: through the eyes of those who defied the armed guards, barbed wire and searchlights to fish for trout in the surrounding waters of the Eastern Sierra. By emphasizing the evacuees' personal stories it is the first internment film to go beyond the confinement itself, and instead highlight values - courage, responsibility and cooperation - that enable the human spirit. Interviews with noted experts provide new insights in to the social political backdrop of the internment. This is the untold story of those who refuse to knuckle under and risked it all to go fishing just like other ordinary Americans.
