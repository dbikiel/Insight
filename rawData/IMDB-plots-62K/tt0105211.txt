A father reminisces about his childhood when he and his younger brother moved to a new town with their mother, her new husband and their dog, Shane. When the younger brother is subjected to physical abuse at the hands of their brutal stepfather, Mike decides to convert their toy trolley, the "Radio Flyer", into a plane to fly him to safety.
A loving father explains the value of promise and believing to his two boys through the story of young Mike and his kid brother Bobby, who being abandoned by their dad had to move with ma and German shepherd Shane to a rural town where the local kids, lorded by abusive older scamp Victor Hernandez, consider them intruders 'stealing' their predecessors' place. Alas the friendly sheriff Daugherty, whose protection they politely wave, will have to act against a far worse bully, ma's new lover who expects to be called the king and belts Bobby's back brutally when drunk in the garage, a secret the boys want to keep secret for finally happy ma. The superstitious brothers spend their time exploring, pulling a wheeled red wagon called Radio Flyer, which name finally inspires a desperate 'magical escape' attempt...
