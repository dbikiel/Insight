A well-to-do Connecticut family is upended when the grown daughter's godparents, seized by a nameless terror, decide to come live with them.
In Connecticut, Agnes and Tobias are an upper-class married couple whose relationship has been uneasy for many years, since at least the time their son died; but they've managed to find a certain comfortable pattern of uneasiness. Agnes's sister, Claire, lives with them and insists that her perpetual drinking is not alcoholism but willfulness. Their daughter, Julia, poised to have her fourth divorce, has come back home. Unexpectedly, her room has been taken over by Harry and Edna, best friends of Tobias and Agnes. Seized by a nameless terror that propelled them out of their own house, Harry and Edna have decided to stay.
The setting is the comfortable Connecticut home of a well-to-do family. Agnes is a determined, powerful woman who feels she must hold her husband together and present a brave face to the world. Her husband, Tobias, is both retired and retiring, a man who cannot quite face up to life. Living with the couple is Agnes' sister, Claire, an alcoholic who sees through and scoffs at the insincerity and pretensions around her. Clare's outrageous comments are meant as much to reflect her own bitterness as to shake Tobias out of his mute acceptance of Agnes' dominance. They are soon joined by Harry and Edna, a married couple who are Agnes and Tobias' best friends and Agnes and Tobias' spoiled 36-year old daughter, Julia, who returns home from her fourth broken marriage.
