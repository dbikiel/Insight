The Hollywood Memorial Park cemetery was run down and bankrupt. Tyler Cassity, a young visionary from St. Louis, bought it for a song. Not only did he renovate the cemetery (the burial place of many of Hollywood's most famous actors and filmmakers), he is in the process of remaking the whole funeral industry, by focusing on the memorial aspects, producing documentaries of the lives of even ordinary people. The hip but respectful and caring approach is in vivid contrast to the traditional funeral business, represented here by Forest Lawn.
