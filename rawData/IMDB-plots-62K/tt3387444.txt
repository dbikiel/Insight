A mysterious old sailor arrives in Grey Rocks, Nova Scotia and meets a young boy and mother whom he offers to help for his own reasons.
In 1950s Grey Rocks, Nova Scotia, a mysterious old seadog named Captain Charles Johnson comes to port and takes up residence in the inn of Kerstin Hawkins and her son, Jim. Once there, young Jim realizes that there is far more to that old sailor than meets the eye as Johnson offers to help on a school project about pirates in the region in ways Jim never imagined. Along the way, Capt. Johnson learns of the threat that a modern day pirate, the rapacious Mr. Moehner, poses and offers to help with that as well. All the while, that old sailor has his own business in that small town with a more direct link to its past that only Jim knows is possible.
