Love has no borders and therein lies the premise of the charming, new Iranian-American romantic comedy "Shirin in Love." Nazanin Boniadi plays Shirin, an absent-minded, young Iranian-American living in "Tehrangeles" (the large Iranian community in Los Angeles) with her overbearing mother and empathetic father. Despite being engaged for years to a successful Iranian plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills, Shirin finds herself breaking loyalty and tradition when she falls in love with a mysterious young man who lives in a lighthouse in northern California. As her secret unravels and cultures clash, Shirin discovers what it ultimately means to be true to herself.
