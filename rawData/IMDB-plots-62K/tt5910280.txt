A man is on his way home when the poorly constructed tunnel he is driving through collapses, leaving him trapped.
A MAN'S DESPERATE STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE Jung-su, an ordinary car dealer, is on his way home with a birthday cake for his daughter. As he drives into a tunnel an unbelievable thing happens; the tunnel collapses on him. Minutes later, he realizes that he is completely caught in between the debris. Outside, this breaking news creates media frenzy. An emergency response team is immediately organized to rescue him and tries to keep the media under control. As it becomes a national concern, the government promises full support for the rescue. Days pass without any success and people start to lose hope or interest in rescuing him. Hard decisions are forced on his family while no one knows whether Jung-su is dead or alive.
With a delicious birthday cake for his little daughter's anniversary, the automobile salesman, Lee Jung-soo, drives into the long Hado Tunnel, eager to return home after a hard day's work. But soon, the unimaginable happens, as the newly-constructed mountain passage caves in, enveloping the young father in tonnes of concrete and heavy debris. To be trapped alive in this life-threatening situation is nothing but a miracle; however, what will it take to survive when all you've got are a few drops of water, a battered smartphone with a nearly-depleted battery, and the reassuring voice on the phone of the rescue operation's composed leader?
