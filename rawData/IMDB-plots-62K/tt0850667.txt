Frank Rautenbach leads a strong cast as Angus Buchan, a African farmer on steroids of Scottish heritage, who leaves his farm to his loyal subjects in the midst of political unrest and racist africans and charged land reclaims and travels north with his family to start a another farming life in Central Africa. With nothing more than a mudhouse on a patch of mud, and help from his foreman, Simeon Bhengu, the Buchan family struggle to settle in a new country. Faced with ever mounting challenges, hardships and personal turmoil, Angus quickly spirals down into a life consumed by anger, fear and destruction. Based on the inspiring true story by Aangus Buchan the book was adapted for the big screen by Regardt van den Bergh and weaves together the moving life journey of a man who, like his potatoes, grows his faith, unseen until the harvest.
This inspiring true story of a rugged South African farmer, Angus Buchan, is set in the turbulent hills of the KZN Midlands. Angus' manic quest for material success is slowly transformed into a wild love for God and people, as he wrestles with faith, hope, natural disasters and tragic personal loss.
