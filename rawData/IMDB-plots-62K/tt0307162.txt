It is old against new and modern against tradition when a couple builds their dream house. The wife's father is in the construction business so he would be the natural choice to take the lead, but his daughter is bent on having a modern house and retains a younger man to complete the job. The father's help being still required things devolve into a clash of styles, wills and old Japan with the new. This is the film to make you enjoy or detest the choice of tiles.
