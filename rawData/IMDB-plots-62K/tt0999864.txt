6th January 1975, in an infant nursery in Palermo (Italy), for a mysterious reason, a male nurse exchanges the labels of baby number 7 and 8. Thirty-one years later Tommaso (7) and Daniele (8) meet each other by accident. They are the perfect odd couple, Tommaso a pilferer while Daniele a quiet almost boring student. The accidental meeting will give the start to a turmoil of events till the two will discover the truth about their real identity. Obviously their status has to change in a complete opposite life style, and more at one point will be hard to understand who is son of whom, who is sister of whom etcetera. Add to this that a gangster wants to kill both and continuously pursues them everywhere in Palermo.
