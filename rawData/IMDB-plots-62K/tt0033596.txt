John Hathaway is a professor of psychology at Digby College. His students are bored as he is with the students. He leaves college to go to New York to have his manuscript on jealousy published. John and Julie go to Elliott Morgan Publishing to discuss his book. Being that it is highly technical and boring, Nellie wants to focus on the small part about couples that she thinks will sell. But it soon becomes apparent that everyone is more intrigued by Julie than the book. Elliott tries to make advances on Julie while Nellie is more interested in John than his book. Julie, however, is worried about John, while John, who wrote the book on jealousy, seems oblivious to it and thinks that he knows everything about jealousy.
