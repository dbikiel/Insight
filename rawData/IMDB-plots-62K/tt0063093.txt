When the daughter of Simon Crawford, a successful barrister, is killed in what seems to be a hit and run accident, and the police are unable to find the culprit, Crawford swears that he will find the driver of the car, and take revenge. Later when his neighbour is killed in a staged burglary, the blame falls on Crawford, when a letter is found implicating the neighbour in the death of Crawford's daughter.
