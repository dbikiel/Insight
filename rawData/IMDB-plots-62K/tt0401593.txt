A high school baseball coach (Krumholtz) and a down-on-his-luck private investigator (Burns) form a bond as they scour New York City for the coach's wife, who's run away with a second-rate rock star. As in Burns' previous films, the city itself becomes a character as the two men confront their fear of change and the familiar habit of loneliness.
