This is a remake of High Sierra with Humphrey Bogart and Ida Lapino.
Not quite as good as the original, although obviously talented, and great actors. Makes you wonder why they would remake a classic like High Sierra with minimal changes just 14 years later.
One interesting difference between the original and this movie... In the original they had a had a comical black man at the camp. The remake had a comical Hispanic. Both were incredibly insulting by current standards. It makes you wonder about the changes in culture from 1941 to 1955. They just found a new minority to insult.
