This fascinating moral thriller is centered on the bristling relationship between two very different young women in contemporary Tehran. Moving to the city for her studies and desperate for a place to live, the quiet, scholarly Nazanin (Nazanin Bayati) rents a room from vivacious shop girl Sahar (Pegah Ahangarani). The two become unlikely companions as Sahar coerces Nazanin into joining her circle of friends. But when Sahar ends up in trouble, Nazanin is drawn into a complex web of debt and deception that surrounds her roommate. With pitch-perfect performances by the two female leads, 'Trapped' draws an intelligent portrait of the subtleties of inter-personal power dynamics.
