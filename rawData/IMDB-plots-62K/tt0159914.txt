Based on Terry Pratchett's Novel. On Discworld (a world carried by four elephants standing on a huge turtle in space), a small girl, Susan Sto Helit, has got a major problem. Her grandfather is Death, who wants to forget that he has just "processed" his adopted daughter and her husband, who was Susan's mother and father, as this is causing him great grief, and Death is a person that can remember everything, much to his chagrin. Susan finds herself pressed into taking over Death's "duty", but finds that she is falling in love with an elf/human, Imp, who is slowly being taken over by a kind of "musical" force that is forcing Imp and his friends to play rock music to the Discworld. The rock music is proving to be a great success, but iit has plans for Imp and everybody wanting to play it, and it is up to Susan, the head of the wizards, the Archchancellor and Death (that is, if he can be found and made to remember who and what he is.) to stop it before it conquers the entire Discworld.
The young druid Imp y Celyn comes to Ankh-Morpork to become a famous musician, but a new guitar from a mysterious shop possesses him with a new kind of music - the Music with Rocks In. To make matters worse, Death, saddened by the death of his adopted daughter, has gone away to try and forget, and his granddaughter Susan suddenly has the family duty passed on to her.
