Bill Maher, creator of the immensely popular late-night talk show Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher and host of the HBO hit series Real Time with Bill Maher, displays his celebrated, biting wit in his fifth HBO stand-up comedy special, Bill Maher: Be More Cynical. Doing what he loves most, stand-up comedy, Maher rips through a horde of contemporary topics, from the evils of big government to the bewildering power women have over men, and delivers a landmark performance that re-affirms why he is one of today's brightest and most revered comedians.
