What a Man: The young teacher Alex is abandoned by his girlfriend Caroline and therefore begins a journey in search of himself. But how he overcomes the pitfalls out there for a modern man? And what is it that makes a man a man?
Nice guy Alex has gone well out of his way to accommodate his petulant and demanding girlfriend Carolin, so it comes as a complete surprise when he finds out she's cheated on him and thinks little of their relationship (ending it). As he actively questions if he's all the man he should be, best friends Okke and Nele stick loyally by his side to weather him through it.
