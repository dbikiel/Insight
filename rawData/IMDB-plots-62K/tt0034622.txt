An amnesiac French diplomat is blackmailed for crimes that he committed before he lost his memory.
1935. David Talbot is a successful and well-respected member of the French Foreign Service, currently based in Paris. Everything in his life is going his way: he is responsible for handling a large public trust, is pegged as the next French Ambassador to Brazil, and is still in the honeymoon phase of his marriage to his newlywed bride, Lucienne Talbot. He receives a letter addressed to "Jean" - he knowing it is for him as David Talbot is the addressee on the envelope - asking for the FF1 million owed. He eventually learns that the letter is he being accused of really being Jean Pelletier, who committed a bank robbery and murder in 1922, that 1 million half the take probably owed to Pelletier's partner(s). Part of David's known history is that he was long ago treated by Dr. Andre Tessier - still a close friend - for amnesia the result of a physical trauma, and that the one person who could positively identify him did so as David Talbot, that person now deceased. Everything that Tessier went through with him makes Tessier steadfastly believe he is David Talbot. David, too, does not believe the claim that he is Jean Pelletier, but two people clandestinely continue to provide him evidence that he truly is Pelletier, they, associates of Pelletier's, in want of that 1 million, nothing less. They are wine merchant Henri Sarrou, and cabaret singer Michelle Allaine. Although publicly cleared of the accusation, David cannot help but wonder if he really is Pelletier in the mounting evidence as he goes on a search himself for the truth. And Lucienne, knowing of the accusation but not knowing of the mounting pressure placed on David by Sarrou and/or Allaine, cannot help but wonder herself in knowing David for as short a time as she has despite her love for him.
