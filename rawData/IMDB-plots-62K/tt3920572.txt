The grim woes that surrounded famed director Peter Bogdanovich and his film, "They All Laughed."
One Day Since Yesterday: Peter Bogdanovich &amp; The Lost American Film is the story of maverick film director Peter Bogdanovich's love for both the late Dorothy Stratten and his "lost" film They All Laughed. This film tells of how his once 'Lost' film came to be championed by filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino, Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach, and of the sweet, makeshift family that's sprung up around They All Laughed's tragedies - bonds still strong more than 30 years later. One Day Since Yesterday is a wistful valentine to art, love, loss, redemption and the power of cinema.
