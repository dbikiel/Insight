A film producer struggles with suicidal despair.
In the first half, Gregoire, a movie producer of great charm, owner of Moon Films, plays with his younger daughters, talks with his wife and his eldest daughter, and keeps his studio going while one project hemorrhages money and creditors circle. In the second half, Sylvia, his Italian wife, tries to hold the family together as she looks fully into Moon Films' troubles. She meets with a banker, a temperamental Swede, Russian TV magnates, a film lab exec, and Moon's lawyer. Cl√©mence, the oldest daughter, goes on her own search. Debt can crush; how does a family pick up the pieces?
Gregoire Canvel has everything a man could want: a wife he loves, three delightful children
and his dream job - he is a film producer. Discovering talented filmmakers and developing
films that fit his conception of the cinema, free and true to life, is precisely his reason for
living.
Gregoire devotes almost all of his time and energy to his work. Although he spends weekends
with his family at their house in the country, even these precious moments are regularly
interrupted by demanding directors and concerned investors.
While Gregoires very presence commands admiration, and his exceptional charisma lead
many to believe he is invincible, the future of his prestigious production company, Moon
Films, is in doubt; too many productions, too many risks, too many debts. Storm clouds are
gathering, and Gregoires realisation that he may have made one gamble too many will trigger
a series of events that will change the lives of his family forever.
