Two young lonely people form a bond as they go through the homes of the recently departed people.
Two misfits and outcasts whose histories are filled with tragedy and trauma begin to come into their own as they become acquainted at work where they clean out the belongings of the deceased. Their past experiences, current encounters and the communication of it with each other helps the process of catharsis as they grapple with the memories that cannot be ignored or suppressed. The two not only bring into focus their dismal pasts, but also highlight the selfishness and inattentiveness of current society and its citizens.
