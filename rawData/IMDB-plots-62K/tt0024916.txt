A runaway heiress and her sister's husband join forces to race the latter's fast horse, Broadway Bill.
Tycoon J.L. Higgins controls his whole family, but one of his sons- in-law, Dan Brooks and his daughter Alice are fed up with that. Brooks quits his job as manager of J.L.'s paper box factory and devotes his life to his racing horse Broadway Bill, but his bank- roll is thin and the luck is against him, he is arrested because of $150 he owes somebody for horse food, but suddenly a planed fraud by somebody else seems to offer him a chance...
Magnate J.C. Higgins has 4 daughters. Three have presented him with sons-in-law to run his various enterprises...but son-in-law Dan Brooks would rather race horses, and youngest daughter 'Princess' Higgins is much fonder of him than his wife is. First Dan, and later Princess, run away from Higginsville, bent on running Dan's only asset, the horse Broadway Bill, in the Imperial Derby. Can they succeed before the creditors (and/or the gamblers) catch up with them? Will Dan ever realize that Princess loves him?
