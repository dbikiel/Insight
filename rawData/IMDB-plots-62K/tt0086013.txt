A creature from outer space crash lands in a small town and starts killing people.
Baltimore filmaker Don Dohler does an update on his 1979 film "The Alien Factor" this time only a single alien(reptilian looking)crash landing near a small town and going on a rampage.
A creature from outer space crash lands in Perry Hall, Maryland. It starts killing anyone it finds, either by shooting them with a ray gun or by ripping their guts out. The local sheriff, along with a deputy and several others, tries to kill the monster during shootouts, but bullets do not hurt it. The group evacuates the rest of the town and continues to fight.
