A widower and two of his sons become infatuated by their beautiful housekeeper, and all three set out to seduce her using their own unique methods.
A widower and his sons fall in love with Angela (Laura Antonelli), the beautiful housekeeper. Each man uses his particular way to approach and capture the - apparently innocent and naive - young woman, and to see more of her sexy body. But only one of them succeeds in dominating and conquering her.
Much to his surprise, on the same day of his wife's funeral, Don Ignazio, a middle-aged salesman, and father of 3 sons (Antonio, Enzino, and 14-year-old Nino), finds the gentle and stunning housekeeper, Angela ready to lift his spirit. Right from the beginning, Angela's presence inevitably sparks a rivalry among the older men of the house, particularly when the head of the family announces his intentions.
