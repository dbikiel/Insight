A mother of a poor family, has guests coming over, yet doesn't know how to get the dinner party altogether with limited resources.
Directed by Dariush Mehrjui, 'Mom's Guest' is set against the backdrop of the Iraq-Iran war, and tells the dark yet funny story of Mrs Effat, who, when unable to feed her newly arrived nephew and his bride, turns to those in her building for help. After having been persuaded to bring food and join her impromptu picnic, one by one, the neighbours begin to reveal their struggles and hardships. This light and simultaneously moving story of camaraderie is sympathetically brought to life by Golab Adineh, Roya Alemi, and Amin Hayayee.
A mother of a poor family, has guests coming over, yet doesnt know how to get the dinner party altogether with limited resources. The various characters in the family as well as neighbours all work together so the mother is able to save face in front of her guest. A real family film, where you won't cry or feel depressed. You'll get that feeling of family coming together and having dinner, telling jokes, etc...
