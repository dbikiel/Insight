In eighteenth century England, the mysterious masked rider known as the Scarecrow (Patrick McGoohan) leads a rebel band to save the town of Romney Marsh from King George III's (Eric Pohlmann's) oppression and Naval press gangs.
A poor eighteenth century English coastal farming community survives King George III's (Eric Pohlmann's) ruinous taxes thanks to a smuggling ring created by its masked leader called the Scarecrow (Patrick McGoohan). The ring's success leads King George III to order the Royal Army's General Pugh (Geoffrey Keen) to capture and execute the ringleaders. It is a battle of wits and action that the Scarecrow must win to save not only his own life, but those of the men he leads while keeping the vital smuggling operation running.
