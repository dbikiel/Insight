Four orphan boys running from the law in New York stumble upon a baby in a carriage. They name her Mary Rose and take her West with them. Eventually they set up a ranch which they name Rose Hill. Mary Rose grows up to be a beautiful woman and gets involved with a man who kills one of her brothers. The others then reveal that they found her in New York, and she goes back there to find her real family. While she's gone, Rose Hill starts falling apart: her oldest brother has fallen ill and the other two have gone their separate ways.
