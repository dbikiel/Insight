A sexy golddigger lands who she thinks is a wealthy big-game hunter from a royal family. What she doesn't know is that not only is he not wealthy, nor a big-game hunter nor from a royal family, but he's only a butler. Complications ensue as he tries to keep up the pretense.
When the wealthy Wall Street businessman Chester Hamilton is arrested for missing an alimony payment to his ex-wife, he finds his butler Oswald Groggs in the jail arrested for the same motive. Chester gives US$ 2,500.00 to Oswald to pay his debts, but the butler gives only part of the money to his ex-wife and travels to the seashore on vacation pretending to be the wealthy "Sir" Oswald Groggs. The gold digger Phyllis Van Kamp (a.k.a. Fanny Malone) mistakenly believes he is an aristocrat British playboy and has a brief affair with him. Oswald falls in love with her, pays her expensive hotel bill and buys a valuable ring among other presents; after draining his money, Fanny leaves him. Oswald returns to Chester's home only and has an unexpected surprise.
