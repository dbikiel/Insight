"Find Love" is the second feature from Uk writer/director Erica Dunton. It is the partly-improvised and partly-scripted story of two strangers who aren't looking for love but find it anyway. It is a twenty-four hour romance ride that truthfully captures that first feeling of falling for someone. Alexie Gilmore and Christian Camargo lead in this very real, almost documentary like, feature. They are supported by an incredible cast including Craig Sheffer, Traci Dinwiddie and Cullen Moss.
