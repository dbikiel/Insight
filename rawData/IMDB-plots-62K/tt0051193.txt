An immigrant Nevada rancher brings a woman from Italy to be his second wife but when he neglects her, she becomes involved with his trusted assistant. Nominated for 3 Academy Awards including Best Actor.
Italian immigrant Gino Micelli and his wife Rosanna started with virtually nothing, which Gino has now built up into a successful northern Nevada sheep farming operation with his brother Alberto, Alberto's wife Teresa, and their longtime hand, Bene. Gino hired Bene when he was just a boy and treats him like a son - planning on giving him the entire operation when the time comes - Bene being his true son which he has long planned as he has always seen Bene marrying his now twenty-one year old daughter, Angie, although neither Bene or Angie has ever said anything to Gino about it or has ever needed to say anything to the other in it never coming to pass in not feeling that way about the other. As Rosanna has long passed, and as Angie is away at school in Boston, Gino has made the decision to marry Rosanna's sister Gioia in Italy without the two even having met beforehand, she who will move to Nevada to live on the farm. Although Gino and Gioia both want the marriage to work, obstacles are raised in it truly being able to work. Knowing it or not, Gino wants her to be "Rosanna", who she is not either in true being or in temperament. As hard as Gino tries to please Gioia, his efforts always seem to be what he wants for her and not what she really wants. And while Gioia wants to be treated like a true human being and not the spirit of her dead sister, she also does not want her life mapped out for her like Gino seems to have done. Watching from the sidelines, Bene begins to develop feelings for Gioia himself, feelings which he knows can't continue as long as he remains in Gino's employ and remains Gino's friend.
