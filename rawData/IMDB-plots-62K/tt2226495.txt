An office worker is trapped inside the building where a killer is on the loose.
The ambitious legal assistant Tom Miller works at the Rosen, Byres and Emmerich Attorneys at Law and secretly dates the gorgeous clerk Anna. His company has presently two major cases: Hartcourt vs. Denning Pharmaceutical, against a powerful corporation, and Gambizzi Case, against a mafia family. On the eve of the judgment of the Hartcourt case, Alan Emmerich releases all the employees early in the afternoon and he also fires Tom for snooping around the Gambizzi case. When Tom is leaving the building with Anna, he sees a man leaving a suitcase on the floor and another man wearing a suit taking the suitcase and going to the 34th floor of the building. Tom decides to follow him and soon he discovers that he man is actually a hit-man. Soon Tom is trapped on the floor with the killer since his access card is deactivated. Who hired the hit-man?
As his powerful law firm prepares for one of its most important cases against Denning Pharmaceuticals, the lowly legal assistant, Thomas Miller, decides to shift his focus and concentrate on another challenging lawsuit, only to get fired. After an already rough day, things will soon go from bad to worse, when Thomas inadvertently notices strange occurrences after hours in the nearly empty office and a very suspicious suitcase swap between two strangers on their way to the thirty-fourth floor. One of them is a hired assassin, and, now, Thomas and a handful of his former co-workers working late are caught up in the middle of a deadly confrontation. Are those two cases linked? Above all, who is the contract killer's employer?
