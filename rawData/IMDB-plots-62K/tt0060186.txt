A seductive starlet flees Hollywood and causes chaos for a real estate agent.
The Divine Didi, a European actress known more for her bubble bath scenes than for her acting, decides she has had enough with bubble baths and wants to be taken seriously as an actress. So-much-so that during the filming of a bubble bath scene, she runs away and winds up in Oregon. While staying in a hotel, the operator accidentally connects her with a real estate agent named Tom Meade, instead of the kitchen, and asks him to bring her some food. When he does, he suggests she go to his cabin in the woods. She also asks him not to tell anyone where she is because she doesn't want to go back to Hollywood. Now Tom must keep the secret, especially from his wife and from his suspicious housekeeper Millie.
