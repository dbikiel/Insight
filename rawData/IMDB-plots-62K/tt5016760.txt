Heather Walsh tells her story of the time she was an emotional prisoner of Bill Cornelius at his remote farm.
When Heather Walsh accepted a tutoring job on an isolated farm in the Mangatiti Valley in 1985 she had no idea that what first appeared to be paradise, would become a nightmare. For 6 months she would be held captive, raped, and psychologically tortured by a seasoned predator until she made a daring escape. A true New Zealand story.
