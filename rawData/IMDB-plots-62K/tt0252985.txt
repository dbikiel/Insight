Giacomo meets Giovanni, his former best friend, with whom he quarreled three years before. Giovanni persuades him to go visit their third friend Aldo, who is dying in Sicily. Through flashbacks, we learn their story: Aldo was the phantom in operas, Giacomo was dubbing films in which he had only to make a noise without even talking, and Giovanni worked as a living dummy at the department store. Unsatisfied with their careers, they try to to stage a show of their own. However, women troubles separate them.
