A filmmaker holds a series of boundary-pushing auditions for his project about female pleasure.
François is a film-maker, usually impassive and without affect. He's making a film about women's pleasure as they transgress taboos. He doesn't know that two fallen angels who've been sent to upend him are manipulating his interest. He interviews young women, video tapes screen tests, and selects several for the film. The erotic scenes with them generate off-screen dynamics that may overwhelm the project. His wife is at first ignorant of his venture, then she's put off, and then becomes his assistant. The fallen angels are always close at hand: is François's ruin inevitable?
Under the restless and penetrating eye of two silent fallen angels doomed to obey, the committed and zealous filmmaker François attempts to delve deep into the very essence of taboos and document the female pleasure in an experimental film about the thrill of transgression. However, unbeknownst to François, silky, yet penetrating voices manipulate his ravenous curiosity dictating his next move. Is he really in charge? As a result, by mixing a raw child-like interest with an elegant intellectual sight, the director leaves room for erotic improvisation captured through a series of private auditions and undiluted screen tests. Surely, François is not a voyeur nor a pervert; he is just a mortal vessel of mystical testimonies, still, oblivious to the dangers and repercussions of playing with fire.
