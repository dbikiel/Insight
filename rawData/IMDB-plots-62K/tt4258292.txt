Sathyadev, a sincere police officer, tries to stop an organ trafficking racket. But he is unaware that the man performing the illegal trade is the same person who killed his beloved.
The life of a young boy, Sathyadev, takes a destined route when his father becomes an incidental casualty in a scene of crime. The I.P.S. route takes away from him, a loving wife-to-be and renders a child motherless. It also gives him a prominent enemy, Victor, who makes a comeback into his life as the perpetrator when he is attempting to solve a kidnap case. And like the narrative tells at that very moment - 'All hell breaks loose' and culminates in a riotous climax.
A teenager's father is brutally murdered, spurring him to become a forthright police officer. When his friendship with a gangster turns into bitter enmity and endangers the lives of his loved ones, he must use all his skills to ensure their safety.
