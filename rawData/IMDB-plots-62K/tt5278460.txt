A look at the effects that online bullying has on the lives of teenagers and their community.
A sobering documentary showing teenage girls in the U.S. being victims of sexual assault by their male classmates/friends. It also covers the unfortunate trend that the system tends to minimize or even dismiss these cases, resulting in the victimized girls not receiving justice. To make matters worse, these girls often ended up getting bullied (both in school as well as online) for being rape victims.
