Seven people in a therapy group are forced to find new ways of coping with their problems when their therapist dies in the middle of a session.
A group of eight patients, each obsessed with their own personal neurosis, receive therapy from an elderly psychoanalyst. When the lady suddenly dies in the middle of a session, they find themselves orphaned. What can they do? While Alfredo, an obese guy with religious obsessions, claims he is healed, the seven others decide to complete their group therapy. They try hard to find a new shrink but to no avail. So why not do the job themselves? Which is easier said than done.
