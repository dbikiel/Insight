After causing restaurant chaos at work, a bumbling waiter tears up the local roller rink with his skating.
After amusements working in a restaurant, Charlie uses his lunch break to go roller skating. Mr. Stout makes advances toward the unwilling Edna (whose father and Mrs. Stout had earlier carried on in the restaurant). After a roller skate ballet, Charlie (now as Sir Cecil Seltzer) is invited to a party at Edna's. All the "couples", including a new partner for Mr. Stout. show up.
To earn a living, poor Charlie works as a waiter at an upscale restaurant--a hard and demanding job, especially when one has to deal with an ever-watching ma√Ætre d', and the irascible customer, Mr Stout. As one little mishap paves the way for another, Charlie takes a lunch break and heads over to the local roller skating rink, only to stumble into the charming roller-skater, Edna, who has been having a problem with a persistent admirer--Mr Stout. To express her gratitude, Edna invites him to an elegant skating party; however, Charlie, now posing as the noble Sir Cecil Seltzer, seems to know a lot about the Stouts' shenanigans. But, can Charlie keep a secret?
