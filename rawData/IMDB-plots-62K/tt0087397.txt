Blue and Eli, two friends, have problems with women. Blue, a yet-to-be discovered painter is left by his longtime girlfriend, because she considers him too immature for a long lasting relationship. Eli works in his father's aerobic suit business and is still searching for a woman who is interesting enough to spend more than one night with her. Blue and Eli's friendship is put to a severe test as both fall in love with Liliane, Blue's attractive new gallerist.
