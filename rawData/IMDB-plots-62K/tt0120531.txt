Gorgeous and extravert Woo meets insecure and straight-laced law clerk Tim at a blind date.
Darlene "Woo" Bates, played by Jada Pinkett Smith, has been dumped a little bit too many times, now this femme-fatale doesn't let just any man swing with her, and when she's set up on a blind-date with Tommy Davidson's character, it could be love.. if they don't kill each other first. "Woo" features cameos by Foxy Brown, LL Cool J, and Duane Martin.
While on a strangely combined blind date Darlene, who is tired of being spurned by men, and Tim, who is very straight forward and a by-the-book kind of man, spend the night in Manhattan creating comical chaos and damage.
